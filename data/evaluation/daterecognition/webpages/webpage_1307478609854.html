<h3 id="a014584" class="title"><a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/backdoor-amnest.html">Backdoor Amnesty</a></h3>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 11:20 AM


</p>

<p>Obama's agenda is so extreme and so obviously destructive that he can't even get the rest of it through a Congress controlled by leftists like Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. No matter &mdash; as the country lurches toward socialist dictatorship, Congress is becoming increasingly irrelevant.</p>

<p>Cap &amp; Trade is too obviously intended to send unemployment skyrocketing, so even after ramming it through the House, our liberal rulers gave up on getting it past the Senate, knowing that Obama can simply <a href="http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2010/05/epa_tightens_industrial_air_pollution_rules.html">impose it through the malignant and unaccountable EPA</a>.</p>

<p>Likewise, the amnesty Obama is counting on for reelection will be snuck in through the back door, just like the tens of millions of unskilled Third World peasants who will be exploited to overwhelm the will of American voters in exchange for welfare benefits &mdash; as a White House memo <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/29/memo-outlines-backdoor-amnesty-plan-for-obama/">confirms</a>:</p>

<blockquote>With Congress gridlocked on an immigration bill, the Obama administration  is considering using a back door to stop deporting many illegal immigrants &mdash; what a draft government memo said could be "a non-legislative version of amnesty."</blockquote>

<blockquote>The memo, addressed to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas and written by four agency staffers, lists tools it says the administration has to "reduce the threat of removal" for many illegal immigrants who have run afoul of immigration authorities.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, USCIS can extend benefits and/or protections to many individuals and groups by issuing new guidance and regulations, exercising discretion with regard to parole-in-place, deferred action and the issuance of Notices to Appear," the staffers wrote in the memo, which was obtained by Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The memo suggests that in-depth discussions have occurred on how to keep many illegal immigrants in the country, which would be at least a temporary alternative to the proposals Democrats in Congress have made to legalize illegal immigrants.</blockquote>

<p>America's answer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidkun_Quisling">Vidkun Quisling</a> is running the government. Norway survived Nazi occupation. Whether America will survive occupation by Barack Hussein Obama and his supporters is doubtful. Their goal is to "fundamentally transform" America by obliterating it &mdash; economically, politically, and demographically &mdash; so that there will be nothing left to liberate.</p>

<p>If this is what they act like after getting their way, imagine what will happen when our backs are flat against the wall and we finally start putting up resistance. But of course, Obama's <a href="http://www.sodahead.com/united-states/seiu-prez-union-spent-607-million-to-elect-obama/blog-73625/">bankrollers</a> at the SEIU didn't <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2010/07/28/open-bordersseiu-caravan-to-arizona-you-read-it-here-first/">bus in these vermin from Los Angeles</a> just to enjoy the summer heat.</p>

<p>As the flags make insolently obvious, these people are profoundly hostile to the United States. They represent two objectives: the demographic "reconquest" of the Southwest (hence the Mexican flag), and the imposition of communism (hence the Cuban flag complete with the face of the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article2461399.ece">psychotic executioner</a> Che Guevara). They are backed to the hilt by the federal government and our liberal-infested courts.</p>

<p>America is literally under siege from within.</p>

<p>You have to assume this stuff actually works with moonbats.

<p>In the real world, the best solution is the simplest one that works. But in the world of Big Government, the opposite is the case, because the objective is never the job at hand, but to increase the already massive weight of the bureaucracy. This is why anything to do with progressive government rapidly grows in size and complexity, while becoming correspondingly ever less efficient.</p>

<p>Via <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2010/jul/28/republicans-release-new-more-complex-obamacare-cha/">The Washington Times</a>, the ObamaCare abomination started off looking like this:</p>

<div align="center"><img alt="obamacare-1.jpg" src="http://www.moonbattery.com/obamacare-1.jpg" width="550" height="424" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></div>

<p>Now it looks like this:</p>

<div align="center"><img alt="obamacare-2.jpg" src="http://www.moonbattery.com/obamacare-2.jpg" width="550" height="431" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></div>

<p>By the time it's implemented in full, it will look like this:</p>

<div align="center"><img alt="tangled-mess.jpg" src="http://www.moonbattery.com/tangled-mess.jpg" width="330" height="280" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></div>

<p>&hellip;and your tax bill to pay vast armies of bureaucrats to micromanage your life and destroy our healthcare system will look like this:</p>

<p>Our moonbat rulers didn't finish making history after installing America's first Affirmative Action president.

<blockquote>History was made this week in a little noticed ceremony in Washington when the U.S. Navy awarded its "Sailor of the Year" award to four women.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is a great day for our Navy, and today we are making history with all for [sic] Sailors of the Year being women.</blockquote>

<p>Wow, what a coincidence that in the overwhelmingly male Navy, the four most accomplished sailors are all women.</p>

<p>What's really surprising is that one of them looks Caucasian. Maybe she made up for her ethnic deficiencies by converting to Islam.</p>

<p>Next year, the Navy will make history again by just happening to name a left-handed homosexual Eskimo dwarf with two club feet as "Sailor of the Year."</p>

<p>Political correctness has gone beyond turning awards into farces. They've become badges of condescension and shame. Since the actual accomplishments of these women are irrelevant, they will never be meaningfully acknowledged.</p>

</p>

<p>Just as no good deed goes unpunished, no act of evil remains unrewarded for long &mdash; much less a whole career of evil that reached its crescendo with a denunciation of Jews so tasteless that not even the liberal establishment media could stomach it. This is why the Muslim colonists infesting Dearbornistan are <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20100729/NEWS05/7290441/1320/Helen-Thomas-statue-stirs-controversy">erecting a statue of Helen Thomas</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The Dearborn-based Arab American National Museum has launched an online fund-raiser at www.kickstarter.com to get $10,000 to finish a sculpture of Thomas, 89, who was born to immigrants from Lebanon. &hellip; The total cost of the statue is $25,000-$30,000, said Anan Ameri, the museum's director.</blockquote>

<p>I'd be surprised if taxes aren't making up most of the difference. No problem, Michigan is <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20100727/NEWS06/7270333/Michigan-poverty-levels-up">flush with cash</a> these days.</p>

<p>Thomas will be best remembered for demanding (at a Jewish heritage celebration) that Jews "get the hell out" of their homeland and relocate to Germany and Poland, where not long ago they were butchered by the millions.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  8:31 AM


</p>

<p>No wonder liberals are so sympathetic to Muslim terrorists. Their tactics have a lot in common &mdash; especially regarding <a href="http://cbs4denver.com/news/sheepskin.fire.arrest.2.1829903.html">animal rights kooks</a>. From increasingly moonbat-infested Colorado:</p>

<blockquote>The man suspected [of] torching the Sheepskin Factory in Glendale was back in a federal courtroom Wednesday morning. &hellip; Prosecutors say [Walter] Bond has been involved in an alarming and dramatic escalation in crimes since his 1997 arson conviction in Iowa. He will be held without bond [no pun intended]. The judge called him a flight risk and a danger to the community.</blockquote>

<p>The ultimate danger to our national community is the wildly metastasizing liberalism that produces these maniacs.</p>

<blockquote>Bond is what is called a "Vegan Straightedge." It means he's somebody who doesn't eat animals and has made a vow not to use alcohol, drugs, or take part in promiscuous sex. A tattoo of "vegan" is written on his neck and "straightedge" on his arm.</blockquote>

<p>You had to know it was only a matter of time before progressives revived their old jihad against alcohol. Maybe prohibition, like communism, will work fine once we have the right rulers in place.</p>

<p>A lefty refraining from promiscuous sex is an encouraging development. But then, judging by his mug shot, abstinence may be Bond's only option:</p>

<div align="center"><img alt="walter-bond.jpg" src="http://www.moonbattery.com/walter-bond.jpg" width="320" height="240" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></div>

<p>Lest you think Bond is out of the mainstream among his fellow moonbats:</p>

<blockquote>Some websites are now posting calls of support for Bond.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I think burning down a building can be a very effective way of stopping animal suffering when it's done strategically," said Peter Young, who runs the website Voice of the Voiceless.</blockquote>

<p>By the way, the Sheepskin Factory doesn't even harm animals. It uses skin from sheep that have already been killed for food &mdash; which is what sheep are for.</p>

</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/department-of-j.html">As noted yesterday</a>, the Obama/Holder Justice Department has been suppressing the votes of our men and women in uniform. But before you judge our liberal rulers too harshly, keep in mind that they make up for it by <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/28/holder-puts-felons-over-soldiers/">encouraging voting by felons</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The Justice Department is so unenthusiastic about military voting that its website still lists the old requirement for a shorter 30-day military voting window, rather than the current law mandating 45 days. On the other hand, the Justice Department has no legislative mandate whatsoever to involve itself with helping felons to vote, but its website devotes a large section &mdash; 2,314 words &mdash; to advising felons how to regain voting privileges.</blockquote>

<p>Here we have American politics in a nutshell. There is the party that honors patriots who lay their lives on the line for our freedom, and there is the party that honors lowlife criminal scum as it eats away at that freedom like some horrific form of gangrene.</p>

<p>We now have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/health/boostershots/la-heb-mentalhealth-20100728,0,2495137.story">confirmation</a> that psychiatric problems are endemic in the Land of Fruits and Nuts, the seedbed of progressivism that has been following liberal ideology off the edge of a cliff into failed state status.</p>

<blockquote>Almost 5 million California adults say they could use help with a mental or emotional problem, according to a survey released Wednesday by researchers at UCLA. About 1 million of them meet the criteria for "serious psychological distress."</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, only one in three people who perceive a need for mental health services or are in serious distress have seen a professional for treatment, the survey found.</blockquote>

<p>Not to worry, once the government forces everybody else to pay for everybody's healthcare, California voters won't be too cheap to seek psychiatric assistance.</p>

<blockquote>The survey showed that lack of health insurance coverage was a major reason why people didn't seek help &mdash; a situation that may be rectified somewhat by state and national mental health parity laws now in effect that require insurers to cover mental health conditions similarly to they way they cover physical conditions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Last month, the Fremont city council made headlines for passing an immigration law similar to Arizona's. Like Arizona, Fremont faced lawsuit threats from organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund (MALDEF). While at the time the Fremont City Council promised to enforce the voter-supported bill, they are now backing down, at least temporarily, in the face of legal challenges.</blockquote>

<p>We know what the Obama Administration wants: tens of millions of new welfare dependents with a grudge against Whitey who will provide demographic support for the imposition of socialism.

<p>Under Comrade Obama, it isn't enough for the Department of "Justice" to <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-2684-Law-Enforcement-Examiner~y2010m7d9-Justice-Dept-whistleblower-ignored-by-news-media">facilitate voter intimidation</a> by <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2008/03/new_black_panth.html">BHO's friends</a> at the <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/obama-ward-call.html">New Black Panthers</a>. It is also crucial to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/28/exclusive-doj-stalls-voter-registration-law-military/">suppress the military vote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The Department of Justice is ignoring a new law aimed at protecting the right of American soldiers to vote, according to two former DOJ attorneys who say states are being encouraged to use waivers to bypass the new federal Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment (MOVE) Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The MOVE Act, enacted last October, ensures that servicemen and women serving overseas have ample time to get in their absentee ballots. The result of the DOJ's alleged inaction in enforcing the act, say Eric Eversole and J. Christian Adams &mdash; both former litigation attorneys for the DOJ's Voting Section &mdash; could be that thousands of soldiers' ballots will arrive too late to be counted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is an absolute shame that the section appears to be spending more time finding ways to avoid the MOVE Act, rather than finding ways to ensure that military voters will have their votes counted," said Eversole, director of the Military Voter Protection Project, a new organization devoted to ensuring military voting rights. "The Voting Section seems to have forgotten that it has an obligation to enforce federal law, not to find and raise arguments for states to avoid these laws."</blockquote>

<p>At least the Feds don't actively forbid states from enforcing the law, <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/quislings-sacri.html">as they do with immigration law</a>.</p>

<p>How ironic that the guys over there laying their lives on the line to defend our Constitutional liberties are sent into battle (with their hands tied by demented rules of engagement) by people who regard our Constitution as <a href="http://butasforme.com/2008/10/27/shock-audio-obama-thinks-constitution-flawed-exclusive/">fundamentally flawed</a>, and who repay them for their service by denying them the right to vote.</p>

</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/educrats-demand.html">Jen Keeton</a> isn't the only graduate student to be struck down by the heavy hand of the liberal establishment for upholding Christian values in the face of militant depravity; nor is <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/quislings-sacri.html">Arizona</a> the only recent victim of black-robed liberal ideologues. Another appalling case is that of <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20100727/NEWS06/100727038/1320/Anti-gay-EMU-social-work-student-loses-appeal">Julea Ward</a></p>

<p>A counseling major at Eastern Michigan University, Julea asked to be removed from a case rather than be forced to affirm perverted sexual practices that she rightly regards as morally abhorrent. When EMU educrats responded to this heresy by throwing her out, she took them to court. Unsurprisingly, in light of the caliber of people who run our judiciary, this didn't end well. In ruling against her, U.S. District Judge George Steeh proclaimed:</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff was not required to change her views or religious beliefs; she was required to set them aside in the counselor-client relationship &mdash; a neutral, generally applicable expectation of all counselors-to-be under the ACA (American Counseling Association) standard."</blockquote>

<p>Likewise, when the government has finished consolidating control over the healthcare system, Christians will not be required to change their religious beliefs; they'll just be required to perform abortions anyway.</p>

<p>How open-minded of the courts to allow us to believe in right versus wrong, so long as we keep those beliefs to ourselves and don't let them prevent us from doing whatever our degenerate masters command.</p>

</p>

<p>Arizona's measured attempt to defend itself from foreign invasion was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-na-arizona-immigration-20100729,0,3606702.story">gutted</a> today by Clinton-appointed apparatchik Susan Bolton, using legal "reasoning" that was probably not even intended to be taken seriously. A state that is facing economic and societal collapse due to Mexican colonization is officially not permitted to enforce immigration law. We are moving into the end game now &mdash; the point where America's collectivist enemies dismantle the country.</p>

<p>Imagine an electoral map with the entire Southwest turned from mostly red to deep blue, inhabited predominantly by unskilled Third World peasants on welfare. The people running our government have imagined it. They know what it will mean: one-party socialist rule.</p>

<p>Our country will either rot to death or be torn apart in civil war, but that's a price the Left is more than willing to pay to consolidate power.</p>

<p>Anyone who has spent time around liberals knows how much they hate America. Unsurprisingly, now that they have their boot on the neck of the world's Last Best Hope, they are stomping down with all their might.</p>

<p>It would be better to see Chinese tanks rolling down Phoenix's Central Avenue than to be ruled by the socialist quislings who control the federal government and our courts. At least then everyone would understand that America is under enemy occupation and cannot let it continue.</p>

<p>Reagan said that freedom was never more than a single generation removed from extinction. If we don't start fighting like wild, we will be the generation that lets the torch go out.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 11:19 AM


</p>

<p>The Left tends to get away with its crimes, all the way from Bill Clinton lying under oath to Stalin and Mao murdering their own subjects by the millions. But at last one of the major moonbats in Cambodia's Khmer Rouge has faced justice, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100726/ap_on_re_as/as_cambodia_genocide_tribunal;_ylt=AnWUV_Fop.Qqx4UPMfMIpYbOsb1_;_ylu=X3oDMTNpdjJqNHVsBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTAwNzI2L2FzX2NhbWJvZGlhX2dlbm9jaWRlX3RyaWJ1bmFsBGNjb2RlA21vc3Rwb3B1bGFyBGNwb3MDMwRwb3MDMwRzZWMDeW5fdG9wX3N0b3JpZXMEc2xrA2tobWVycm91Z2VqYQ--">sort of</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, was the first major Khmer Rouge figure to face trial more than three decades after the "killing fields" regime tried to turn the country into a vast agrarian society &mdash; leading to the deaths of 1.7 million people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As commander of the top secret Tuol Sleng prison &mdash; code-named S-21 &mdash; the 67-year-old Duch admitted to overseeing the torture and deaths of as many as 16,000 people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He was sentenced to 35 years in prison, but will spend only 19 in jail&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>Duch has something in common with other dangerous left-wing extremists throughout the world, including America, where communist terrorists like Bill Ayers can be found on college faculties:</p>

<blockquote>Like many key players in the Khmer Rouge, Duch was an academic before he became a revolutionary.</blockquote>

<p>If you've ever wondered what the country would look like if an Ivy League faculty took control of it, study up on the Khmer Rouge's <a href="http://www.roch.edu/course/doors2cambodia/cambodia._killing_fields.html">Killing Fields</a>.</p>

<p>Duch was a math teacher, so he's probably already figured this out: 19 years = 6,935 days = 166,440 hours &divide; 16,000 people he murdered = 10.4 hours per murder. Not bad, considering Clinton wasn't in a position to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pardonchartlst.htm">pardon</a> him.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 10:01 AM


</p>

<p>Readers of Moonbattery will know better than to think the government's recent financial overhaul power grab had anything whatsoever to do with draining the swamp that has developed around the revolving door between Wall Street and Big Government. <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2010/07/28/sec-says-new-finreg-law-exempts-public-disclosure/">But for the edification of trolls:</a></p>

<blockquote>Under a little-noticed provision of the recently passed financial-reform legislation, the Securities and Exchange Commission no longer has to comply with virtually all requests for information releases from the public, including those filed under the Freedom of Information Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The law, signed last week by President Obama, exempts the SEC from disclosing records or information derived from "surveillance, risk assessments, or other regulatory and oversight activities." Given that the SEC is a regulatory body, the provision covers almost every action by the agency, lawyers say. Congress and federal agencies can request information, but the public cannot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That argument comes despite the President saying that one of the cornerstones of the sweeping new legislation was more transparent financial markets. Indeed, in touting the new law, Obama specifically said it would "increase transparency in financial dealings."</blockquote>

<p>Once again, the Manchurian Moonbat was transparently lying.</p>

<p>The SEC is already using the new law to defend itself from public scrutiny:</p>

<blockquote>The SEC cited the new law Tuesday in a FOIA action brought by FOX Business Network. Steven Mintz, founding partner of law firm Mintz & Gold LLC in New York, lamented what he described as "the backroom deal that was cut between Congress and the SEC to keep the  SEC's failures secret. The only losers here are the American public."</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the SEC's interpretation stands, Mintz, who represents FOX Business Network, predicted "the next time there is a Bernie Madoff failure the American public will not be able to obtain the SEC documents that describe the failure," referring to the shamed broker whose Ponzi scheme cost investors billions.</blockquote>

<p>It's no surprise our rulers want Fox to stop poking its nose into the SEC's business.</p>

<blockquote>FOX Business Network sued the SEC in March 2009 over its failure to produce documents related to its failed investigations into alleged investment frauds being perpetrated by Madoff and R. Allen Stanford. Following the Madoff and Stanford arrests it, was revealed that the SEC conducted investigations into both men prior to their arrests but failed to uncover their alleged frauds.</blockquote>

<p>Now that Big Government has imposed a little more Obama-style "transparency," Fox Business will be kept in the dark regarding what these kleptocrats are doing with our money &mdash; as will the rest of us.</p>

<p>Time will tell what other outrages are buried in the thousands of pages of crap Congress has been passing for Comrade Obama's eager signature quicker than grease through a goose with cholera.</p>

<h3 id="a014555" class="title"><a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/ny-times-white.html">NY Times: White House Is Still Too White</a></h3>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  8:38 AM


</p>

<p>New York Times harridan Maureen Down stopped dragging her nails down a chalkboard (or was that her voice?) long enough to lay a finger on what the White House is missing. Competence? No. Experience? No. Leadership, patriotism, sanity? No, no, no. The White House under our first Affirmative Action President, a guy who attended a black supremacist "church" for 20 years, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/opinion/25dowd.html?_r=4&ref=maureendowd">doesn't have enough blacks</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The Obama White House is too white. &hellip; The first black president should expand beyond his campaign security blanket, the smug cordon of overprotective white guys surrounding him &mdash; a long political tradition underscored by Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 when she complained about the "smart-ass white boys" from Walter Mondale's campaign who tried to boss her around.</blockquote>

<p>Dowd herself is Caucasian. Despising your own ethnic group for its accomplishments is among the major symptoms of liberalism, a loathsome pathology that is literally destroying our country.</p>

<p>Naturally Dowdy blames not Comrade Obama but any white guy who happened to have been near him for throwing Shirley Sherrod under the bus before the media could orchestrate a campaign to repackage the racist apparatchik as a crusader against racism.</p>

<blockquote>The West Wing white guys who pushed to ditch Shirley Sherrod before Glenn Beck [who actually defended Sherrod] could pounce not only didn't bother to Google, they weren't familiar enough with civil rights history to recognize the name Sherrod.</blockquote>

<p>Like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and other militant racists, the Sherrods have been active in the farcical remnants of the "Civil Rights" movement. Anyone who thinks this argues in favor of their color-blind mentality has been asleep since MLK died. You don't get invited to speak at the NAACP by saying nice things about Caucasians. Further confirmation that the Sherrods cling to the ever-stylish (among liberals) "down with Whitey" mentality can be found <a href="http://www.riehlworldview.com/carnivorous_conservative/2010/07/video-shirley-sherrod-is-a-racist-and-a-marxist.html">here</a> and <a href="http://riehlworldview.com/carnivorous_conservative/2010/07/sherrod-we-must-stop-the-white-man-and-his-uncle-toms-.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>But wait, Dowd isn't done making her case:</p>

<blockquote>As [John] Lewis, the longtime Georgia congressman, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, he knew immediately that something was amiss with the distorted video clip of Sherrod talking to the N.A.A.C.P.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I've known these two individuals &mdash; the husband for more than 50 years and the wife for at least 35, 40 &mdash; and there's not a racist hair on their heads or anyplace else on their bodies," Lewis said.</blockquote>

<p>Lewis, described by Dowd as a "civil rights hero," is a racialist bomb-thrower of the lowest order. The <a href="http://biggovernment.com/sright/2010/07/13/breitbart-exposes-the-n-word-lie-on-hannity/">provably false</a> claim that he and Rep. Andre Carson (D-IN) were called the forbidden N-word 15 times by Tea Partiers in front of hundreds of witnesses may be the second lowest point in American history, after Barack Hussein Obama's election. To present this race-baiting liar as an authority on who is or is not a racist is absurd even by the shady Gray Lady's standards.</p>

<p>Any country run by people who take seriously the adolescent crap they read in the New York Times is in very serious trouble.</p>

Barney Frank, a corrupt degenerate who has played a major role in looting the next several generations of Americans to the brink of bankruptcy, throws a tantrum over a $1 senior discount on his way to wallow in a cesspool of perversion:</p>

<blockquote>Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank caused a scene when he demanded a $1 senior discount on his ferry fare to Fire Island's popular gay haunt, The Pines, last Friday. Frank was turned down by ticket clerks at the dock in Sayville because he didn't have the required Suffolk County Senior Citizens ID. A witness reports, "Frank made such a drama over the senior rate that I contemplated offering him the dollar to cool down the situation." Frank made news last year when he was spotted looking uncomfortable around a bevy of topless, well-built men at the Pines Annual Ascension Beach Party.</blockquote>

<p>Time to revise the old joke:</p>

<blockquote>Q: How was the Grand Canyon formed?<br/>

</p>

<p>Our rulers are transnationalist. When they pass our money around to their buddies, it doesn't matter to them whether it ends up in this country or another &mdash; <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2010-07-24-goldman-bailout-cash_N.htm">as the crony capitalists at Goldman Sachs confirm</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Goldman Sachs received a $12.9 billion payout from the government's bailout of AIG, which was at one time the world's largest insurance company.</blockquote>

<p>Why did the money go to Goldman Sachs? Because there is a highly lucrative <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/04/21/92637/goldmans-connections-to-white.html">revolving door</a> between GS and the White House.</p>

<p>From there much of the loot went abroad:</p>

<blockquote>Goldman Sachs sent $4.3 billion in federal tax money to 32 entities, including many overseas banks, hedge funds and pensions, according to information made public Friday night.</blockquote>

<p>Friday night is always the time for information embarrassing to our rulers to be dumped down a media black hole. It was only released at all under threat of subpoena from Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA).</p>

<blockquote>The initial $85 billion to bail out AIG was supplemented by an additional $49.1 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, as well as additional funds from the Federal Reserve. AIG's debt to U.S. taxpayers totals $133.3 billion outstanding. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>AIG received the bailout of $85 billion at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which was led at the time by Timothy Geithner. He now is U.S. treasury secretary.</blockquote>

<p>At his "discretion," this tax cheat stole $85 billion of our money and passed it out among his friends both here and abroad.</p>

<p>Our country is ruled by criminals who are systematically looting it into bankruptcy. When the economy inevitably collapses, their cronies in the media will blame it all on the capitalist system that made America rich, but that progressives have corrupted beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Nothing represents our country at its best like the automobile, which symbolizes the classic American traits of freedom, mobility, virility, and industrial might. This is why liberals want to take it away and replace it with something no grown man would want to be seen in &mdash; like for example the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/07/26/spira-foam-cars-million-dollar-x-prize/">Spira4u</a>:</p>

<blockquote>[I]t's one of the more curious vehicles that have been competing for the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize, a competition to see who can design the best 100-miles-per-gallon car.</blockquote>

<p>Progressive Insurance is aptly named. Best known for running the most relentlessly irritating ad campaign on television, it is headed by George Soros wannabe <a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org/pubs/pdf/FW0505.pdf">Peter Lewis</a>, a lavish backer of all things moonbatty.</p>

<p>The Spira4u didn't win the competition, but its designers aren't giving up. They have plans to make the absurd vehicle even moonbattier:</p>

<blockquote>The car will still appear at the X Prize technology demonstration and finale on Sept. 15 in Washington, D.C., and the company is considering design changes. The chemical foam could be made from nontoxic renewable sources such as soybeans, for example.</blockquote>

<p>In Washington, a foam car made out of soybeans is bound to have a future.</p>

</p>

<p>Once again we can see our near future under liberal rule by looking to once great Britain, where white guys are <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1297421/Work-experience-FO-Not-middle-class-white-male.html">told not even to bother to apply</a>:</p>

<blockquote>William Hague was &hellip; plunged into a row over new Foreign Office rules which ban white males from gaining work experience at his department.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Foreign Secretary was challenged to explain why his official work placement schemes specifically ban white, middle-class males from applying for the &pound;367-a-week positions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the tightly-drawn rules, only women, people from ethnic minorities and the disabled are entitled to apply for a chance to work at one of the great offices of state.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The placements give students a head start in the battle to win coveted jobs in the diplomatic service and  possibly rise through the ranks to  become an ambassador. Only one category of non-minority male applicants stand a chance &mdash; those whose families are poor enough to entitle them to qualify for a full student maintenance grant.</blockquote>

<p>At least Brits still grouse about the imposition of "social justice." But unless they actually do something about it, little by little the grousing will subside, until it becomes accepted that equality of opportunity has been rejected, with able-bodied middle class Caucasian men relegated to the status of second class citizens as punishment for the achievements of others of their kind.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  7:40 AM


</p>

<p>What comes next if Obama's moratorium on offshore drilling doesn't succeed in destroying the economy of the Republican-leaning Gulf Coast? How about a ban on even transporting oil?</p>

<p><a href="http://thehayride.com/2010/07/the-obamoratorium-thread/">The Hayride</a> reports on a hearing held by the House Oversight Committee last Thursday entitled "<a href="http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5038&Itemid=2">Offshore Drilling: Will Interior's Reforms Change Its History of Failed Oversight?</a>":</p>

<blockquote>[Lafourche Parish President Charlotte] Randolph's opening speech contained a call for the immediate banning of all oil tankers in the Gulf. After all, Randolph noted, there are 11,000 tankers traversing the Gulf every year, and they all carry a million barrels of oil or more, which is an amount commensurate with the size of the BP spill. Furthermore, tankers are four times as likely to have a spill as oil wells are to have a blowout &mdash; and one main justification for the moratorium is that the feds don't have enough assets in place to deal with another spill in the Gulf (which is ridiculous given the Obama administration's track record of accepting help when it's offered). So, Randolph says, according to Obama logic it's time to ban the tankers.</blockquote>

<p>Then again, according to the oxymoronic concept of Obama logic, we may as well ban oil completely. That ought to help him achieve his stated goal of causing energy prices to "<a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2008/11/obama_admits_he.html">skyrocket</a>."</p>

<p>A Summer of Love is underway in <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100725/ap_on_en_mu/eu_germany_love_parade_deaths">Germany</a>:</p>

<blockquote>German media reported that as many as 1.4 million people showed up to the Love Parade, where a mass panic Saturday left 19 people crushed to death and 342 injured. </blockquote>

<p>The event was held in Duisburg, having been moved from Berlin due to noise and overcrowding. Attendees entered the festival through a tunnel that was closed off when the venue became full, setting off a panic.</p>

<blockquote>City officials chose not to evacuate the site, fearing it might spark more panic, and many people continued dancing, unaware of the deaths. Rescue workers carried away the injured as techno music thundered in the background.</blockquote>

<p>Groovy. Kind of like a modern Woodstock, but with a body count.</p>

<p>The ill-fated festival was grounded in moonbattery:</p>

<blockquote>The original Berlin Love Parade grew from a 1989 peace demonstration into a huge outdoor celebration of club culture that drew about 1.5 million people at its peak in 1999. But it suffered from financial problems and tensions with Berlin officials in later years, and eventually moved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to media reports, local police and firefighters expressed concerns early on about whether Duisburg was big enough to host over up to a million people or more, many of them possibly under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</blockquote>

<p>The moral: when drug-addled neo-hippies gather in large numbers, be somewhere else.</p>

Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 11:43 AM


</p>

<p>Now that our first Affirmative Action President is in charge of the auto industry, car dealerships are closed down on the basis not of profitability <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/07/race_played_role_in_obama_car.html">but of race and gender</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Decisions on which car dealerships to close as part of the auto  industry bailout &mdash; closures the Obama administration forced on General Motors and Chrysler &mdash; were based in part on race and gender, according to a <a href="http://www.sigtarp.gov/reports/audit/2010/Factors%20Affecting%20the%20Decisions%20of%20General%20Motors%20and%20Chrysler%20to%20Reduce%20Their%20Dealership%20Networks%207_19_2010.pdf">report</a> by Troubled Asset Relief Program Special Inspector General Neal M. Barofsky. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, to meet numbers forced on them by the Obama administration, General Motors and Chrysler were forced to shutter other, potentially more viable, dealerships. The livelihood of potentially tens of thousands of families was thus eliminated simply because their dealerships were not minority- or woman-owned.</blockquote>

<p>Similar discrimination is codified in the recent <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/financial-regul.html">financial reform abomination</a>.</p>

<p>Dealerships were also closed for being rural, because people in small towns have overwhelmingly resisted Obamunism from the beginning. There was no financial reason for the closings.</p>

<blockquote>[A] top Obama official, manufacturing czar and "Auto Team" leader Ron Bloom admitted that the dealerships could have been kept open, saving those jobs, "but that doing so would have been inconsistent with the President's mandate for 'shared sacrifice.'"</blockquote>

<p>Shared, that is, between white guys and rural white guys.</p>

<p>A "remediation" (i.e., brainwashing) program is what a soft tyranny has instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_101">Room 101</a>. </p>

<p>In the Missouri State case, student Emily Brooker was compelled to lobby on behalf of the morally repugnant practice of homosexual adoption. As for Eastern Michigan,</p>

<blockquote>Correspondence obtained by The Sunday Times reveals the Obama administration considered compassionate release more palatable than locking up Abdel Baset al-Megrahi in a Libyan prison.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The intervention, which has angered US relatives of those who died in the attack, was made by Richard LeBaron, deputy head of the US embassy in London, a week before Megrahi was freed in August last year on [farcical] grounds that he had terminal cancer.</blockquote>

<p>Once again, the Manchurian Moonbat insolently lied in our faces:</p>

<blockquote>The document, acquired by a well-placed US source, threatens to undermine US President Barack Obama's claim last week that all Americans were "surprised, disappointed and angry" to learn of Megrahi's release.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2009/09/obama_knew_in_a.html">We knew long ago</a> that Obama knew in advance of Megrahi's release. Now we know that he approved it.</p>

</p>

<p>From the Detroit area, the <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20100722/NEWS03/7220403/1319/Lemonade-stand-help-pours-in-from-far-away">perfect metaphor for Obamunism</a>: lowlifes stole a Mickey Mouse jewelry box and $40 in proceeds from some little girls who where trying to make an honest dollar.</p>

<blockquote>[Danielle] Behan's 9-year-old daughter, Serena Inglsbee, Serena's 8-year-old twin stepsisters, Savannah and Corrine Aldrich, and Aleyce Guerra, 6, the granddaughter of Behan's fiancé, were robbed about 3:30 p.m. as they sold lemonade.</blockquote>

<p>The kids don't have much to complain about. What's $40 compared to the mountains of debt Obama has piled on top of them?</p>

<p>At least now they're still able to make the money back by running a business. Give our rulers a few more years of ramming through an unread 2,000-page bill every couple of months and not so much as a lemonade stand will be able to operate without hiring an army of lobbyists to grease palms in the District of Criminals.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  7:51 PM


</p>

<p>According to the Nanny State, the rocks in liberal bureaucrats' heads aren't the only ones that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/21/consumer-product-safety-hazard-opinions-columnist-lenore-skenazy.html">pose a threat to children</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Michael Warring, president of American Educational Products in Fort Collins, Colo., had his shipment all ready: A school's worth of small bags, each one filled with an igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rock. Then the school canceled its order. Says Warring, "They apparently decided rocks could be harmful to children."</blockquote>

<blockquote>After all, who knows exactly what is in a piece of Mother Nature? There could be a speck of lead!</blockquote>

<blockquote>The children will study a poster of rocks instead.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And so it goes in the unbrave new world, where nothing is safe enough. It's a world brought to us by the once sane, now danger-hallucinating Consumer Product Safety Commission.</blockquote>

<p>As with most government agencies, the parasitical bureauweenies at CPSC sometimes get bored enough to pretend that their extraneous jobs actually need doing. Since terror of greedy trial lawyers has long since removed legitimately unsafe products from the marketplace, they have to stretch their imaginations ever further to find new threats &mdash; as with the cadmium menace:</p>

<blockquote>Last month McDonald's and the CPSC issued a recall of 12 million <em>Shrek 3</em> commemorative glasses because some of the paint on the cups contained trace levels of cadmium. It's good to get those off the market, right? Cadmium can cause bone softening and kidney problems, right?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Well, possibly it can &mdash; if you absorb massive amounts of it by working at a cadmium plant. But cadmium has been used in paint and jewelry for decades with no appreciable danger. "You'd have to scrape the paint off of hundreds of those glasses, and EAT it, in order for your body to even develop a measurable level of cadmium in the blood," says Jack Glass, a certified hazardous material manager. And you'd have to do it more than once. By the time your child is scraping the paint off thousands of commemorative cups &mdash; and calling it lunch &mdash; you've got bigger problems than cadmium contamination. </blockquote>

<p>If CO2, trace cadmium, and touching rocks can be regarded as deadly, it's only a matter of time until Big Government places some sort of restriction on every substance in existence.</p>

<p>Twenty-five percent of the public is still sufficiently ignorant or deranged to strongly approve of what the Manchurian Moonbat is doing to our country.

<p>As <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/may-day-paintin.html">pointed out earlier</a>, regarding the havoc Obama is wreaking on employment:</p>

<blockquote>The playbook was written by liberal demigod Franklin Roosevelt, who was able to rule as a quasi-dictator for a dozen years by maintaining a stratospheric unemployment rate. It comes down to the fundamental principle that drives all liberal domestic policy: the more helpless people feel, the more power they will cede to their rulers.</blockquote>

<p>Thank you <a href="http://zappatrust.deviantart.com/">Zappatrust</a>, who went back to 2004 to find some interesting reading that provides confirmation. From <a href="http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/FDR-s-Policies-Prolonged-Depression-5409.aspx">UCLA</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Two UCLA economists say they have figured out why the Great Depression dragged on for almost 15 years, and they blame a suspect previously thought to be beyond reproach: President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After scrutinizing Roosevelt's record for four years, Harold L. Cole and Lee E. Ohanian conclude in a new study that New Deal policies signed into law 71 years ago thwarted economic recovery for seven long years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Why the Great Depression lasted so long has always been a great mystery, and because we never really knew the reason, we have always worried whether we would have another 10- to 15-year economic slump," said Ohanian, vice chair of UCLA's Department of Economics. "We found that a relapse isn't likely unless lawmakers gum up a recovery with ill-conceived stimulus policies."</blockquote>

<p>Do ill-conceived stimulus policies remind you of anyone?</p>

<p>More on the policies of FDR and his progressive predecessor Herbert Hoover, who set the table for him just as W did for Obama, from a piece appropriately entitled <a href="http://brothersjuddblog.com/archives/2004/05/insanity_is_when_you_keep_doin_1.html">Insanity Is When You Keep Doing the Same Thing Over Again When It's Not Working</a>:</p>

<blockquote>As the state sector drained the private sector, controlling it in alarming detail, the economy continued to wallow in depression. The combined impact of Herbert Hoover's and Roosevelt's interventions meant that the market was never allowed to correct itself. Far from having gotten us out of the Depression, FDR prolonged and deepened it, and brought unnecessary suffering to millions.</blockquote>

<p>Maybe FDR and the Ivy League geniuses in his cabinet were not malevolent, but merely clueless fools. However, having put us through one Great Depression, Democrats cannot use cluelessness as an excuse for imposing another. They know what they're doing, and we know why they're doing it.</p>

<p class="posted">

</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-10317-San-Diego-County-Political-Buzz-Examiner~y2010m7d24-Los-Zetas-drug-cartel-takes-control-2-US-ranches-in-Texas">reports</a>, Los Zetas have seized control of ranches in Texas:</p>

<blockquote>In what could be deemed an act of war against the sovereign borders of the United States, Mexican drug cartels have seized control of at least two American ranches inside the U.S. territory near Laredo, Texas.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Two sources inside the Laredo Police Department confirmed the incident is unfolding and they would continue to coordinate with U.S. Border Patrol today. "We consider this an act of war," said one police officer on the ground near the scene. There is a news blackout of this incident at this time and the sources inside Laredo PD spoke on the condition of anonymity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Word broke late last night that Laredo police have requested help from the federal government regarding the incursion by the Los Zetas. It appears that the ranch owners have escaped without incident but their ranches remain in the hands of the blood thirsty cartels. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The hostile takeover of the ranches has met with silence with local and national media; however sources say they could be waiting to report the stories once the ranches are back in U.S. control.</blockquote>

<p>The story was also reported <a href="http://wvwnews.net/story.php?id=9155">here</a> and <a href="http://www.thecypresstimes.com/article/News/National_News/BREAKING_MULTIPLE_RANCHES_IN_LAREDO_TX_TAKEN_OVER_BY_LOS_ZETAS/31835">here</a>.</p>

<p>Is this really happening? Probably not (despite the <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jul/24/gunbattles-paralyze-mexican-city-across-from-texas/">upsurge in violence</a> just over the border), but what's even scarier than the heavily armed Zetas is that stories like this have become difficult to confirm or refute. We know that the Obama Regime is so hostile to the populace it rules that it has joined Mexico in suing Arizona to prevent it from defending itself from invasion. We know that the establishment media places supporting Obama far ahead of informing the public. But as for whether a blanket of silence has been thrown over a military incursion &mdash; in the short term, we can only guess.</p>

<p> In a totalitarian state, rumors supplant news. We're not there yet, but we can see it from here.</p>

<p>Statists are certainly making the most of the Shirley Sherrod farce. It was bad enough that this race-baiting Marxist apparatchik was transformed overnight into Rosa Parks II; now the liberal establishment wants to use her case as a pretext for cracking down on opposition media.</p>

<p>Try to keep your lunch down as you watch these sanctimonious Stalinists pat themselves on the back for their journalistic integrity while calling for censorship and ignoring the fact that given the <a href="http://www.commonsensejunction.com/?p=9554">full context</a> (e.g., her racial condemnation of anyone who opposes Obama's seizure of the healthcare industry), Shirley Sherrot is every bit the racist we thought from the beginning:</p>

</p>

<p>As a left-wing Senator, Hanoi John Kerry rarely encounters a tax he doesn't like &mdash; <a href="http://wbztv.com/local/john.kerry.yacht.2.1820942.html">unless it comes to paying them</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry is docking his family's new $7 million yacht in neighboring Rhode Island, allowing him to avoid paying roughly $500,000 in taxes to the cash-strapped Bay State.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>If the "Isabel" were kept at the 2008 Democratic presidential nominee's summer vacation home on Nantucket, or in Boston Harbor near his city residence, he would be liable for $437,500 in one-time sales tax.</blockquote>

<blockquote>He would also have to pay $70,000 in annual excise taxes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rhode Island repealed those taxes in 1993. That has made the state something of a nautical tax haven.</blockquote>

<p>Characteristically, the Kerry camp cannot refrain from telling insolent lies:</p>

<blockquote>Kerry spokesman David Wade said Friday the boat is being kept at Newport Shipyard not to evade taxes, but "for long-term maintenance, upkeep and charter purposes."</blockquote>

<p>Sure. Pull the other one. It's quite a boat by the way:</p>

<blockquote>The 76-foot sloop has two cabins, a pilot house fitted with a wet bar and cold wine storage, according to the Boston Herald, which first reported its Rhode Island berthing.</blockquote>

<p>His wife the Ketchup Queen must have spent a pretty penny on it. Paying the taxes too would just be too much. Fortunately, as <a href="http://www.newsmeat.com/billionaire_political_donations/Leona_Helmsley.php">Dem donor</a> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1560839/Leona-Helmsley.html">Leona Helmsley</a> liked to say, "Only little people pay taxes."</p>

<p>By the way, Jean Fran&ccedil;ois is a <a href="http://auburnjournal.com/detail/146503.html">crusader against off-shore tax havens</a>, because "while the average American plays by the rules and pays taxes, some of the biggest corporations avoid paying their fair share." Some of the biggest corporations &mdash; and some of the biggest hypocrites.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 10:31 AM


</p>

<p>You think the economy is bad now? Wait awhile: Obama isn't done "fundamentally transforming" it yet. First he spent us into a hole that it will take generations to get out of. Next, he's jacking taxes through the ceiling, snuffing out any hope of long-term economic growth. Investors Business Daily <a href="http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/541131/201007211841/The-Tax-Tsunami-On-The-Horizon.aspx">reports</a> that</p>

<blockquote>as of midnight Dec. 31, the death tax returns &mdash; at a rate of 55% on estates of $1 million or more.</blockquote>

<p>The main effects of the death tax are to destroy family farms and to prevent family businesses from being passed from one generation to the next. That's only the beginning of the taxes soon to hit us &mdash;  rich, poor, and shrinking middle class alike:</p>

<blockquote>The lowest bracket for the personal income tax, for instance, moves up 50% &mdash; to 15% from 10%. The next lowest bracket &mdash; 25% &mdash; will rise to 28%, and the old 28% bracket will be 31%. At the higher end, the 33% bracket is pushed to 36% and the 35% bracket becomes 39.6%. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The marriage penalty also makes a comeback, and the capital gains tax will jump 33% &mdash; to 20% from 15%. The tax on dividends will go all the way from 15% to 39.6% &mdash; a 164% increase.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Both the cap-gains and dividend taxes will go up further in 2013 as the health care reform adds a 3.8% Medicare levy for individuals making more than $200,000 a year and joint filers making more than $250,000. Other tax hikes include: halving the child tax credit to $500 from $1,000 and fixing the standard deduction for couples at the same level as it is for single filers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Letting the Bush cuts expire will cost taxpayers $115 billion next year alone, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and $2.6 trillion through 2020.</blockquote>

<p>Then comes a second wave of tax hikes, meant to finance the unwanted ObamaCare power grab. Tax shelters for medicine will be removed, withdrawals from health savings accounts will be taxed, drug manufacturers will be looted mercilessly, and the IRS will be empowered to disallow any tax deductions that it regards as lacking "economic substance."</p>

<p>After that comes the third wave, which will include widening the impact of the alternative minimum tax from 4 million this year to 28.5 million next year. Businesses will be gouged by withholding tax credits and radically limiting depreciation deductions. As with all Obama policies, this will raise unemployment. Tax credits will be snatched away from those trying to get an education. Those who decline to buy health insurance will be taxed brutally, as will real estate transactions.</p>

<p>Our rulers have figured out that we will not rebel before they have bled us dry. It doesn't bother them that the public wants the Bush tax cuts made permanent by a 2 to 1 margin.</p>

<p>Here's Obama lying in our faces about taxes:</p>

<div align="center"><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q8erePM8V5U&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q8erePM8V5U&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></div>

<p>To have voted for him once was foolish in the extreme. Anyone who would even consider voting for this lying kleptomaniac a second time has not only no sense, but no pride.</p>

<p>As America plunges headlong into socialism, it's getting hard to keep track of all the industries that our collectivist rulers are in the process of nationalizing. Next up &mdash; <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/will-governments-entry-small-dollar-lending-mean-bernanke-about-start-handing-out-cash-every">payday loans</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Deep in the bowels of Donk (<a href="http://libertycentral.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/dodd-frank.pdf">DOdd-fraNK Financial abomination bill</a>, whose 2315 pages nobody has read in their entirety), in Title XII: IMPROVING ACCESS TO MAINSTREAM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, section 1205 is a provision titled "Low-cost alternatives to payday loans" in which the government outlines its plans for establishing what is essentially a payday loan advance business&hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>In Section 1205, LOW-COST ALTERNATIVES TO SMALL DOLLAR LOANS we read:</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote>(a) GRANTS AUTHORIZED.&mdash;The Secretary is authorized to establish multiyear demonstration programs by means of grants, cooperative agreements, financial agency agreements, and similar contracts or undertakings, with eligible entities to provide low-cost, small loans to consumers that will provide alternatives to more costly small dollar loans.</blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>&hellip;nowhere in the text is it said the loans are  even collateralized with something like a deferred paycheck: these loans could very easily be on par or even worse than NINJA loans, in which the ability to breathe and walk at the same time is sufficient for eligibility, while the ability to actually repay never even figures in the loan officer's mind?</blockquote>

<blockquote>And lastly, what will be the penalties for delinquency and/or charge offs? Since this will come straight from the government's balance sheet (i.e. the Treasury), without bank intermediation, this will be the perfect forum for the government to lend out at any terms it desires, with the implicit understanding that it has no interest in getting paid back.</blockquote>

<p>Mortgages are already granted based on race rather than ability to pay, thanks to the <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2008/10/acorn_obama_and.html">Community Reinvestment Act, ACORN, and left-wing lawyers like Barack Hussein Obama</a>.

<p>Considering that loose lending to favored constituencies crashed the housing market in 2008, this program alone may be enough to finish Obama's work of collapsing the American economy so as to pave the way for totalitarian collectivism.</p>

<p>A few stills from <a href="http://www.goiam.org/images/articles/news/iam-news/multimedia.htm">The Decline: The Geography of a Recession</a> sum up what is being done to this country. These represent unemployment rates by county:</p>

<p>By the time this nightmare is over, the entire map will be black. If you think it's an accident, name an Obama policy that can't be expected to raise unemployment.</p>

<p>The playbook was written by liberal demigod Franklin Roosevelt, who was able to rule as a quasi-dictator for a dozen years by maintaining a stratospheric unemployment rate. It comes down to the fundamental principle that drives all liberal domestic policy: the more helpless people feel, the more power they will cede to their rulers.</p>

Obamunism has only helped Ford to the extent that it now faces less competition, since few patriots will buy from Government Motors.</p>

<p>2. B. Hussein doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt people grant him by portraying him as naive. Obama is a red diaper baby who has spent his entire life surrounded by radicals sworn to the destruction of our country and our way of life. The dupes who voted for him may have been naive, but the Manchurian Moonbat knows exactly what he's doing.</p>

</p>

<p>Whenever profligate bureauweenies are faced with the prospect of having to restrain their never-ending spending spree, they immediately lay off firemen and police. This is to convince the gullible that they actually need the fortunes they loot from us if they are to provide the basic services that justify government's existence. However, while firefighters lose their jobs as part of a political charade, fortunes continue to be <a href="http://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/13219">flushed down the toilet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The debate in Ann Arbor [Michigan, the Berkeley of the Midwest], where firefighters are being laid off due to a multimillion dollar budget deficit, is over an $850,000 piece of art.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That's how much the city has agreed to pay German artist Herbert Dreiseitl for a three-piece water sculpture that would go in front of the new police and courts building right by the City Hall.</blockquote>

</p>

<p>With SB1070 about to go into effect in defiance of the Manchurian Moonbat, the governmedia is throwing their race-baiting propaganda into overdrive. ABC News saw fit to excrete <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/hating-hispanics-arizona-ignited-firestorm-decade-simmering-tension/story?id=11179708">this</a> onto the front page the other day:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Hating Hispanics: Has Arizona Ignited Firestorm After Decade of Simmering Tension? Activists Say Immigation [sic] Law Has Given Rest of Country Free License to Discriminate Against Hispanics</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote>Jumped by three men wielding chains and bats, Adolfo pleaded with his attackers to consider his family.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"They started calling me a stupid Mexican and threatening me," the 25-year-old Staten Island, N.Y., resident said. "I tried to ignore them but they kept saying, 'You stupid Mexican, we're going to kill you.'" </blockquote>

<p>I left more than enough of my blood on New York City sidewalks before escaping that zoo. I can't imagine ABC giving a hoot, much less blaming Arizona for it. But it's different for the "oppressed":</p>

<blockquote>The country's changing demographics and ongoing struggle with immigration policy have stirred anti-Hispanic sentiment, said activists who reported anecdotal evidence that Arizona's controversial immigration law has contributed to a fresh round of discrimination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For us, there's always been a simmering anti-immigrant sentiment," said Lisa Navarrete, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, an Hispanic advocacy group. "What Arizona does, is it brings it to a whole new level."</blockquote>

<p>La Raza &mdash; "The Race" &mdash; is the Hispanic version of the KKK. Together with the propagandists at ABC who are deliberately helping the radical left distort a mild, common sense immigration law into a racial conflagration to assist Obama's race-based electoral strategy, they cluck their tongues at the evils of racism, if not for which there would be no violence in New York.</p>

<p>But liberals will lap this stuff up, and congratulate themselves for swallowing every drop without vomiting.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 10:02 AM


</p>

<p>Liberals often point to Social Security as the definitive accomplishment of collectivism in America. Sure it required their idol Franklin Roosevelt to set himself up as a dictator and steamroll over the Constitution, but it was worth it to guarantee that no one needs to take responsibility for their own retirement plans.</p>

<p>Few realize just how much money the government steals from them on behalf of this program, because employers match employee contributions, which are expropriated from your paycheck before you even see the money. This means that if you're self-employed like yours truly, you have to pay twice as much. Four times a year I am forced to send a big fat check to Washington. Social Security takes up more space in my budget than discretionary spending. What will I get for the money? According to Gallup, most people agree that the answer is <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/141449/Six-Workers-Hold-No-Hope-Receiving-Social-Security.aspx">nothing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Six in 10 Americans who have not yet retired believe they will get no Social Security benefits when they retire, more pessimistic than at any time since Gallup began asking this question in 1989. Similarly, retired Americans are now significantly more likely than they were five years ago to believe their existing Social Security benefits will eventually be cut.</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the government allows illegal aliens to collect Social Security, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2006/may/18/20060518-114132-2456r/">even for jobs obtained through false or stolen documents</a>.</p>

<p>How long will Social Security stay solvent? It's hard to say, when our rulers <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/12/social-security-health-care-reform-opinions-contributors-jagadeesh-gokhale-mark-warshawsky.html?feed=rss_home">won't let us know how bad its finances have gotten</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The Social Security's trustees' annual report is, by law, supposed to be published by April 1 [appropriately]. This year, however, the trustees have postponed its release indefinitely. The program's financial condition continues to remain hidden from public view&hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The program's cash flow has been in the red for several months as payroll tax revenues have declined because of the recession. The recession and slow economic growth are worsening Social Security's long-term finances as well, as the latest Congressional Budget Office report on the long-range federal budget outlook confirms. According to liberal folklore, the Social Security trust funds will ride in to the rescue and are capable of plugging the revenue shortfall for a long time. Unfortunately, when it comes to those trust funds, there is no "there" there; they are just accounting devices &mdash; and the call on general revenues has already begun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Given the lead times necessary to prepare the trustees' report, it is highly likely that a final draft report was readied by early March to meet the April 1 legal deadline. But the trustees' decision to table that report was clearly unopposed because Social Security currently has no confirmed public trustees. All of its current trustees are ex officio members of the Obama administration, leaving no one to register concern that delay would prevent the public from knowing how rapidly Social Security's finances are deteriorating.</blockquote>

<p>Evidently the truth they're hiding is that the Ponzi scheme is collapsing, as long predicted. If Bernie Madoff were behind this, they would add another thousand years to his sentence.</p>

</p>

<p>Do doubt we just need a little more context to see that like leftist apparatchik <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/shirley-sherrod.html">Shirley Sherrod</a>, <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/98941309.html">Ieshuh Griffin</a> too is a put-upon racial healer:</p>

<blockquote>State elections officials Wednesday narrowly rejected a Milwaukee Assembly candidate's attempt to run with the slogan "NOT the 'whiteman's bitch' " under her name on the ballot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ieshuh Griffin, an independent candidate with a history of feuds with local officials, said in response she would sue the state Government Accountability Board for infringing on her freedom of speech.</blockquote>

<p>Here's how close she came to not needing to sue:</p>

<blockquote>The board staff ruled that the statement was derogatory and should not be allowed. With one member absent, the board voted 3-2 in favor of reversing that ruling and allowing the wording. Under state law, however, four votes are needed for the board to act.</blockquote>

<p>All of the board members are Caucasian, including useful idiot Thomas Barland:</p>

<blockquote>"She says a lot in five words," Barland said of Griffin. "It wasn't pornographic. It wasn't obscene, and I didn't interpret it as racial."</blockquote>

<p>Here's why they were able to find two board members in Milwaukee who wouldn't go along with racial bomb-throwing and mild obscenities printed right on the ballots:</p>

<blockquote>Donald Downs, a free speech expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said approving the ballot language would have made it difficult to reject a hypothetical case in which a white candidate said he was not beholden to the "black man." </blockquote>

<p>Now that really would be outrageous. But Downs needn't worry. Politicians who aren't beholden to militant minorities are few and far between.</p>

<p>Regardless of how the suit turns out, Griffin has a promising career in politics ahead of her. Like the most powerful moonbat in the world, she started out as a community activist.</p>

</p>

<p>All major Obama policies &mdash; ObamaCare, Cap &amp; Trade, preventing immigration enforcement, amnesty, robbing the private sector of investment money with massive wasteful spending by the government, letting W's tax cuts expire, etc., etc. &mdash; have at least one thing in common: they are all tailor-made to drive up unemployment. But in case these grand schemes don't kill jobs quickly enough, sometimes the Manchurian Moonbat takes a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/business/19autos.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss">more direct approach</a>:</p>

<blockquote>President Obama's auto task force pressed General Motors and Chrysler  to close scores of dealerships without adequately considering the jobs that would be lost or having a firm idea of the cost savings that would be achieved, an audit of the process has concluded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The report by Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program of the Treasury Department, said both carmakers needed to shut down some underperforming dealerships. But it questioned whether the cuts should have been made so quickly, particularly during a recession. The report, released on Sunday, estimated that tens of thousands of jobs were lost as a result.</blockquote>

<p>That is, there are tens of thousands more now dependent on Big Government &mdash; and some people don't think Obama knows what he's doing.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  9:33 AM


</p>

<p><a href=http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/21/liberal-journalists-suggest-government-shut-down-fox-news/print/#ixzz0uHwlg900"">The Daily Caller</a> has released more chilling revelations from Journolist, where establishment journalists let it all hang out, believing that no one who isn't a militant moonbat can hear them. We've already learned that they <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/revealed-media.html">conspired</a> to suppress coverage of Obama's close association will the rabidly anti-American, Caucasian-hating maniac Jeremiah Wright. Now we learn that some of them want the federal government to shut down Fox News &agrave; la Hugo Chavez:</p>

<blockquote>When Howell Raines charged that the network had a conservative bias, the members of Journolist discussed whether the federal government should shut the channel down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I am genuinely scared" of Fox, wrote Guardian columnist Daniel Davies, because it "shows you that a genuinely shameless and unethical media organisation *cannot* be controlled by any form of peer pressure or self-regulation, and nor can it be successfully cold-shouldered or ostracised. In order to have even a semblance of control, you need a tough legal framework." Davies, a Brit, frequently argued the United States needed stricter libel laws. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jonathan Zasloff, a law professor at UCLA, suggested that the federal government simply yank Fox off the air. "I hate to open this can of worms," he wrote, "but is there any reason why the FCC couldn't simply pull their broadcasting permit once it expires?"</blockquote>

<p>The first reason that comes to mind is that this is America. But for the totalitarian left-wing thugs who run the establishment media, this being America is the problem they went into journalism to fix.</p>

<p>Some of the propagandists were a little squeamish about the rising level of totalitarian sentiment:</p>

<blockquote>Time's [Michael] Scherer, who had seemed to express support for increased regulation of Fox, suddenly appeared to have qualms: "Do you really want the political parties/white house picking which media operations are news operations and which are a less respectable hybrid of news and political advocacy?"</blockquote>

<p>Double kudos to Scherer, for hesitating to plunge head-first into full-blown Stalinism, and for lightening the ominous mood with some comic relief. Someone from Time Magazine &mdash; a celebrity-obsessed left-wing outlet that has fawned over Obama from the beginning &mdash; looks down his patrician nose at Fox for being a "less respectable hybrid of news and political advocacy." Bwahahaha!</p>

<blockquote>But Zasloff stuck to his position. "I think that they are doing that anyway; they leak to whom they want to for political purposes," he wrote. "If this means that some White House reporters don't get a press pass for the press secretary's daily briefing and that this means that they actually have to, you know, do some reporting and analysis instead of repeating press releases, then I'll take that risk."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Scherer seemed alarmed. "So we would have press briefings in which only media organizations that are deemed by the briefer to be acceptable are invited to attend?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>John Judis, a senior editor at the New Republic, came down on Zasloff's side, the side of censorship. "Pre-Fox," he wrote, "I'd say Scherer's questions made sense as a question of principle. Now it is only tactical."</blockquote>

<p>Back when they had total control of the message, they could afford to have principle &mdash; or to pretend to.</p>

<p>Sean Hannity says that journalism died in 2008, when the mainstream media discarded even the pretense of professionalism and objectivity for the sake of installing an unqualified, ultra-radical community organizer in the White House. Judis's words make a perfect epitaph for the headstone:</p>

<blockquote>NOW IT IS ONLY TACTICAL</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was the first council meeting since the Los Angeles Times reported July 15 that Chief Administrative Officer Robert Rizzo earns $787,637 &mdash; with annual 12 percent raises &mdash; and that Bell pays its police chief $457,000&hellip; Bell council members earn almost $100,000 for part-time work.</blockquote>

<p>Bell's bureaucrats are doing such a great job of living high on the hog while their constituents scuffle and scrape to pay their taxes, they are taking over neighboring towns:</p>

<blockquote>On July 1 Bell took control of many of the city functions of neighboring Maywood, a city whose council members voted to contract out almost all services.</blockquote>

<p>Readers may remember Maywood as a city that fell to Reconquistadors. At one point the town <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2006/03/maywood_califor.html">disbanded the traffic division</a> of the police department so that it would stop pestering undocumented Democrats over their characteristic traffic violations. Then, having squandered all the tax money, Maywood <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/our-future-mayw.html">disbanded the police department altogether</a>.</p>

<p>If only the corrupt phenomenon of skyrocketing public sector salaries were limited to areas lost to the Reconquista. <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/04/one-third-of-sa.html">One third of San Francisco employees make six figures.</a>  Under Comrade Obama, federal salaries have <a href="http://www.rightsidenews.com/200912127752/editorial/under-obamas-reign-fed-salaries-explode.html">exploded</a>. According to data compiled by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, the average federal bureaucrat makes <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/Want-to-get-rich_-Work-for-feds-92316619.html">twice as much</a> as the average taxpayer supporting him. From <a href="http://innovationandgrowth.wordpress.com/2010/05/03/public-sector-pay-outpaces-private-pay/">Mandel on Innovation and Growth</a>, based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics:</p>

<p>Adding to the outrage is the fact that unlike private sector workers, government workers tend to destroy wealth rather than create it.</p>

<p>The salary gap will keep growing under taxpayers are bled dry and the parasitical system collapses, or until we rise up and do something about it.</p>

<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/shirley-sherrod.html">Shirley Sherrod</a>, whose admitted institutional racism has earned her the coveted Pea Brain Award from <a href="http://www.ha3graphics.com/">Hugh</a>:</p>

<p>It's true that she was stuffed under the bus with Reverend Wright, Van Jones, et al. when <a href="http://biggovernment.com/abreitbart/2010/07/19/video-proof-the-naacp-awards-racism2010/">Andrew Breitbart </a> sent her videotaped confession viral. But she too perfectly personifies the bureaucracy staffing the federal behemoth not to have a brilliant future in "government service" ahead of her. Even if she doesn't land another high level position soon, her admirers can rest assured that there are zillions more just like her, getting hired every day at lavish salaries that the rest of us busily labor to pay (if we're lucky enough to have jobs).</p>

<h3 id="a014490" class="title"><a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/revealed-media.html">Revealed: Media Conspiracy to Protect Obama From Coverage of Jeremiah Wright</a></h3>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 12:33 PM


</p>

<p>CBS News alumnus Bernie Goldberg will tell you that there is no left-wing conspiracy among the mainstream media &mdash; it just happens to be made up almost entirely of moonbats who report "the news" as it appears to them while wearing their liberal blinders. I wonder what Goldberg makes of <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/20/documents-show-media-plotting-to-kill-stories-about-rev-jeremiah-wright/">new revelations</a> that the establishment media deliberately suppressed information about Obama's long and close relationship with Jeremiah Wright, who for 20 years spewed his hebephrenic hatred of Caucasians and America into B. Hussein's receptive ears:</p>

<blockquote>According to records obtained by The Daily Caller, at several points during the 2008 presidential campaign a group of liberal journalists took radical steps to protect their favored candidate. Employees of news organizations including Time, Politico, the Huffington Post, the Baltimore Sun, the Guardian, Salon and the New Republic participated in outpourings of anger over how Obama had been treated in the media, and in some cases plotted to fix the damage.</blockquote>

<p>According to these lib journalists, their colleagues were oppressing poor Barry even as they slobbered on his shoes.</p>

<blockquote>In one instance, Spencer Ackerman of the Washington Independent urged his colleagues to deflect attention from Obama's relationship with Wright by changing the subject. Pick one of Obama's conservative critics, Ackerman wrote, "Fred Barnes, Karl Rove, who cares &mdash; and call them racists."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Michael Tomasky, a writer for the Guardian, also tried to rally his fellow members of Journolist: "Listen folks &mdash; in my opinion, we all have to do what we can to kill ABC [which enraged other liberal outlets by reporting on Wright] and this idiocy in whatever venues we have. This isn't about defending Obama. This is about how the [mainstream media] kills any chance of discourse that actually serves the people."</blockquote>

<p>Let me translate, for those unfamiliar with communist lingo. When a leftist says "the people," he means "The Collectivist State."</p>

<blockquote>Thomas Schaller, a columnist for the Baltimore Sun as well as a political science professor, upped the ante from there. In a post with the subject header, "why don't we use the power of this list to do something about the debate?" Schaller proposed coordinating a "smart statement expressing disgust" at the questions Gibson and Stephanopoulos had posed to Obama.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It would create quite a stir, I bet, and be a warning against future behavior of the sort," Schaller wrote.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Tomasky approved. "YES. A thousand times yes," he exclaimed.</blockquote>

<p>In case you thought there was any meaningful distinction between the "mainstream" media and radical left outfits like the Nation:</p>

<blockquote>Chris Hayes of the Nation posted on April 29, 2008, urging his colleagues to ignore Wright. Hayes directed his message to "particularly those in the ostensible mainstream media" who were members of the list. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hayes urged his colleagues &mdash; especially the straight news reporters who were charged with covering the campaign in a neutral way &mdash; to bury the Wright scandal. "I'm not saying we should all rush en masse to defend Wright. If you don't think he's worthy of defense, don't defend him! What I'm saying is that there is no earthly reason to use our various platforms to discuss what about Wright we find objectionable," Hayes said.</blockquote>

<p>In other words, lie by silence. This tactic defines media coverage &mdash; or more accurately, the lack of it &mdash; in the age of Obama.</p>

<p>When the smoke clears and we're shifting through the rubble of our country for clues as to how Barack Hussein Obama could conceivably have been elected president when his ultra-radical background was public knowledge in advance, future historians can start with the cancer we know as the liberal media.</p>

</p>

<p>You can never be liberal enough to satisfy other liberals, as <a href="http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2010/07/nudity_and_mask-wearing_ban_pr.php">illustrated</a> by the ACLU's tiff with the moonbat mental asylum known as Boulder, Colorado.</p>

<p>First Boulder enraged Seth Brigham by enacting a nudity ban. Brigham responded in typical moonbat fashion, by taking off his clothes at a City Council meeting. The Council then escalated the conflict by proposing decorum guidelines that would require attendants at such meetings to keep their clothes on. However, they went too far by also forbidding troublemakers to wear "a mask or material of any kind that obscures the face of the person." Now the ACLU has ridden to the rescue, <a href="http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2010/07/nudity_and_mask-wearing_ban_pr.php?page=2">screeching in self-righteous ire</a> that this would "exclude women who wear a Hijab or veil for religious reasons."</p>

<p>Now that the Muslim card has been played, we can expect the City Council to roll over and submit to meetings that mix Animal House with the Gong Show. Since 9/11/01, no liberal has wanted to stand accused of oppressing the Religion of Peace.</p>

<p>Under Canada's socialized medicine, you can get <a href="http://www.encyclopediecanadienne.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0013232">faster medical attention at the veterinarian than you can at the hospital</a>. But that won't happen here. California bureauweenies are seeing to it by <a href="http://cbs13.com/local/pet.health.reform.2.1812842.html">imposing "healthcare reform" on pets</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Democratic state Assemblyman Dave Jones, who is running for state insurance commissioner in the November election, said some of the same practices being corrected by the recently enacted federal health care overhaul are used by pet insurance companies, including denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions.</blockquote>

<p>The pet insurance industry climbed aboard, narrowly averting the annihilation of their industry in our most populous state.</p>

<blockquote>Jones' bill initially sought to ban pet insurers from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. But the pet insurance industry pushed back, saying the provision would make coverage more expensive for everyone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The problem with that is that nobody would buy pet insurance until their pet gets sick," [Michael] Hemstreet [of <a href="http://www.petinsurancereview.com/">www.petinsurancereview.com</a>] said.</blockquote>

<p>Hey, I never thought of that. Someone get the word to our rulers that the same principle could apply to humans before insurance companies are <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Gap-in-health-care-laws-apf-4272209396.html?x=0&.v=1">forced to cover preexisting conditions in 2014</a>, driving insurance costs through the stratosphere.</p>

<blockquote>Stripping the provision from the bill prompted Veterinary Pet Insurance (VPI), the nation's largest pet insurer, to support the legislation.</blockquote>

<p>Once again, business leaders take a seat at the table, averting short-term disaster and probably enabling themselves to raise prices, but choosing to ignore the fact that they are still on the menu. There won't be enough regulation to satisfy liberals until the last private employer has been choked into bankruptcy.</p>

</p>

<p>Now that we have a "post-racial" presidency, the word racism is getting such heavy use that it is literally wearing out, so that people are forgetting what it means. But it still does have a meaning, representing a poison that is twisting our country against itself and eating away at the crucial concept of equality before the law. For a reminder of what racism really is, readers are referred to the rabidly racist NAACP &mdash; or for an even scarier example, the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/19/clip-shows-usda-official-admitting-withheld-help-white-farmer/">Obama Administration</a>.</p>

<p>Here Department of Agriculture's Georgia Director of Rural Development Shirley Sherrod describes to a delighted NAACP audience how she stuck it to Whitey:</p>

<div align="center"><div align="center"><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7idSlkvQv0c&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/7idSlkvQv0c&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></div></div>

<blockquote>He had to come to me for help. What he didn't know while he was taking all that time trying to show me he was superior to me was I was trying to decide just how much help I was going to give him. I was struggling with the fact that so many black people have lost their farmland and here I was faced with having to help a white person save their land &mdash; so I didn't give him the full force of what I could do.</blockquote>

<p>Having been caught on video admitting to punishing a random white guy for her own ethnic inferiority complex, Sherrod has joined the crowd under Obama's bus. But there's no reason she should have been forced to resign. Her attitude is what white liberals voted to have inflicted on their less affluent fellow Caucasians, so as to purify them of their imaginary sins against political correctness. What other attitude could you expect from the Administration of an openly racist radical leftist who made remarks like <a href="http://husaria.wordpress.com/2008/10/03/racist-content-in-obamas-dreams-from-my-father-with-page-numbers/">these</a> in a book that could be found on most liberals' coffee tables:</p>

<blockquote>That hate hadn't gone away &hellip; white people &mdash; some cruel, some ignorant, sometimes a single face, sometimes just a faceless image of a system claiming power over our lives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There were enough of us on campus to constitute a tribe, and when it came to hanging out, many of us chose to function like a tribe, staying close together, traveling in packs &hellip; It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I found solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race.</blockquote>

<p>A few more glimpses into our "post-racial" president's attitudes toward the white race that he is fixing but good by systematically destroying America:</p>

<div align="center"><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/q5XPaSSUR_Y&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/q5XPaSSUR_Y&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></div>

<p>Obama sat for 20 years in a church based on hatred of Caucasians. Not even liberals could be clueless enough not to have expected the mammoth federal bureaucracy soon to be clotted with the likes of Shirley Sherrod.

<p>It looks like the race-based strategy of siding with Mexico against his own country isn't paying off for the Manchurian Moonbat. The percentage of Arizonans who are Hispanic (<a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/04000.html">over 30%</a>) is higher than the percentage who approve of our tragicomic excuse for a president (<a href="http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_5e04d913-6975-53ae-8ac2-e26ef55339b7.html">28%</a>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rest of the country is catching up. Nationally, BHO's approval is at <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/15/fox-news-poll-obama-job-approval-think-stimulus-helped/">43% and dropping like a rock</a>.

<p>When describing B. Hussein Obama's preposterous Affirmative Action presidency, it isn't too soon to use the word <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/15/with-a-whine-and-whimper-a-presidency-splits-a-sea/">FAIL</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Repossession of homes proceeds at a record pace. The Federal Reserve projects only weaker growth and higher unemployment. The sheepish Europeans cool their schoolgirl crush on Barack Obama. Ditto the Muslims, who had expected Mr. Obama  to lead wholesale conversions to Islam, with conversion of St. Patrick's and National cathedrals to mosques soon to follow. The Pentagon warns that it can't pay its bills. The war in Afghanistan, no longer on George W.'s watch, looks headed toward Kaput City.

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  1:30 PM


</p>

<p>Obamunism is getting scary for those of us who rely on the Internet for information. After 73,000 blogs were closed down by Big Government, supposedly for copyright violations, we learn that the actual reason for the shutdown is unknown, as is the identity of the government agency imposing it. From <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20010872-261.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody">CNET</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Blogetery.com, a little-known WordPress platform used by more than 70,000 blogs, was shut down by its Web hosting company more than a week ago and nobody seems willing to say why or who is responsible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>BurstNet, the Web-hosting company, informed Blogetery's operator that service was terminated at the request of some law enforcement agency but wouldn't say which one. As for the reason, BurstNet hasn't made that clear either. In an e-mail to Blogetery's operator, BurstNet managers did say that they had little choice but to terminate service.</blockquote>

<p>We do know it wasn't ICE:</p>

<blockquote>[O]n Sunday, a spokeswoman for ICE said "while ICE's Internet piracy enforcement efforts are still very much ongoing, we were not involved with the action."</blockquote>

<p>The RIAA and MPAA &mdash; usually responsible for siccing the authorities on pirates &mdash; don't know about it either:</p>

<blockquote>A spokesman for the Recording Industry Association of America said Sunday that the trade group for the four top record labels had nothing to do with Blogetery's shut down. A spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America said he had never heard of Blogetery.</blockquote>

<p>From a later update:</p>

<blockquote>In an interview, a BurstNet spokesman declined to identify the law enforcement agency that ordered Blogetery shut down or provide the reason but did say that it had nothing to do with copyright violations. </blockquote>

<p>Apparently the shutdown was inflicted <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-41853-Homeland-Security-Examiner~y2010m7d19-Over-seventy-thousand-WordPress-blogs-disappear-overnight-but-no-one-can-say-why">without a court order</a>.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 11:31 AM


</p>

<p>Regarding how many felonies it takes to lose a teaching position in Tucson's public schools, we don't yet know if <a href="http://azstarnet.com/news/local/crime/article_292cf198-0405-56ce-9b36-0162d14283c7.html">eight is enough</a>:</p>

<blockquote>A Tucson teacher arrested last month after police say sexually explicit photos of her were found on a teen's cell phone has been indicted on eight felonies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jennifer Lynn Whiting, 32, is charged with four counts of sexual conduct with a minor, three counts of involving or using minors in drug offenses and one count of furnishing obscene or harmful items to minors.</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like she's in big trouble &mdash; but not necessarily with the school:</p>

<blockquote>Although Whiting has been offered a teaching contract for the 2010-2011 school year, the Tucson Unified School District has not yet decided if she will be allowed to return in the fall, said TUSD legal counsel Rob Ross.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ross said he plans to speak with Whiting's attorney, Dan Cooper, and hopes they can come to a resolution on how the matter will be handled before school starts.</blockquote>

<p>I'm guessing Ross will also be speaking with the all-powerful Union. If talks don't go well, they may have to bus kids to the State Pen for her class, after Whiting gets a promotion for going above and beyond to teach sex education on her own time.</p>

<p>However, if Obama's <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2009/09/safe_schools_cz.html">Safe Schools Czar</a> discovers that she didn't give equal time to homosexual depravity, she really will be in for it.</p>

</p>

<p>Just as Christians have their holy paraphernalia &mdash; the crucifix, the rosary, the aspergillum &mdash; militant atheists have their own unholy accoutrements. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/07/17/atheists-reportedly-using-hair-dryers-baptize/?test=latestnews">For example, the blow dryer:</a></p>

<blockquote>American atheists lined up to be "de-baptized" in a ritual using a hair dryer, according to a report Friday on U.S. late-night news program "Nightline."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Leading atheist Edwin Kagin blasted his fellow non-believers with the hair dryer to symbolically dry up the holy water sprinkled on their heads in days past. The styling tool was emblazoned with a label reading "Reason and Truth."</blockquote>

<p>What could be more reasonable than insisting that nihilistic ideology regarding all of creation in its infinite intricacy being some random meaningless accident that spontaneously sprang up out of nothing is the truth?</p>

<p>Pushing the envelope over the edge in typical moonbat style, Kagin declares that religious education is "child abuse." His hair dryer is intended to undo the damage inflicted by sadistic parents who baptize their children.</p>

<p>Great news for Connecticut Democrat Senate candidate Richard Blumenthal, who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/nyregion/18blumenthal.html">lies about having served in Vietnam</a> &mdash; apparently as part of a moonbat PSYOP campaign against the morale of our troops, our liberal judiciary is <a href="http://enews.earthlink.net/article/us?guid=20100716/ce0f8b7b-7850-47d3-a053-5833b5e94127">going after the Stolen Valor Act</a>:</p>

<blockquote>A law that makes it illegal to lie about being a war hero is unconstitutional because it violates free speech, a federal judge ruled Friday as he dismissed a case against a Colorado man who claimed he received two military medals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rick Glen Strandlof claimed he was an ex-Marine who was wounded in Iraq and received the Purple Heart and Silver Star, but the military had no record he ever served. He was charged with violating the Stolen Valor Act, which makes it a crime punishable by up to a year in jail to falsely claim to have won a military medal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn dismissed the case and said the law is unconstitutional, ruling the government did not show it has a compelling reason to restrict that type of statement. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The law has also been challenged in California and in a case now before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Denver attorney Christopher P. Beall, who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, said the Stolen Valor Act is fatally flawed because it doesn't require prosecutors to show anyone was harmed or defamed by the lie.</blockquote>

<p>That is, no one was harmed, other than everyone who ever earned an honor on behalf of the American military, and everyone who ever respected them for it but is left wondering which heroes are real.</p>

<p>Al Gore will be greatly relieved if this means that fraud joins abortion as a Constitutional right.</p>

</p>

<p>The Romanovs are about to get crowded right out of the history books, as Comrade Obama appoints <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=179589">yet another Czar</a>. From <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2010/jul/obama-family-cook-named-policy-adviser">Judicial Watch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>In a comical move even for a czar-happy president who has rewarded dozens of cronies with distinguished titles, the White House has named the Obama's personal Chicago cook [Sam Kass] as "<a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/blogs/yeas-and-nays/Moving-up_-White-House-chef-gets-promotion-1000158-98368599.html">Senior Policy Adviser for Healthy Food Initiatives</a>."</blockquote>

<p>Cooks carry a weighty responsibility in a White House inhabited by people who regard obesity as a national security issue.</p>

<blockquote>Because it's such a dire situation, [Michelle Obama] has convinced her husband's administration to spend $400 million a year to bring "healthy foods" to low-income neighborhoods and $10 billion to revise a decades-old federal measure that already feeds tens of millions of poor children at school for free.</blockquote>

<p>Whatever, we don't need our money anyway. Dispose of it as you will, wise rulers!</p>

<p>Kass has a big job ahead of him. The Bitter Half expects him to "change the way we think as a country." As Judicial Watch comments:</p>

<blockquote>Makes you wonder what Kass, who also doubles as a White House chef, has been putting in the Obamas' food all these years.</blockquote>

<p>How much does a cook who can change the way we think as a country get paid? Nobody knows.</p>

<blockquote>Kass's salary is excluded in the Annual Report to Congress on White House Staff because he's considered "residence staff" and those salaries don't need to be disclosed.</blockquote>

<p>In the Obamination Administration, the term for this is <em>transparency</em>.</p>

<blockquote>Air traffic at the small Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton was shut down for the presidential arrival. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter patrolled the air in anticipation of the first family's touchdown, and a pair of local fire and rescue trucks stood ready on an otherwise empty tarmac at the private air hangar.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Obamas then traveled onto Mount Desert Island in a motorcade of at least 16 vehicles. It was led by two Maine State Police cruisers and included five black Chevrolet Suburbans.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The early-morning fog quickly burned off, and the sky was bright blue for the arrival of Air Force One, which in this case was a G3 Gulf Stream.</blockquote>

<p>Now that's laying down a carbon footprint even a President can take pride in. If the global warming pseudoscience on which he's basing Cap &amp; Charade had any merit, autumn would have just been pushed back a week.</p>

<p>Some say the Obama Regime has done nothing from the beginning of the Deepwater Horizon disaster except <a href="http://www.globalwarming.org/2010/06/23/new-federal-interference-with-oil-spill-clean-up-feds-stop-louisiana-from-dredging-needed-to-create-protective-sand-berms/">get in the way</a> and exploit it as an opportunity to <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/06/ed-schultz-conf.html">extort a $20 billion slush fund</a> out of BHO's <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0510/36783.html">former friends</a> at BP. However, top Homeland Security bureauweenie Janet "Crappy Nappy" Napolitano says she was so eager to help, she even met with Alabama's Governor Barber:</p>

<div align="center"><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1qQ3wRVZZGw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1qQ3wRVZZGw&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></div>

<p>Is it my imagination, or did Big Sis instantly acquire a Southern accent for this <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/17/napolitano-we-were-here-for-alabama-all-along-gets-governors-name-wrong/">appearance</a> on Mobile's WAVH? By the way, Nappy: the Governor of Alabama is named Bob Riley. Apparently she meant Haley Barbour, the Governor of Mississippi, whom her fellow moonbat Robert Kennedy Jr. credits with <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2005/08/no_wait_it_was.html">causing Katrina</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to Nappy the Crapster's cluelessness, that was a molehill. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/transcript/napolitano-039i-don039t-think-federal-government-letting-arizona-down-now039">Here's a mountain</a> &mdash; from an interview with Greta Van Susteren:</p>

<blockquote>I'm not running from Arizona&hellip; But you cannot seal a border. You can't seal the Tucson sector. You can't seal this sector. &hellip; I don't think the federal government is letting Arizona down&hellip; My number one thought is that the people in Arizona are frustrated at the lack of action on an immigration reform bill [i.e., amnesty for criminal aliens] because I think the people in Arizona of all the states really recognize the importance of immigration reform to the overall agenda.</blockquote>

<p>No Nappy. The people of Arizona are not frustrated because you haven't yet delivered the amnesty coup de gr&acirc;ce. We're frustrated because not only will you not defend the border from foreign invasion, you won't even let us defend it. We're frustrated because your colleague, the slimy pro-terrorist sewer rat Eric Holder, is tying our hands with preposterous lawsuits. We're frustrated because you and the rest of the treasonous quislings in the White House have sold us to Mexico as part of a race-based electoral strategy.</p>

<p>They say you can't go home again. For Arizona's former Governor, this is quite true &mdash; unless she wants to get tarred and feathered.</p>

<p>No one gets lonely among the radicals now running the show from Washington; everybody dances with everybody else.</p>

<p>The same Justice Department shysters who <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-2684-Law-Enforcement-Examiner~y2010m7d9-Justice-Dept-whistleblower-ignored-by-news-media">protect the New Black Panther Party</a> have <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/62208">gone to bat for al Qaeda</a>, while the <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/new-black-panth-1.html">NBPP praises Osama bin Laden</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly the NAACP, which Obama's Bitter Half recently helped <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/naacp-tea-party-civil-rights-group-considers-resolution/story?id=11144640">whip into a lather</a>, is allied with the same NBPP that <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/obama-ward-call.html">screams publicly</a> about killing Caucasians. While they piously denounce the Tea Party on incongruous and utterly unsubstantiated charges of "racism," NAACP termites have successfully <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2010/jul/14/naacp-direct-tie-black-panthers/comments/">lobbied their friends in the Injustice Department</a> on behalf of <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/nazis-in-philly.html">King Samir Shabazz</a> et al.</p>

<p>Meanwhile CAIR &mdash; the Islamic terrorist's answer to the ACLU &mdash; <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cair-backs-naacp-resolution-on-tea-party-racism-98532894.html">supports the NAACP</a> in its absurd allegations that Tea Partiers are racists.

</p>

<p>Socialism is all about one thing: control. The ultimate control is over our stomachs. This is why Joseph Stalin used food as a weapon, confiscating enough to kill as many as 10 million in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor">Holodomor</a>. Leftist icon Mao Zedong's staggeringly incompetent totalitarian regime starved as many as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine">43 million</a> more. Under the milder (although also economically devastating) socialist dictatorship of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the government began confiscating money from some to pay others not to plant crops. In over two centuries, the most crippling blow ever inflicted on our Constitution by the statist thugs it was written to protect us against was when the 10th Amendment was effectively repealed by FDR's stooges on the Supreme Court in the <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/wickard.html">Wickard v. Filburn</a> case, which determined that the Commerce Clause enables the federal government to dictate what food you can grow on your own land for your own consumption.</p>

<p>With past as prologue, we can make sense of the Nanny State's obsession with what we eat. Even some <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/food-five-tips-for-surviving-a-raid-on-your-farm-or-food-club/">moonbats</a> are becoming alarmed, as the kid gloves come off against organic farmers who produce non&ndash;State-approved food:</p>

<blockquote>[G]overnment raids of producers, distributors, and even consumers of nutritionally dense foods appear to be happening ever more frequently. Sometimes they are meant to counter raw dairy production, other times to challenge private food organizations over whether they should be licensed as food retailers.</blockquote>

<p>Computers and large quantities of food are routinely confiscated. </p>

<blockquote>What's behind all these raids? They seem to stem from increasing concern at both the state and federal level about the spread of private food groups that have sprung up around the country in recent years &mdash; food clubs and buying groups to provide specialized local products that are generally unavailable in groceries, like grass-fed meats, pastured eggs, fermented foods, and, in some cases, raw dairy products. Because they are private and limited to consumers who sign up for membership, these groups generally avoid obtaining retail and public health licenses required of retailers that sell to the general public.</blockquote>

<p>In a December 2008 raid of a food club near Cleveland,</p>

<blockquote>armed law enforcement officers held a mother and eight young children being home-schooled at gunpoint for several hours while they searched the home and food storage areas. A legal challenge to the raid by the family is still tied up in court.</blockquote>

<p>The raid was reportedly inspired by "licensing issues."</p>

<p>Food must be licensed if petty tyrants are to dictate what and how much we eat. Also, it's helpful for them to know how much we weigh. It turns out <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/69436">there's more</a> to Comrade Obama's Porkulus abomination than a massive looting spree on behalf of his leftist cronies:</p>

<blockquote>New federal regulations issued this week stipulate that the electronic health records &mdash; that all Americans are supposed to have by 2014 under the terms of the stimulus law that President Barack Obama signed last year &mdash; must record not only the traditional measures of height and weight, but also the Body Mass Index: a measure of obesity. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The law also requires that these electronic health records be available &mdash; with appropriate security measures [yeah, wonderful] &mdash; on a national exchange.</blockquote>

<p>At this point it's all too easy to imagine an America in which your purchase at the grocery store is blocked by a government computer program that thinks you've eaten enough.</p>

<p>What other authoritarian surprises lurk in the thousands upon thousands of unread pages of heavy-handed legislation that have been rammed through by the <a href="http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2009/08/25/who-really-wrote-obamas-stimulus-bill/">radical left</a> since the Ascension of the Anointed One?

<p>The task of <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/02/the_clowardpiven_strategy_of_e.html">deliberately</a> throwing away enough of our money to drive America bankrupt so that a socialist utopia can be built on its ruins isn't as easy as you may think. Liberals have stretched their imaginations to come up with all manner of wasteful projects, ranging from gargantuan Porkulus bills down to <a href="http://radio.foxnews.com/2010/07/12/penis-pumps-for-illegals/#axzz0tpVXkShs">penis pumps for illegal aliens</a>.</p>

<blockquote>A Minnesota town is outraged over reports that an illegal immigrant was implanted with a penis pump &mdash; paid for by taxpayers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Shakopee Police Chief Jeff Tate said the expense to taxpayers was more than $50,000.</blockquote>

<p>This illustrates one of the many reasons Americans across the country side with Arizona against the new Axis of Evil &mdash; <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9GGG1G00&show_article=1">Mexico</a>/the <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/89122/aclu-sues-arizona-over-immigration-law.html">ACLU</a>/the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/06/AR2010070601928.html">Obama Administration</a>.</p>

<blockquote>[Scott County Attorney Pat] Ciliberto told county commissioners the cost of taking care of illegal immigrants in their community is skyrocketing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It should be obvious when Scott County goes from seven bookings in 2006 to 90 bookings in 2009 &mdash; that Arizona's problem is Minnesota's problem, too," he told the newspaper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to published numbers, the county spent more than $800,000 housing inmates with immigration holds &mdash; and that doesn't include medical coverage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We have no control over the southern border," he said. "We don't know who is coming in and what country they're coming from."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Regardless, local officials said they are required by federal and state laws to provide welfare to illegals &mdash; from court costs to health care &mdash; including a penis pump.</blockquote>

<p>Criminal aliens have helped California spend itself to the brink of economic collapse. If Obama has his way, they will do the same for the rest of the country, ushering in a glorious collectivist future for those who don't like capitalism but can't be bothered to immigrate to Cuba.</p>

<p>As if nearly bankrupt California didn't waste enough money, the NAACP is demanding that it make an <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2010/07/13/2885946/naacp-moves-to-make-neverland.html">official state park out of Neverland Ranch</a>, the wormhole into the Twilight Zone where the plastic surgery disaster Michael Jackson rode on a Ferris wheel and plied little boys with "Jesus juice" (aka alcohol) before molesting them.</p>

<blockquote>"I think Michael's history is world history and I think it would become the No. 1 attraction for the state parks if we could pull it off," said state NAACP President Alice Huffman, who also serves on the state Parks Commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Huffman said in addition to celebrating Jackson's contributions to music and pop culture, Neverland would join Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park as state parks honoring African Americans.</blockquote>

<p>Once again we see that with moonbats, absolutely everything is about race. But even if Jackson was black when he was born, could even the NAACP claim him as black when he died? Why would they want to? As for his contributions to pop culture, the most lasting one will be helping to mainstream pedophilia. Maybe it should be NAMBLA pushing for the park.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is so much moonbattery packed into the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1294620/Transsexual-downloaded-child-porn-escapes-jail-judge-says-appalling-experience-her.html?ITO=1490">headline</a>, you hardly need to go any further:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Transsexual Pervert Who Downloaded Child Porn Spared Jail Because Judge Says It Would Be "An Appalling Experience"</strong></blockquote>

<p>Prison would be particularly inconvenient for Laura (n&eacute;e Luke) Voyce because he "is in the middle of a sex change which means she [sic] is biologically a man but legally a woman." As a reward for having attained this state of self-degradation, he gets off with a suspended sentence and a few hours of community service. Ruled Judge Lesley Newton:</p>

<blockquote>"Frankly, you deserve to go to prison, but I can't bring myself to send you to prison, entirely because I think prison would be an appalling experience for you."</blockquote>

<p>As for whether the experiences inflicted upon the "semi-naked youngsters" who were "abused" in front of cameras for Voyce's titillation might be "appalling," Judge Newton appears not to be terribly concerned.</p>

<p>One day Britain may figuratively get its hands around the throats of the liberal elite moonbats who have been reducing the once great nation to a obscene joke. Let's hope Judge Newton finds the experience appalling.</p>

</p>

<p>How could even power-mad bureaucrats advocate socialized medicine? Don't they know that they'll need healthcare themselves one day? The answer &mdash; the death panels are for us peasants, <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/In-special-deal-charity-gives-rationing-advocate-Berwick-health-coverage-for-life-98403369.html">not for our collectivist rulers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Donald Berwick, recess-appointed by President Obama to head Medicare and Medicaid, is a well-known advocate of health care rationing and admirer of Britain's National Health Service. Rising health costs and limited resources "require decisions about who will have access to care and the extent of their coverage," Berwick wrote in 1999. Last year, he said, "The decision is not whether or not we will ration care &mdash; the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open." Of the NHS, Berwick says simply, "I love it," adding that it is "one of the great human health care endeavors on earth."</blockquote>

<blockquote>As it turns out, Berwick himself does not have to deal with the anxieties created by limited access to care and the extent of coverage. In a special benefit conferred on him by the board of directors of the Institute for Health Care Improvement, a nonprofit health care charitable organization he created and which he served as chief executive officer, Berwick and his wife will have health coverage "from retirement until death."</blockquote>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  9:54 AM


</p>

<p>If you've been wondering how the Injustice Department can justify suing Arizona for allegedly interfering with the enforcement of federal immigration law by enforcing federal immigration law, while winking at sanctuary cities that actively obstruct this law, <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/jul/14/justice-sanctuary-cities-are-no-arizona/">here's the official explanation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"There is a big difference between a state or locality saying they are not going to use their resources to enforce a federal law, as so-called sanctuary cities have done, and a state passing its own immigration policy that actively interferes with federal law," Tracy Schmaler, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., told The Washington Times.</blockquote>

<p>That is, enforcing federal law because the Feds neglect to do so is actively interfering. Creating zones where the law is openly flouted not only by illegal aliens but by government officials who refuse to cooperate with immigration authorities, on the other hand, is fine &mdash; because the quislings in DC do not want immigration law enforced.</p>

<p>Had we been defeated and occupied by Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, or the Soviet Union, America would have survived. Our rage would have smoldered until eventually we were able to throw the invaders out and reclaim our country.</p>

<p>Having been conquered from within by tapeworms like Obama and Holder is infinitely worse. They don't want to occupy America but obliterate it through massive Third World colonization.</p>

<p>Within a generation, it will be impossible to throw our liberal rulers out. Throw them out of where? America won't exist anymore. It will have been "fundamentally transformed" into some miserable hand-to-mouth socialist hellhole. A large percentage of the people who live here won't even speak English. Our nation's great traditions and history will mean nothing to them.</p>

</p>

<p>One of the most damaging provisions of ObamaCare to the private insurance industry was just announced: <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/14/preventive-care-to-come-at-no-out-of-pocket-cost/">completely free preventative care</a>.  </p>

<blockquote>From counseling for kids who struggle with their weight, to cancer screenings for their parents, preventive health care will soon be available at no out-of-pocket cost under consumer rules the Obama administration unveiled Wednesday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That means no copays, deductibles or coinsurance for people whose health insurance plans are covered by the new requirements.</blockquote>

<p>Sounds great, doesn't it? Where do I sign up?</p>

<blockquote>The Obama administration estimates that 41 million Americans will benefit initially, with the number projected to rise to 88 million by 2013. Many large company plans, which usually offer solid preventive benefits, will be exempt from the requirements for the time being.</blockquote>

<p>But at what cost? </p>

<blockquote>Better preventive care may be an investment, but it still carries an upfront cost. Premiums will go up by 1.5 percent on average, as spending for the services is spread broadly across an entire pool of insured people.</blockquote>

<p>But&hellip; if I like my current employer-provided plan, I can keep it, right? </p>

<blockquote>Large employer plans will not be affected by the new requirements if they are "grandfathered" under the health overhaul law. Lawmakers created that exception so Obama could deliver on his promise that the law would not force wholesale changes in existing insurance plans. However, as employers make changes to their plans, many stand to lose the exemption, meaning they would eventually have to comply.</blockquote>

<p>This little Trojan horse is one of several features tucked away in ObamaCare that were designed explicitly to destroy the private health care insurance industry. When that happens, we will have that which new <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/item-5-obama-ap.html">Medicare-Medicaid Czar Donald Berwick</a>  has wet dreams about every night: Britain's National Health Service. To remind: </p>

<blockquote>"I am romantic about the [British] National Health Service; I love it."  &mdash; Donald Berwick</blockquote>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">The MaryHunter</font> at  6:35 AM


</p>

<p>The hallmark of the Great Obama Recession is a business environment moping listlessly in an apprehensive, wait-and-see-mode -- that "jobless recovery" that could go "double-dip" before the year is out. Why ever could this be? Victor Davis Hanson <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/438023/the-psychology-of-recession/victor-davis-hanson?page=1">tried to pin down a businessman</a> to explain exactly what Obama has done to him that prevents him from hiring and expanding. The guy couldn't name any one thing -- only a sense of doom. Of course, the <em>one thing</em> is simply that BHO has constructed an environment of <em>fear</em> -- fear built up gradually over the last 18 months (24 months, if you count the final stretch of campaign '08) that is quite obvious if you assemble the jigsaw puzzle pieces left by The One and key players in his regime. What results is a "<a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/438023/the-psychology-of-recession/victor-davis-hanson?page=1">disturbingly coherent picture</a>" of the America to which Chairman Zero aspires. </p>

<blockquote>First, there are the appointees and their various public statements -- again, insignificant in isolation, but telling in their totality. Why would any executive hire the self-avowed Communist gadfly Van Jones as his adviser for "green" jobs? Regulation is one thing, but an interior secretary promising a "boot on the neck" of a company is quite another. Why does a labor secretary reassure, gratuitously, illegal aliens that they are not really subject to lawful enforcement of the laws?</blockquote>

<blockquote>What is California agribusiness to make of the energy secretary's prediction that Golden State farms will soon dry up and blow away? Is that a promise or a prediction? If the latter, is it lamented or welcomed? </blockquote>

<blockquote>Was not Mao the world's most lethal Communist? Why then would a White House communications director see him as an inspirational figure? </blockquote>

<blockquote>NASA historically marries private enterprise and government purpose to study and explore space; why then would President Obama direct its head to put "foremost" the use of our resources to make Muslims feel good about their scientific past? </blockquote>

<blockquote>Why ram through on a recess appointment a new health-care czar who has repeatedly warned that good health care is synonymous with redistribution of resources and wealth?</blockquote>

<p>And, of course, there is the Chairman himself.</p>

<blockquote>Second, there is Obama's own history, which suggests that his subordinates are competing in parroting the world view of the man at the top. On the campaign trail, Obama touched upon the need for "redistributive change," a desire for "skyrocketing" energy prices, and the imperative of "spreading the wealth" in a fashion that sounded like a refined version of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's crude liberationist socialism. But the reversal of the payout to Chrysler creditors, the absorption of large insolvent private companies, and the promises for intrusive cap-and-trade energy legislation only seem to confirm that the president has no understanding of the historical role of entrepreneurship and businesses in creating the sort of wealth that he takes for granted can be redistributed. Obama, past and present, seems always to talk of how someone else's money should be spent, dispersed, and redistributed, but never to worry about how it can be made in the first place. </blockquote>

<p>The third facet squelching investment in the future is fear of taxation, which is obvious alone given the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Add to that mentions -- mere mentions -- here and there of possible new FICA taxes, inheritance taxes, income tax schedules, VATs, and healthcare surcharges, and the economic picture is beyond bleak. </p>

<blockquote>It does not matter whether all or some of these [tax] proposals are merely trial balloons. They still have a depressing effect in reminding the productive classes that the government is going to take a much larger percentage of their rewards and spend it for purposes that might just make things worse still. That notion kills rather than spurs investment.</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what you'd want as President, if your over-arching aim was to utterly ruin American business -- indeed, to <em>fundamentally change America as we know it</em>. Given how utterly brilliant President Obama is (and he is no fool), his crocodile tears over job losses and reduced economic output must only mean one thing: that he is the most cruel and cynical and power-thirsty man ever elected to our nation's highest office, whose job will not be finished until he reduces the once-proud American economic machine to twisted wreckage. </p>

<p>But we all knew this, didn't we. <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/chairman-zero-i-4.html">As months of polling trends</a> appear to attest, the rest of America is finally waking up as well. </p>

<p>MSDNC Host and Lefty Talk Radio Thought Leader Ed Schultz still hasn't licked his <a href="http://radioequalizer.blogspot.com/2010/07/msnbc-host-calls-reid-ball-less.html">anger management issues</a>. He let it fly the other day, screeching that despite massive majorities in the House and Senate, and the White House... the Democrats have not yet managed to turn the USA into Cuba. </p>

<p><a href="http://radioequalizer.blogspot.com/2010/07/msnbc-host-calls-reid-ball-less.html">Here are some of his witty bon-mots</a>. First, on bi-partisanship.<br />
<blockquote>ED SCHULTZ (10:46): Do you think here in late July of 2010, after the 2008 election, almost two years, do you think the Democrats can finally get their freaking heads screwed on right and realize that the lefties put you in office TO DO SOMETHING! TO HELL WITH THE REPUBLICANS! THEY'RE ANTI-AMERICAN! THEY'RE PSYCHO TALKERS! THEY DON'T CARE!</blockquote></p>

<p>Next, Ed informs us of his views on Democracy in the context of a Constitutional Republic. <br />
<blockquote>SCHULTZ (11:51): Harry (Reid), you are ball-less! You won't do the nuke option for the American people and shove the Republicans into the ditch! SHOVE THOSE BASTARDS RIGHT INTO THE DIRTHOLE! This is about power! It's about winning! </blockquote></p>

<p>Next, Ed does what lefty talkers always accuse right-wing talkers of doing.<br />
<blockquote>SCHULTZ (13:21): And oh by the way, the stimulus package isn't working. <em><strong>That's what O'Reilly and Ingraham, those two Nazis, are saying over on Fox News.</strong></em></blockquote></p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/14/AR2010071401558.html">the Marxist Messiah continues his meltdown</a>, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/231033/ms-speaker-how-gibbs-knows-whats-going-your-districts">as November looms scarier and scarier for the Social Democrats</a>, and as Ed Schultz continues to draw about 5% of Glenn Beck's audience, expect the Chernobylling of the deranged left to become even more entertaining. </p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">The MaryHunter</font> at  4:31 AM


</p>

<p>For all of its expertise at snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, the Republican Party just might be able to capitalize this time -- really -- on the massive failure that is the Obama regime. If, cautions Jonah Goldberg, they finally appear to <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/438031/obamas-crisis-is-gops-opportunity/jonah-goldberg">stand for something</a>. </p>

<blockquote>However much blame they deserve for the economic crisis, Obama and congressional Democrats deserve the political crisis they've created for themselves. And the GOP should exploit it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For a year or so, Republicans have been the so-called party of no. Contrary to the expectations of its critics, that tactic has been good for the GOP. It seems that the tea parties, America's natural antibodies to Obamaism, have provided some vital stem-cell therapy, helping to regrow the Republican spine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But that spine is only valuable if you use it for something. Much of the GOP leadership has been content saying "no" for two reasons -- one good, one bad. When Obama was tall in the saddle and determined to exploit the economic crisis on his terms, there was no point in offering real alternatives. And it's just a lot easier to criticize than it is to lead.</blockquote>

<p>So it comes down to this: <strong>Hopeychange</strong> vs. <strong>Hope <em>for</em> Change</strong> -- that is, Hope with clear alternatives, offering real Change from the Hopeychange lie. </p>

<blockquote>Now is the time for the GOP to call Obama's bluff and offer a real choice. My personal preference would be for the leadership to embrace Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan's "road map," a sweeping, bold, and humane assault on the welfare state and our debt crisis. Doing so might come at the cost of trimming the GOP's victory margins in November, but it would provide Republicans with a real mandate to be something more than "not-Obama."</blockquote>

<p>Maybe this one time, with the Tea Party wind at their backs, our newly spined GOP leaders will learn from past recent mistakes and <em>do something</em> to reclaim our nation from socialism. Conventional wisdom is with the GOP, and conventional wisdom is a terrible thing to prove wrong when it's going your way. </p>

<p>Wait, did I say zero evidence? The moonbat propagandists at CBS News dug deep and came up with <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20010467-503544.html">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The state of Illinois -- broke, overleveraged, and still refusing to get its accounts in order -- is up to something interesting: selling bonds to meet its pension obligations. ... "States don't traditionally fund their pensions with debt," says CNN in a nice bit of understatement, "but the practice frees up other money that can be used for operations." The double whammy here is that Illinois's pensions are in trouble because it already spent the money it needed for its pension contributions in past years on other spending: Which is to say,<strong> Illinois is borrowing money it will have to repay eventually to repay the pension money it already spent to pay for other spending it couldn't afford then and can't afford now</strong>. </blockquote></p>

<p>Sounds like Obamanomics to me. </p>

<p>You wonder how Obama learned to explode a crazy $400 Billion Bush Deficit into a psychotically insane Trillion Dollar Plus deficits while achieving nothing in the way of economic stimulation? He learned from the masters. </p>

<p>It's bad news for a Senator who resembles a seedy mortician when <a href="http://www.lvrj.com/blogs/smith/Charlotte_zings_Reid_from_beyond_the_grave.html">even the dead have had enough of him</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Chances are good you never met Charlotte McCourt during her 84 years, but I'm willing to bet you'll be hearing about her in the coming days now that her obituary has taken Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to task. It's the kind of small story that has the potential to ricochet like a bullet through the campaign showdown between incumbent Reid and Republican challenger Sharron Angle.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Not because McCourt, who died July 8 after a long illness, was a political player or business powerbroker, but precisely because she was neither of those things. She was a homemaker, proud mother and grand mother and wife of 67 years to Patrick McCourt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And she was at one time a loyal supporter of Harry Reid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Her obituary, printed in Tuesday's Review-Journal, reads in part, "We believe that Mom would say she was mortified to have taken a large role in the election of Harry Reid to U.S. Congress. Let the record show Charlotte was displeased with his work. Please, in lieu of flowers, vote for another more worthy candidate."</blockquote>

<p>With any luck, a more cheerful funeral can be held soon for Reid's execrable political career.</p>

</p>

<p>Eleanor Rodham Clift --- an ultra-liberal Newsweek columnist --- (Eleanor who? Newswhat?) --- says to get back in the game and heal his plunging approval ratings, Obama needs to try something he hasn't done yet... <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/231023/eleanor-clift-recommends-unique-untried-innovative-approach-obama">blame George W. Bush for all the country's problems</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Obama hasn't done as good a job as Reagan of blaming his predecessor. Jimmy Carter for years served as the GOP's version of Herbert Hoover while Obama let George W. Bush slip away into the ether, a former president so invisible that he might as well be in a witness-protection program. </blockquote> </p>

<p>First of all, what planet is she on where Obama doesn't indict the previous administration in practically every public utterance? If Obama went through a Wendy's Drive-Thru, his order would go something like, <em>"I'd like two Big Classics, a Biggie Fry, and a Large Frostee to give me the strength I need to clean up the mess left by the previous administration."</em> And as for Bush dropping out of sight, I thought that's what all the progs wanted him to do. </p>

<p>And it's a good strategy on Bush's part. If he were to criticize Obama the way, say, Jimmy Carter and Al Gore criticized him, it would just give the media a welcome distraction from Obama's failures, corruption, and incompetence. </p>

Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  9:48 AM


</p>

<p>It's no secret why our Democrat rulers will not tolerate the enforcement of immigration law: Third World peasants, who will be the first to wind up on welfare as taxes and regulations strangle the economy, reliably vote for them. <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2009/10/naacp_registers.html">The same is true of felons</a> &mdash; fortunately for lame comedian and unhinged ultra-left blowhard Al Franken, who <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/07/12/john-lott-senator-al-franken-minnesota-felons-democrat/">rode their illegal votes into the Senate</a>:</p>

<blockquote>A new study by the Minnesota Majority found that at least 341 convicted felons in heavily Democratic Minneapolis-St. Paul who voted illegally in the 2008 Senate race. And it looks quite likely that felons gave Franken his narrow Senate victory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The six month vote recount in the Senate race was a torturous process. The morning after November 4, 2008 election, Senator Norm Coleman lead Al Franken by 725 votes. Correcting for typos cut Coleman's margin to 215, and a recount by all the counties reduced it further to 192.</blockquote> 

<blockquote>Once the state canvassing board had looked into the intent of voters and counted 953 previously rejected absentee ballots, the final total had reversed that count and handed Franken a 312 vote victory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This should not be a surprise, especially after the results of the Minnesota Majority study. With this small number of votes separating the two candidates even just hundreds of illegal voters can alter the outcome. By any measure, felons overwhelmingly vote for Democrats.</blockquote>

<p>This is because they share Democrats' moral outlook, believing in coercion and self-indulgence as devoutly as patriots believe in liberty and responsibility. They also share the Dems' economic outlook: wealth is something you let others create, then seize. This is why Bill Clinton took 93% of the felon vote in 1996.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="http://www.westernyouth.org/articles/democrats-convicted-felons-should-vote/">Democrats want to broaden the felon vote</a>, so that they won't have to cheat as much as they did in Minnesota &mdash; and can be expected to do on a massive scale in 2012, when the Community Organizer in Chief falls back on his ACORN/Black Panther base to spare him from the wrath of those voters who wish this country well and are not criminals or parasites.</p>

</p>

<p>According to Senator <strike>Granny Clampett</strike> Harry Reid,<a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2010/07/13/harry-reid-said-what/trackback/"> there are no undocumented illegal immigrants in the construction industry</a>. <br />
<blockquote>"When you go to the unemployment office there's many U.S. citizens who are unemployed construction workers and they don't have jobs because right now, some of those construction companies find it easier to hire undocumented workers," said Reporter Nathan Baca.</blockquote><blockquote>"I think that any information you have in that regard is absolutely without foundation," responded Reid.</blockquote><blockquote>But a Pew Hispanic Center study shows 17-percent of all construction workers are in the United States illegally. Reid says not in Nevada. "That may be some place, but it's not here in Nevada."</blockquote><blockquote>But their latest 2009 numbers show Nevada is the state with the highest percentage of "unauthorized immigrants" in the labor force.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>How out of touch is this guy? OK, obviously, there's a lot of Hispandering going on; the Democrat party has nothing to offer working middle-class voters, so they have to gin up the vote among the felons, the illegals, and the permanent welfare class.  (See also,<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/national/article_a2d60bcc-6be4-57af-8a86-c5dbd4f81a25.html"> the NAACP's attack on the Tea Parties</a>, exact same deal), but the idea that the construction industry isn't filled with illegal immigrant labor is so beyond absurd you begin to wonder what drugs he's on.  </p>

<p>Personally, I think he's losing his marbles because <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2010/election_2010_senate_elections/nevada/election_2010_nevada_senate">he can't believe he is still losing to Sharron Angle</a>, a woman he has spent millions trying to smear as being as dumb as Sarah Palin and as radical as Rand Paul; forgetting that both of those people are far more popular in Nevada than he is. </p>

<blockquote>Muslim parents, students and civic groups are campaigning to add two of their religious holidays to the New York City public school calendar, pinning their hopes on state lawmakers after failing to win over Mayor Michael Bloomberg to the idea.</blockquote>

<p>Among their list of benefits for adding Eid Ul-Fitr (which marks the end of Ramadan) and Eid Ul-Adha (marking the end of the hajj) on the official school holiday list? Why, it</p>

<blockquote>will help ease suspicion and reduce anti-Muslim sentiment nearly a decade after the September 11 attacks, they say.</blockquote>

<p>Add in the Ground Zero mosque, and oooh yea, these additional New York City fixtures would surely go a long way toward perking up that relationship between Islam and the rest of America and will <em>in no way</em> increase suspicion that Muslims are hell-bent on taking over the United States. </p>

<p>Yet again I reiterate <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/pat-condell-on-2.html">those words from Pat Condell</a>:</p>

<blockquote>All you Americans who've been following the Islamization of Europe from afar with horrified incredulity: if any of you are still nursing the cozy illusion that it could never happen in your country, it's time to wake up and rub those sleepy eyes, because the moment of truth has arrived.</blockquote>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 10:39 AM


</p>

<p>Prominent <a href="http://www.adl.org/special_reports/farrakhan_own_words2/farrakhan_own_words.asp">anti-Semite</a> Louis Farrakhan has sent a <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/437977/farrakhan-demands-reparations-from-jews/daniel-pipes">menacing letter</a> to prominent Jewish leaders, in which he refers to </p>

<blockquote>an undeniable record of Jewish anti-Black behavior, starting with the horror of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, plantation slavery, Jim Crow, sharecropping, the labor movement of the North and South, the unions and the misuse of our people that continues to this very moment.</blockquote>

<p>Whatever can Jews do to appease black wrath in the face of these monstrous if imaginary sins? Cough up reparations &mdash; or as Calypso Louie puts it,</p>

<blockquote>This is an offer asking you and the gentiles whom you influence to help me in the repair of my people from the damage that has been done by your ancestors to mine.</blockquote>

<p>What if Jews don't feel guilty enough to comply?</p>

<blockquote>[S]hould you choose to make our struggle to our people more difficult, then I respectfully warn you &hellip; that the more you fight and oppose me rather than help me to lift my people from their degraded state, Allah (God) and His Messiah will bring you and your people to disgrace and ruin and destroy your power and influence here and throughout the world.</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="http://www.zoa.org/sitedocuments/pressrelease_view.asp?pressreleaseID=1893">Morton Klein</a> points out,</p>

<blockquote>Louis Farrakhan's letter is not only vicious anti-Semitic nonsense but deliberately threatening. Basically, he is saying that unless American Jews cooperate with whatever scheme of "helping" his movement that he may have in mind, Jews everywhere will be endangered. This is a veiled call for violence against Jews. As such, it deserves to be repudiated and condemned. Who better &hellip; to do that than a black president who has spoken about healing racial divides, including that between Jews and African-Americans, and reducing the anti-Semitism that comes from some sectors of the African-American community?</blockquote>

<p>Here's why Obama is not such a good choice: he and Farrakhan are two peas in a pod, closely linked by Obama's spiritual mentors over a period of decades, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/374927/wright-101/stanley-kurtz">Jeremiah Wright</a> and <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=2313">Michael Pfleger</a>. Obama <a href="http://bobmccarty.com/2008/04/02/obama-organized-farrakhans-million-man-march/">helped organize</a> Farrakhan's ballyhooed Million Man March spectacle. He also shares Farrakhan's religion. The noxious blend of black supremacism and collectivist authoritarianism known as <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2008/04/barack_obigots.html">Black Liberation Theology</a> is adorned with Protestant trappings by Wright, Catholic trappings by Pfleger, and Muslim/fascist trappings by Farrakhan, but it is all one ideology. This is why Farrakhan called Obama "<a href="http://www.wnd.com/?pageId=77539">the Messiah</a>," and why Wright's church granted Farrakhan a <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2008/01/barack_obamas_c.html">lifetime achievement award</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>Politics makes for strange bedfellows, all right. In light of <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/how-the-manchur.html">appalling revelations</a> of the fraud and intimidation Obamunists used to steal the Democrat nomination from Hillary, her own supporters &mdash; left high and dry by a mainstream media that is for all intents and purposes part of the Obama machine &mdash; are appealing to patriots to get their message out. From <a href="http://hillbuzz.org/2010/07/11/great-merciful-zeus-gigi-gaston-on-fox-challenges-dnc-to-answer-for-the-voter-fraud-it-allowed-in-2008/#comments">HillBuzz</a>:</p>

<div align="center"><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ccbd4DbpS4c&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Ccbd4DbpS4c&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div>

<blockquote>Here's filmmaker Gigi Gaston on Fox &amp; Friends this morning, calling for an investigation into the fraud and voter intimidation Obama and his campaign engaged in back in 2008.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is how Obama took the nomination from Hillary Clinton, and he used these same thug tactics in the general election to intimidate voters. He will be using the same playbook in 2012 as well, unless he and the DNC are stopped.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this FOX clip, it's noted that Gaston is the granddaughter of a former Democrat governor &hellip; and she's now dedicated her life to exposing the DNC for the cesspool of corruption, fraud, and illegal activity that it is. That is the same boat all of us here are in as well: until 2008, we were all lifelong, unquestioning, party loyal Democrats who never in our lives dreamed our party would be responsible for thuggery like this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The best way we can describe the feeling we have when we think about the DNC is to remember what the human characters on the TV show "V" felt like when they saw the masks ripped off the "Visitors", revealing them to be lizard people underneath. Even people who had been helping the Visitors, and trying to convince others that they were really here to "serve the human race" in the non-cook book sense were instantly transformed into Resistance fighters when they saw what really lurked behind those masks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>So it is for many lifelong Democrats out there, including such prominent names as Lynn Forester de Rothschild as well, who will never look at the DNC the same way again &hellip; not after its mask has been ripped off so spectacularly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We need to find as many creative and engaging ways as possible to get conservatives and independents out there, who did not pay attention to the Democrat primaries in 2008, to know the story Gigi Gaston has told so well in We Will Not Be Silenced 2008.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It's the only way to stop the lizards at the DNC from doing all of this again in 2012.</blockquote>

<p>Hillary Dems tacitly acknowledge that the establishment media isn't only vociferously partisan; it is sectarian. The DNC subsidiary known as the MSM decided the Manchurian Moonbat should be President. Otherwise, his minions' dirty tricks would have been plastered across the news from the beginning. This is why Shrillary supporters are counting on conservatives and independents to spread the word on Obama's Third World tactics.</p>

<p>Apparently even authoritarian collectivists advocate clean elections when dirty tricks leave them shafted. Here's where everyone but the most fanatical Obamunists can agree: Obama's tactics in the 2012 election, after he's had four years to load the system with ACORN/New Black Panther types, are going to create a stink that will make even his prototypes Hugo Chavez and Robert Mugabe wrinkle their noses in disgust. The dinosaur media will again be complicit.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">The MaryHunter</font> at  9:43 AM


</p>

<p><em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/11/AR2010071103523.html">tried to pass this off as straight journalism</a> yesterday. It should have been placed on the OpEd page or their news blog. </p>

<blockquote>For environmentalists, the BP oil spill may be disproving the maxim that great tragedies produce great change. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Traditionally, American environmentalism wins its biggest victories after some important piece of American environment is poisoned, exterminated or set on fire. An oil spill and a burning river in 1969 led to new anti-pollution laws in the 1970s. The Exxon Valdez disaster helped create an Earth Day revival in 1990 and sparked a landmark clean-air law. </blockquote>

<blockquote>But this year, the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- and, before that, the worst coal-mining disaster in 40 years -- haven't put the same kind of drive into the debate over climate change and fossil-fuel energy. </blockquote>

<p>The disappointment just drips off of the page in this whining missive that seems to proclaim the very end of environmental activism in our time. </p>

<blockquote>The story of 2010 is not that nothing happened after the BP spill, or after the coal-mine explosion that killed 29 in West Virginia on April 5. It's that much of the reaction has focused on preventing accidents -- on tighter scrutiny of rigs and mines -- rather than broader changes in the use of oil and coal. </blockquote>

<p><em>Oh, gosh darnit y'all</em>, think those intrepid WaPo writers. If the progressives can't use the Gulf spill to push their <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/05/progressives-us.html">stupid, impractical goals</a> for replacing fossil fuels with green energy -- and heck, toss in a few dozen dead goal miners to boot -- whatever can they use? Increased oil rig and mine safety would just perpetuate the problem! </p>

</p>

<p>The Manchurian Moonbat's <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2009/02/the_clowardpiven_strategy_of_e.html">Cloward-Piven</a> economic policy is <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/39038/">working as planned</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The government's current spending trends "will destroy the country from within," said the co-chairmen of Obama's national commission on debt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Commission chairmen Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson spoke Sunday at the annual National Governor's Association meeting in Boston, Mass., reported the Washington Post.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs annually consume all federal revenue, according to the chairmen. All discretionary spending funds for year-to-year budgeting and expenses are used up on the three programs, forcing the government to borrow money to cover the rest of the government's expenses.</blockquote>

<p>This is why our Democrat rulers chose now to ram through a massive new entitlement with ObamaCare. As for the national security implications:</p>

<blockquote>"The rest of the federal government, including fighting two wars, homeland security, education, art, culture, you name it, veterans, the whole rest of the discretionary budget, is being financed by China and other countries," said Simpson.</blockquote>

<p>It's going to be hilarious, when Obama's fellow commies in mainland China invade Taiwan and snuff out its prosperous democracy. Excuse me, Wen Jiabao, can we borrow some money to fight you with? The ChiComs might as well annex Japan while they're at it. Who's going to stop them?</p>

<p>By electing Obama, we elected to reduce America to a second-rate country. This is going to create a power vacuum that will not be filled by nice people. But we'll be too busy digging through dumpsters for something to eat to worry about it.</p>

<blockquote>By 2020 the United States will be spending $2 trillion on just the interest of the national debt, said Bowles, if the United States makes no changes.</blockquote>

<p>No wonder Obama keeps poking the public in the eye on ObamaCare, illegal immigration, etc. He doesn't need to get reelected because his work is already done. In less than 2 years he has sunk us so deep into debt with massive wasteful spending that it is only a matter of time until our economy completely collapses, paving the way for his fellow radical leftists to make the inevitable transition from soft tyranny to hard tyranny.</p>

On this occasion, Condell pretty much nails all that is wrong with both Islam and the Ground Zero Mosque in one 6-minute rant. He opens:</p>

<blockquote>All you Americans who've been following the Islamization of Europe from afar with horrified incredulity: if any of you are still nursing the cozy illusion that it could never happen in your country, it's time to wake up and rub those sleepy eyes, because the moment of truth has arrived. </blockquote>

</p>

<p>It was with a glum editorial hand that The Washington Post discussed their WaPo/ABC poll, revealing that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071205453.html?hpid=topnews">6 in 10 Americans</a> think Obama is a big zero when it comes to confidence-inspiring leadership.</p>

<blockquote>Four months before midterm elections that will define the second half of his term, nearly six in 10 voters say they lack faith in the president to make the right decisions for the country, and a clear majority once again disapproves of how he is dealing with the economy. </blockquote>

<blockquote>[...]</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the issues tested in the poll, Obama's worst ratings come on his handling of the federal budget deficit, where 56 percent disapprove and 40 percent approve. He scores somewhat better on health-care reform (45 percent approve) and regulation of the financial industry (44 percent). His best marks come on his duties as commander in chief, with 55 percent approving.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obama's overall standing puts him at about the same place President Bill Clinton was in the summer of 1994, a few months before Republicans captured the House and Senate in an electoral landslide. </blockquote>

<p>Prog trolls can read on in the article about Reagan's even lower numbers at the same point in his presidency. But at least Reagan wasn't an inexperienced community organizer in moderate's clothing who campaigned on a bipartisanship lie but was hell-bent on <strike>radically transforming</strike> ruining America. You always knew where Ronaldus Magnus stood. With Obama, we have a radical, racist, anti-corporate, anti-American empty suit that barely casts a shadow on a summer day.</p>

<p>Yes, Americans have even less confidence in Congress than they do in The One, and yes, many mistrust the Republicans as much or more than the Democrats. Which, given the Tea Party resentment of the plentiful RINO herd on Capitol Hill, is unsurprising.</p>

<blockquote>About seven in 10 registered voters say they lack confidence in Democratic lawmakers and a similar proportion say so of Republican lawmakers.  </blockquote>

<p>Which makes one wonder where the Real Zero is when you really need him. <br />

</p>

<p>At last people are doing something about the nightmarishly numerous <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2006/08/moonbats_object.html">Canada geese</a> that have made parts of our country all but uninhabitable by burying every grassy surface under several inches of unclean glitch. As an added bonus, killing the geese <a href="http://www.outdoorlife.com/blogs/newshound/2010/07/remembering-our-fallen-fowl">makes moonbats sad</a>:</p>

<blockquote>On Thursday in Bend's Drake Park, Oregon a group of people gathered to mourn the euthanization of 109 Canada geese. Days before, officials had rounded up the geese and killed them by stuffing them into canisters filled with carbon dioxide. The geese  (and the large amount of poop they produced) were a nuisance in the park and month-long attempts to scare them away had failed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But some of the more sensitive Bend locals were shocked by the killings. So they organized a funeral singing songs, reading poems and saying prayers for the 109 fallen fowl.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I think a memorial like this will help people console each other," Bend resident Foster Fell told the local Bend Bulletin newspaper. "I, myself, in the last few days have been nursing a tear in my eye and a lump in my throat."</blockquote>

<p>Bwahahahaha!</p>

<p>"Euthanizing" the geese by gas chamber cost $22,000, so naturally local bureaucrats chose this option rather than allowing hunters to shoot the vermin.</p>

<blockquote>This just in: Peaceful community organizer donates box full of social justice to wife of greedy oil exec.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For those of you who don't speak MSM, let me translate: domestic terrorist maims wife of oil exec with bomb left on doorstep.</blockquote>

<p>From the <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&id=7546937">local media</a>:</p>

<blockquote>HOUSTON (KTRK) &mdash; Local and federal investigators were at a northwest Houston home Friday night where an explosion sent a woman to the hospital.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The woman was opening a package left at her doorstep in the 2100 block of Seamist Court Friday evening. She had found the shoe-sized box in front of her home about a day ago but didn't decide to open it until around 6:30pm Friday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The woman, who officials said is in her 60s, took the box to the backyard and opened it on the patio. That's when it exploded.</blockquote>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  9:34 AM


</p>

<p>As will sometimes happen, given climate's natural fluctuation, the District of Criminals has been getting socked with a hot summer. Fortunately God gave humans the smarts to adjust their environments, which they have been doing by cranking up the AC. But the Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/09/AR2010070902341_pf.html">does not approve</a>:</p>

<blockquote>In a country that's among the world's highest greenhouse-gas emitters, air conditioning is one of the worst power-guzzlers. The energy required to air-condition American homes and retail spaces has doubled since the early 1990s. Turning buildings into refrigerators burns fossil fuels, which emits greenhouse gases, which raises global temperatures, which creates a need for &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; more air-conditioning.</blockquote>

<p>That is, according to liberal ideology, you can make it be cooler by turning off the AC. Unfortunately, liberal ideology isn't much use to older people dying from the heat. But hey, they were just going to be a burden on our newly nationalized healthcare system anyway. Besides,</p>

<blockquote>A.C.'s obvious public-health benefits during severe heat waves do not justify its lavish use in everyday life for months on end. Less than half a century ago, America thrived with only the spottiest use of air conditioning.</blockquote> 

<p>A half century ago, not too many people lived here in Phoenix, which is now the fifth largest city in the country. The kind of heat that makes the Northeast screech that the world is coming to an end lasts all summer here, every summer. We're scheduled to hit <a href="http://www.accuweather.com/us/az/phoenix/85001/forecast-details.asp">114&deg;</a> again this week. Without air conditioning, Phoenix would not be possible.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, in the adolescent dreamland our liberal ruling class inhabits&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>In a world without air conditioning, a warmer, more flexible, more relaxed workplace helps make summer a time to slow down again. Three-digit temperatures prompt siestas. Code-orange days mean offices are closed. Shorter summer business hours and month-long closings &mdash; common in pre-air-conditioned America &mdash; return.</blockquote>

<p>Month-long closings: the shot in the arm our debt-crippled economy needs. As for older folks, it turns out they won't die in the heat after all:</p>

<blockquote>Rather than cowering alone in chilly home-entertainment rooms, neighbors get to know one another. Because there are more people outside, streets in high-crime areas become safer. As a result of all this, a strange thing happens: Deaths from heat decline. Elderly people no longer die alone inside sweltering apartments, too afraid to venture outside for help and too isolated to be noticed. Instead, people look out for one another during heat waves, checking in on their most vulnerable neighbors.</blockquote>

<p>The moonbats writing at WaPo are so detached from reality as to qualify as clinically insane. Yet their preposterous ideology is shared by the people running the federal government. For all we know, air conditioning has already been outlawed in a clause of the ObamaCare bill that no one has gotten around to reading yet.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  8:38 AM


</p>

<p>How surprising &mdash; buried in the bloated Barney Frank/Chris Dodd/B. Hussein Obama financial regulatory power grab are <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/11/racial-quotas-in-dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-bill/">penalties for being male and Caucasian</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The Dodd-Frank financial regulatory bill, ostensibly aimed at reforming Wall Street and preventing a future financial crisis, will impose racial and gender quotas on financial institutions if passed, according to economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 342 of the bill will establish Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion in at least 20 federal financial services agencies. These offices will be tasked with implementing "standards and procedures to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, the fair inclusion and utilization of minorities, women, and minority-owned and women-owned businesses in all business and activities of the agency at all levels, including in procurement, insurance, and all types of contracts."</blockquote>

<blockquote>So called "fair inclusion" will apply to "financial institutions, investment banking firms, mortgage banking firms, asset management firms, brokers, dealers, financial services entities, underwriters, accountants, investment consultants and providers of legal services."</blockquote>

<blockquote>The provision goes on to assert that the government will terminate contracts with institutions they deem have "failed to make a good faith effort to include minorities and women in their workforce."</blockquote>

<p>There's only one way to be sure to mollify the politically correct petty tyrants sent forth from the District of Criminals like an army of flying monkeys: quotas.</p>

<blockquote>Diana Furchtgott-Roth, former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Labor and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, spotlighted the controversial section in an article at Real Clear Markets on June 8th. She told The Daily Caller that the law amounts to a quota system.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is a radical shift in employment legislation," she said. "The law effectively changes the standard by which institutions are evaluated from anti-discrimination regulations to quotas. In order to be in compliance with the law these businesses will have to show that they have a certain percentage of women and a certain percentage of minorities."</blockquote>

<p>We picked a president based on race. How is that turning out? Liberals won't rest until every bank in the country is run like the White House.</p>

<p>Obviously hiring people because they aren't white males discriminates against white males. Having this imposed by the federal government is a blatant violation of one of the most basic principles of modern civilization: equal protection under the law. But apparently this concept doesn't apply to white men, who &mdash; with a shrinking number of ever more contemptible exceptions &mdash; don't vote for Democrats.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">The MaryHunter</font> at  5:50 PM


</p>

<p>Was there a direct connection between springing a terrorist and BP getting an extremely cozy oil drilling deal in Libya? Bret Stephens of the WSJ has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704293604575343212654162140.html">a jaw-dropping report</a> that suggests the oil giant profited immensely from the release of Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, the Lockerbie bomber.  </p>

<blockquote>Yesterday, the chairman of Libya's National Oil Co. told Zawya Dow Jones that he would urge Libya's sovereign wealth fund to buy a strategic stake in the troubled oil giant. That follows news that Libya will allow BP to begin deepwater drilling next month off Libya's coast as part of a $900 million exploration deal initially agreed upon in 2007. </blockquote>

<blockquote>[...]</blockquote>

<blockquote>This rare patch of sunshine for BP arrives almost simultaneously with reports of another sort. Over the weekend, London's Sunday Times reported that a doctor who last year diagnosed Lockerbie bomber Abdel Baset al-Megrahi with metastatic prostate cancer and gave him three months to live now thinks the former Libyan intelligence agent "could survive for 10 years or more." </blockquote>

<p>The author was interviewed by Stuart Varney on FBN.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704293604575343212654162140.html">WSJ article</a> closes: </p>

<blockquote>BP has now spent the past 11 weeks promising to make things right for everyone affected by the Gulf spill. But for the families of Pan Am Flight 103's 270 victims, things can never be made right. Nor, following Megrahi's release, will justice ever be served. The question that BP could usefully answer--and answer fully--is whether, in that denial of justice, their interests were served. It won't restore the company to honor, but it might do something to restore a measure of trust.</blockquote>

<p>Ruining BP through boycotts and <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/06/ed-schultz-conf.html">government shakedowns</a> will do nothing for BP's shareholders, let alone for victims of the Gulf oil spill. However, between jockeying for a terrorist's release, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/05/23/palin-links-bp-donations-obama-explain-gulf-spill-response/">filling candidate Obama's coffers</a>, and lobbying for energy tax hikes <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/06/item-3-no-tears.html">in alliance with pro-Cap-and-Trade forces</a>, perhaps poetic justice is long overdue.    </p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 12:45 PM


</p>

<p><a href="http://www.southtownstar.com/news/2482876,071110uofi.article">Here</a> is how close liberals have already brought us to totalitarianism:</p>

<blockquote>The University of Illinois has fired an adjunct professor who taught courses on Catholicism after a student accused the instructor of engaging in hate speech by saying he agrees with the church's teaching that homosexual sex is immoral.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The professor, Ken Howell, of Champaign, said his firing violates his academic freedom. He also lost his job at an on-campus Catholic center.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Howell, who taught Introduction to Catholicism and Modern Catholic Thought, said he was fired at the end of the spring semester after sending an e-mail explaining some Catholic beliefs to his students preparing for an exam.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Natural Moral Law says that Morality must be a response to REALITY," he wrote in the e-mail. "In other words, sexual acts are only appropriate for people who are complementary, not the same."</blockquote>

<p>In today's climate, expressing agreement with fundamental church doctrine constitutes an unforgivable thought crime. Since ours is a soft tyranny, Howell wasn't shipped to Siberia or stood up in front of a firing squad. The desired effect on freedom of thought was achieved just by destroying his career.</p>

<blockquote>"My responsibility on teaching a class on Catholicism is to teach what the Catholic Church teaches," Howell said in an interview with The News-Gazette in Champaign. "I have always made it very, very clear to my students they are never required to believe what I'm teaching and they'll never be judged on that."</blockquote>

<p>His students weren't judged &mdash; but Howell sure was.</p>

<p>There are good reasons homosexuality has been regarded as unclean throughout the world and throughout history. Religion aside, it disgusts normal people for the same reason <a href="http://www.mercksource.com/pp/us/cns/cns_hl_dorlands_split.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/two/000024153.htm#000024153">coprophagy</a> does; both are <a href="http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/homosexuality/ho0075.html">extremely bad for your health</a>. Yet our depraved rulers demand that we embrace it.</p>

<p>Since Christianity conflicts with their perverted agenda, Christianity will have to go. They don't quite have the leverage to ban it in a single stroke. So they hollow it out from inside, gradually replacing it with the vapid, shallow, degenerate ideology currently known as liberalism.</p>

<p>Next we'll learn that the <a href="http://www.biblestudy.org/question/what-does-thou-shall-not-kill-mean.html">Sixth Commandment</a> is hate speech, because it is insensitive to women who exercise their "Constitutional right" to rid themselves of inconvenient babies.</p>

</p>

<p>On Chrissy Matthews's MSDNC show... I think it's called "Tingly Balls" ... Jerry Brown, the hippie brought out of cryo-stasis to run for Governor of California (there's a <em>Futurama </em>joke in there somewhere) <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/jeff-poor/2010/07/10/governor-moonbeam-employs-tea-bagger-insult-msnbc-s-hardball">explains how he will solve California's fiscal crisis</a> (which he says is entirely the fault of Wall Street greed and has nothing whatsoever to do with the state's bloated pension system.) <br />
<blockquote>And don't just say unions are a powerful force. Hey, you know Wall Street destroyed $11 trillion worth of wealth. That's powerful. No union could do that. Then there's the tea baggers and the Chamber of Commerce. The key to democracy is leadership what can forge the common purpose. That's what I feel my entire life has prepared me to take what I learn, work with the diversion conflicting factions and get this common pathway to the future. <em><strong>Seizing the assets of California</strong></em>, which after all is still the eighth wealthiest political entity in the world.</blockquote></p>

<p>Hmmm, assets get seized usually under one of two circumstances; when creditors foreclose on deadbeats, and when Marxists seize power to redistribute the wealth. Which one is Moonbeam talking about? </p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Gregory of Yardale</font> at  9:50 AM


</p>

<p>Back in the eighties and nineties, Feminists promoted the urban legend that Super Bowl Sunday was the highest day of the year for wife-beating (or, more accurately, shack-up honey beating since married women are far less statistically susceptible to violence compared to women in unmarried sexual relationships). There was no statistical evidence for this, it was based simply on the fact that progressive women hate <strike>football </strike>anything that normal heterosexual men enjoy. The theory is that stigmatizing an activity is the first step on the path to outlawing it. </p>

<p>But since every bad progressive idea has nine lives (see Obama's use of FDR's economic policies and Jimmy Carter's foreign policy), <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/437888/the-world-cup-abuse-nightmare/christina-hoff-sommers">the feminists are bringing back the idea that major sporting events lead to violence, this time, for the Metric Football World Cup</a>.<blockquote>According to a May 25 press release by England's Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), "cases of domestic abuse increase by nearly 30% on England match days." The shocking 30 percent figure was from a study prepared and publicized by the British Home Office. Determined to stem the assaults, officials flooded pubs and the airwaves with graphic warnings. "Don't let the World Cup leave its mark on you," warned a poster  distributed by the West Yorkshire Police. It showed the bare back of a cowering woman marked by bruises, cuts, and the imprint of a man's shoe. News stories with titles such as "Women's World Cup Abuse Nightmare" informed women that the games could uncover, "for the first time, a darker side to their partner."</blockquote></p>

</div>

<p>This <a href="http://www.rickbarberforcongress.com/">Rick Barber (Alabama-2nd) campaign</a> video  entitled "Slavery" ignited a column war in <em>The Washington Post</em>. First, there was left-leaning columnist Ruth Marcus with a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/29/AR2010062903840.html?nav=emailpage">tirade against Barber's video</a>. She referred to it as "sacrilegious" and was concerned over its right wing "white-hot vehemence." (By way of contrast, perhaps Ruthie missed <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/another-word-fr.html">Samir Shabazz's most recent</a> peaceful, rainbow-filled unicorn fart.)</p>

<p>Today it was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/09/AR2010070904257.html">Rick Barber's turn to rebut Ruthie</a>. </p>

<blockquote>The ad was intentionally provocative. And it did provoke a columnist from this newspaper, Ruth Marcus. Her June 30 op-ed, "Unhinged on the right," directly and through insinuation, accused me of being delusional, insensitive, bellicose, treacherous and, worst of all, unapologetic. She broadly suggested that the rhetoric I and several other Republicans are using could lead to violence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Though I'm not a veteran of politics, I've come to understand that arguments, and thus governments, move most often through fear. </blockquote>

<blockquote>[...]</blockquote>

<blockquote>Over the past 18 months, the federal government has sought to seize or has seized control of the health-care industry, the financial industry, the mortgage industry, the automobile industry, student loans, broadband Internet and the energy sector through cap-and-trade legislation. With never a crisis going to waste, each new seizure is rationalized by some new emergency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Obama administration has inflated our money supply by more than 120 percent, refused to connect the dots between self-proclaimed jihadists and Islam and done nothing to secure our borders, all the while insisting that more government is the answer to our nation's problems.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I take Barack Obama at his word that he wants to fundamentally transform America. His actions, words and policy suggest that he doesn't much care for the free market or our American heritage. I am one who doesn't believe that America needs fundamental transformation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The "Slavery" ad is a metaphor for our shrinking individual liberty. </blockquote>

<p>Responding to Marcus' accusations of "fear mongering" from the right: </p>

<blockquote>The frenzied "bellicose talk" from the Tea Parties has been going on for more than a year, yet I can't think of a single incident that has led to violence. As for the connection between talk radio and violence, with a little research Marcus would have learned that Glenn Beck didn't like my ads. I suspect that liberals will continue to make that argument because they despise freedom of speech when the speech is conservative. </blockquote>

<p>Mr. Barber reveals Marcus as a hypocritical fool. She accuses him of fear-mongering while using her own brand of outlandish, fear-mongering hyperbole throughout her column. She even employs a "slippery slope" argument after accusing Barber of doing the same. Barber's is an exemplary rebuttal, tearing down his opponent's position while simultaneously reinforcing his own. </p>

<p>Alabama's Rick Barber is a Tea Party candidate in pure form. He resigned his commission in the Marines about 11 years ago, started a family and some moderately successful businesses in the Montgomery area, and then became sickened at what he saw not only Democrats but RINOs doing to our nation. His campaign is fueled on love of family, country, and the Constitution. If he happens to be saying things in his ads that threaten people (and even Glenn Beck), then so be it. We need more Rick Barbers as congressional candidates. He's not merely hoping for change in 2010, <a href="http://www.rickbarberforcongress.com/">he is fighting for it</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Political terrorism. Achievements: the death of 2,976 Americans in NYC on 9/11, and many other deaths in London, Madrid, Bali, India, and Iraq. Motive: anger at America's interference in the Middle East, including US backing of Israel against Palestinians and support of repressive Arab regimes, and US wars against Islamic states. Main agent of terrorism: Al Qaeda. Weapons: airplanes, suicide bombs, car bombs, IEDs, websites.</blockquote><blockquote>Financial terrorism. Achievements: Loss of 100 million jobs worldwide. Millions suffering from food insecurity. Wrecked economies. Many small business closings. A great loss of family homes. Motive: profit. Main agent of terrorism: Goldman Sachs. Weapons: speculative bubbles, debt securitization, unsafe derivatives, campaign contributions, regulatory capture, bad mortgages.</blockquote><blockquote>Environmental terrorism. Achievements: Bhopal, Exxon Valdez oil spill, Nigerian oil spills, Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Motive: profit. Main agent of terrorism: BP. Weapons: unsafe drilling practices, indifference to worker safety, 1960s clean-up technology, useless contingency plans, campaign contributions, takeover of regulatory agencies, misinformation about climate change, managerial indifference to risk and the environment.</blockquote>

<p>It's funny --- not "ha-ha" funny  but "locked away in a rubber room and not allowed to eat with utensils" funny --- that the progressive left has latched onto this fantasy that from 2000 to 2008, there was absolutely no regulation of business or commerce. Can anyone, seriously, name any industry that was deregulated under the Bush Regime? Goldman Sachs isn't even really a free market entity. It's the beneficiary of the crony corporatism practiced by governments under both parties. </p>

<p>Anyway, it's all the basic progressive-crazee boilerplate: America sucks, FoxNews is evil, Tea Partiers are dangerous, jail the bankers, fight terrorism with lawsuits, nationalize health care, and "regulate, regulate, regulate."  And, of course, Obama is Teh Grate Messiah<br />
<blockquote>Obama met with BP and got them to agree to put up the money for a no-cap $20 billion escrow fund, run by an independent third party, and another extra $100 million set aside for oil workers who are unemployed because of the moratorium, and the billions in dividends they were going to pay their shareholders will now be withheld for the next three quarters.... I think it's the best thing I've seen a president do since Kennedy faced down the Russians in the Cuban Missile Crisis. It's better than anything Carter, Reagan, the Bushes and Clinton did put together.</blockquote></p>

<p>So, Obama shaking down BP > Reagan defeating the Soviet Empire. (And Kennedy didn't stare down the Soviets, he knuckled under and agreed to pull US missiles out of Turkey, which is what the Soviets wanted all along. And he sentenced millions of Cubans to life in a perpetual, nationwide gulag. Which, I guess, to a leftist, is a heroic accomplishment). </p>

<p>The nutjob also hypothesizes that Obama blackmailed BP into coughing up the $20 Billion by threatening to nationalize them. A few sentences later, he attacks Republicans for calling what Obama did a "shakedown." Um, if Obama got money out of BP by threatening them, in what way is that not a shakedown? </p>

<p> It's amazing that anyone over the age of 15 believes this crap, but many do. And they are running the American Government. </p>

</p>

<p>You don't need to be a psychiatrist to see how narcissistic President Obama is, but Dr. Charles Krauthammer certainly puts it into context. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/08/AR2010070804277.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">This fine column</a> discusses the America Last mentality as exemplified by Chmn. Zero's foreign policy losses and his new and insulting mission for NASA. But what caught my attention were these insights into <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/08/AR2010070804277.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">Dear Leader's profound ego</a>. </p>

<blockquote>It began with the almost comical self-inflation of his presidential campaign, from the still inexplicable mass rally in Berlin in front of a Prussian victory column to the Greek columns framing him at the Democratic convention. And it carried into his presidency, from his posture of philosopher-king adjudicating between America's sins and the world's to his speeches marked by a spectacularly promiscuous use of the word "I."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Notice, too, how Obama habitually refers to Cabinet members and other high government officials as "<strong>my</strong>" -- "<strong>my</strong> secretary of homeland security," "<strong>my</strong> national security team," "<strong>my</strong> ambassador." The more normal -- and respectful -- usage is to say "the," as in "the secretary of state." These are, after all, public officials sworn to serve the nation and the Constitution -- not just the man who appointed them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It's a stylistic detail, but quite revealing of Obama's exalted view of himself. Not surprising, perhaps, in a man whose major achievement before acceding to the presidency was writing two biographies -- both about himself. </blockquote>

<p>It's astounding to have an American president who can be at once so self-absorbed (indeed, nothing new in a president) but also so disrespectful and negative about his own country. </p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 10:09 AM


</p>

<p>Even in San Fransicko, liberty and sanity sometimes win out over liberalism. A proposal to make it illegal to sell any pets other than fish has been <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_15476512">tabled</a> due to public outrage. But in light of the rust-like tenacity of liberalism, it wouldn't be surprising if Commissioner Phillip Gerrie and other <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/08/BAKI1EBLPK.DTL">moonbats</a> try again in the future.</p>

<blockquote>Gerrie expressed concerns about how many "smalls," little pets like hamsters and gerbils, are euthanized each year because pet owners don't realize that the cute little critters can be a noisy, destructive handful. Gerrie seemed to be coming very close to what some critics have charged - that the real goal is to discourage locals from owning pets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When," he asked, "do we stop the exploiting, the buying and selling of animals?"</blockquote>

<p>There you have it: a liberal admits to the objective of bringing the human race back to a point prior to the domestication of animals. As for the put-upon gerbils: what effect will banning pet stores have on the gerbil population?</p>

<blockquote>But most of the early speakers were more focused on caged tropical birds. Mira Tweti, the believe-it-or-not-named author of "Of Parrots and People," had a PowerPoint presentation about captive parrots and the tribulations they must endure. And a representative from In Defense of Animals called for a ban on breeding, selling and keeping birds - unless the person is rescuing the bird from an abusive home.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And while it was admittedly wrenching testimony, the average pet owner probably wanted to know if he or she would be able to buy a puppy at a local pet store. As commission Chairwoman Stephanie Stephens said, no one wants to see an animal mistreated, but what about the responsible pet owner who keeps an animal in good condition and forms a mutual bond of trust and affection?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nope, testified the bird advocate, they shouldn't have a pet either.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In a town where it is often said that dogs outnumber children, that's going to be a tough sell.</blockquote>

<p>That probably explains why this latest moonbat power grab failed for the time being; in Liberal Land, the affection that would have gone toward aborted babies is redirected to yapping lapdogs with ribbons on their heads.</p>

<p>In this day and age, there are some things a pastor just can't expect to get away with &mdash; for example, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/07/09/pastor-yanked-capitol-jesus-prayer/?test=latestnews">invoking the name of Jesus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>A North Carolina pastor was relieved of his duties as an honorary chaplain of the state house of representatives after he closed a prayer by invoking the name of Jesus.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I got fired," said Ron Baity, pastor of Berean Baptist Church in Winston-Salem. He had been invited to lead prayer for an entire week but his tenure was cut short when he refused to remove the name Jesus from his invocation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Baity's troubles began during the week of May 31. He said a House clerk asked to see his prayer. The invocation including prayers for our military, state lawmakers and a petition to God asking him to bless North Carolina."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When I handed it to the lady, I watched her eyes and they immediately went right to the bottom of the page and the word Jesus," he told FOX News Radio. "She said 'We would prefer that you not use the name Jesus. We have some people here that can be offended.'"</blockquote>

<p>If Baity ventured into hell to pray for the demons there he would get the same reaction &mdash; and for the same reason.</p>

<p>He should have made it easy on himself by changing the reference to "the Savior Whose Enemies Prefer He Not Be Named." Or if he wanted to get invited back by the bureaudemons, he could have substituted a certain bloodthirsty 6th century Arabian warlord for Jesus.</p>

<p>Given that our legal system has been completely deranged by moonbattery, see if you can guess how it responded to <a href="http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-theives-free-victim-arrested-txt,0,231586.story">this case</a> from Wheat Ridge, Colorado:</p>

<blockquote>82-year-old Robert Wallace said in February that he looked out his window and saw two men hooking his flatbed trailer up to their pickup. He yelled at them to stop, but they sped away, stealing his trailer. He told police he fired two shots at the pickup.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Minutes later, police say 32-year-old Damacio Torres dropped 28-year-old Alvaro Cardona off at a hospital emergency room with a gunshot wound to the face.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Torres did not stay to talk with police, but they caught up with him later. According to court documents, he admitted he and Cardona stole the trailer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wallace did not want to talk on camera, but when we asked him if the two men threatened him he said, "They almost ran me over."</blockquote>

<p>Now the crooks &mdash; both illegal aliens with arrest records, one of whom was under investigation for taking part in a major auto theft ring &mdash; are safely behind bars on their way to getting deported, right? Of course not:</p>

<blockquote>The Jefferson County DA's office said that neither Torres nor Cardona have been charged with anything at this point, even though Torres confessed to the crime. However, the homeowner, Wallace is facing twelve felony counts, including four counts of attempted first degree murder. If convicted, he could spend the rest of his life behind bars.</blockquote>

<p>Since they believe in a criminal ideology of theft and coercion (aka "spreading the wealth around"), the liberals who run our courts and our government are criminals. It's hardly surprising that they look out for their own at the expense of their enemy, the respectable citizen.</p>

</p>

<p>The progressive left claims anyone who sees Obama --- redistributer of wealth and nationalizer of student loans, car companies, banks, and health care --- as a socialist is some kind of nutty dangerous whackjob. </p>

<p>Apparently, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/230874/55-percent-likely-voters-find-socialist-accurate-label-obama">55% of likely voters are nutty dangerous whackjobs</a>. <br />
<blockquote>When asked about "a socialist," 33 percent of likely voters say it describes Obama "very well," 22 percent say "well," 15 percent say "not too well," and 25 percent say "not well at all." </blockquote></p>

<p>I guess it depends on how you define socialism. Some people will hang up on the dictionary definition and claim it is only <em>really </em>socialism when the Government outright claims ownership of industry. But if Government --- as the Obamacrats are striving to do --- seeks absolute regulation of industry, telling industry what it may produce, how much it may charge, who it may hire, how much it must pay them, what business activities it may engage in, how much profit it is allowed to make... at that point, it is just a matter of semantics and legal formalities. </p>

<p>Apart from the lunatic libertarian/anarchist fringe, most people are okay with some role of Government in society, but by and large, most people do not want to be micromanaged by bureaucrats. And those who do are... well... dangerous and nutty. </p>

<p>Economist Art Laffer points out something that should be "Well, duh" to anyone who doesn't have his head firmly planted in his proctological region: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704862404575351301788376276.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop">It's not an economic stimulus if the Government is paying people to do nothing</a>. <br />
<blockquote>The idea that higher unemployment benefits won't lead to more unemployment doesn't make much sense. Imagine what the unemployment rate would look like if unemployment benefits were universally $150,000 per year. My guess is we'd have a heck of a lot more unemployment.</blockquote></p>

<p>Laffer believes that a temporary suspension in Federal Taxes would have provided more economic activity than the "Stimulus" did. <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2010/07/08/laffer-taxes/">His common sense analysis has led the left to denounce him as a kook</a>. But remember, these are the same people who think the way to ease our dependence on foreign oil is to make it illegal to drill for any oil domestically. Look at your total Federal Withholding, and imagine that was income for six months. I bet you could do some serious economic stimulatin' with it. </p>

</p>

<p>Since mid-June, a concerted effort has been underway in the House of Representatives  to dispatch with ObamaCare using a <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/111/lrc/pd/petitions/Dis11.htm">discharge petition</a>. Which means, there is actually hope for <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=176077">change</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Congressional officials said Pelosi, an adamant advocate for government-controlled health care, never would allow a vote on a plan to overturn Obamacare. But through the discharge petition process in the House, if a majority of members sign on, she cannot stop it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fact that support is required from 218 members also means any plan thus endorsed likely would pass the 435-member House.</blockquote>

<p>If 109 more congressfolk sign, not even Nasty Pelousy could prevent a new vote. With public sentiment resoundingly against ObamaCare, who knows -- maybe representatives would actually vote to represent their constituents -- this being a contentious election year and all, with Democrats rather much on the short end of things.  </p>

<p>Check to see if your representative has signed onto the resolution <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=176077">here</a>. If they're not on the list, <a href="http://www.house.gov/">then call</a>. </p>

<p>According to the Obama Regime, Arizona is interfering with the enforcement of federal immigration law by enforcing it when the federal government won't. Meanwhile, liberal sanctuary cities deliberately flout that same law, and defiantly refuse to cooperate with federal authorities, with Comrade Obama's tacit approval. Not even the lamest excuse is offered as justification for this outrageous state of affairs.</p>

<p>The obvious has become impossible to deny: our Democrat rulers do not want immigration law enforced. Why? Because the hostile colonization of large parts of the USA by the dregs of the Third World is key to their demographic strategy for maintaining power. They are traitors.</p>

<p>Illinois has been on the cutting edge of politics lately. First it gave us the Manchurian Moonbat, who installed Chicago-style politics in the White House and promptly ran up a gargantuan deficit by shoveling mountains of our money at preposterous pork projects. Now Illinois has <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2010/07/07/illinois-shrugs-paying-bills/">revealed</a> how such massive debts can be dealt with: </p>

<blockquote>The state of Illinois is more than $5 billion dollars in debt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Land of Lincoln is giving California a run for its money at becoming the most fiscally unstable state.</blockquote>

<blockquote>So Illinois' answer?  Just stop paying the bills and see what happens!</blockquote>

<blockquote>That's not a joke &mdash; that's what they're doing!</blockquote>

<p>Times are tough in Illinois &mdash; unless you're a bureaucrat. Deep down at the bottom of a sea of red ink, Democrat Governor Pat Quinn has been handing out raises to his employees.</p>

<blockquote>Here are the numbers:  the Democrat leader has given 43 salary increases &mdash; averaging 11.5%  to 35 staffers in the past 15 months, according to the Associated Press.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ironically, the state's budget director, David Vaught,  made out the best &mdash; he got a 20% raise or $24,000!</blockquote>

<blockquote>And the deputy budget director &mdash; Gladyse Taylor &mdash; got a  10.5% bump!</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, outside the hallowed halls of government:</p>

<blockquote>The unemployment rate for the state nears 11% and the state ranks in the top five of states with the most foreclosures.</blockquote>

</p>

<p>This generation has already been bled dry by our moonbat rulers, who are now working on our descendants by running up a deficit that it may take a century to pay down. But at least we're getting a stimulated economy in return. For example, the "Dance Draw" program at University of North Carolina at Charlotte created nearly two jobs thanks to <a href="http://www.wcnc.com/news/local/Dancing-Stimulus-Project-Has-Critics-97677354.html">lavish federal financing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Dance Draw won more than $750,000 in federal stimulus money. &hellip; Dance Draw drew fire because of the number of jobs it reportedly created, one and a half.</blockquote>

<p>What exactly does "Dance Draw" entail?</p>

<blockquote>UNCC dance students wear wireless computer mice on their chests and wrists to "draw" abstract geometric shapes on a computer screen.</blockquote>

<p>Here's an idea: why not pay dance students to sing the theme song from Gilligan's Island while standing on their heads? Considering that no wireless mice would be required, the government ought to be able to fund this for as little as $749,900 &mdash; a small price to pay for another one and a half jobs.</p>

<p>No, this isn't another verbal gaffe from Chairman Zero about his dislike for our men and women in uniform. This is a fascinating look into how far European moonbat ecoturds will go in dehumanizing our society in order to feel like they have saved the planet. Take, for example, <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/lifestyle/the-other-side/dead-put-in-dunny/story-e6frfhk6-1225889434108">those pesky dead bodies</a> one has to deal with, after all the funeral weeping is over. </p>

<blockquote>Undertakers could dissolve corpses in chemicals then flush the remains into the sewage system under plans being studied by European bureaucrats.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The controversial method has been hailed as a much more ecologically sound method of dealing with the dead.</blockquote>

<p>It's called "chemical hydrolysis" and it's a proven method, used on cattle infected with mad cow disease. Here's a description: </p>

<blockquote>The body is placed in a silk bag, itself placed within a metal cage frame. This is then loaded into a Resomator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The machine is filled with a mixture of water and potassium hydroxide, and set to 180C.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The end result is a small quantity of green-brown liquid containing amino acids, peptides, sugars and salts.</blockquote>

<p>Your loved one's body-temple on earth, relegated to greenish brown goo? Not entirely:</p>

<blockquote>Soft, porous white bone remains are easily crushed, and can then be returned to the next of kin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The liquid can be recycled back to the ecosystem by being applied to a memorial garden or forest or simply put into the sewage system.</blockquote>

<p>Have no fear, Modern Science is here to save the planet AND eviscerate our society of one of its most prized pillars: sincere respect for the dead. Even cremation and scattering offers more honor to one's memory than does a dark-green flush into a damp sewer. But to moonbats who would save a baby seal before saving a human being in its mother's womb, this is just a natural societal progression.</p>

<p>When police pull someone over in Rhode Island and have reasonable cause to believe he's an illegal alien, <a href="http://legalinsurrection.blogspot.com/2010/07/hey-rhode-island-already-checks.html">they check his immigration status</a>. The policy is virtually identical to the Arizona law, and yet the Justice Department is not suing to stop it. What gives? Is the Rhode Island program run by the Black Panthers or something? </p>

<p>For that matter, I haven't heard of any boycotts targeting Rhode Island either. So why is Arizona being singled out? Here's a theory: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODZkOGRlMTNjZTFhOWVhNjM2M2FkMzc4YTNkM2M0ZjI=">Maybe it's because Arizona seems serious about enforcing it</a>: <br />
<blockquote>(Eric) Holder is worried that trained and knowledgeable local cops will actually prove that the law is enforceable, blowing his boss's cover. Remember President Barack Obama's claim last week that our borders are "just too vast" for us to secure them through enforcement, with fences and border patrols?</blockquote></p>

<p>Couple the possibility of blowing away the myth that immigration law is unenforceable with the Democrats desperate need to mobilize Hispanic voters for the mid-terms, and you can understand why Bammy is hellbent on pursuing this crazy lawsuit. </p>

<p>What do you get when you mix a Palestinian baby with a rare immune system disorder, generous Israeli donors, talented Israeli doctors, and a radical militant Palestinian mother? <a href="http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2010/07/mother-of-baby-saved-by-israelis-wants.html">Murderous intentions</a>. </p>

<p>As reported by <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/saving-mohammed-abu-mustafa-1.299481?trailingPath=2.169,2.212,2.213,">Haaretz.com</a>, 4.5-month-old Mohammed Abu Mustafa was unlikely to survive his genetic fate. A potentially life-saving bone marrow transplant was financially out of the question. But then some generous Israeli Jews stepped in. </p>

<blockquote>Hours after the news item about Mohammed was broadcast, the hospital switchboard was jammed with callers. An Israeli Jew whose son died during his military service donated $55,000, and for the first time the Abu Mustafa family began to feel hopeful. </blockquote>

<p>However, as push came to shove, TV reporter Shlomi Eldar, who was interviewing little Mohammed's mother, tapped into just about the deepest kind of hatred imaginable between peoples. </p>

<blockquote>[...] From an innocent conversation about religious holidays, Raida Abu Mustafa launched into a painful monologue about the culture of the shahids - the martyrs - and admitted, during the complex transplant process, that she would like to see her son perpetrate a suicide bombing attack in Jerusalem.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jerusalem is ours," she declared. "We are all for Jerusalem, the whole nation, not just a million, all of us. Do you understand what that means - all of us?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>She also explained to Eldar exactly what she had in mind. "For us, death is a natural thing. We are not frightened of death. From the smallest infant, even smaller than Mohammed, to the oldest person, we will all sacrifice ourselves for the sake of Jerusalem. We feel we have the right to it. You're free to be angry, so be angry."</blockquote>

<p><strong>In short: </strong>the mother of this little baby -- whose life was saved by the generosity of Israelis -- wants him to grow up big and strong so he can kill himself while murdering lots of Israelis. </p>

<p>Octavia Nasr used to be CNN's Senior Editor of Mideast Affairs. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2010/07/07/2010-07-07_cnn_fires_octavia_nasr_for_twitter_post_praising_hezbollah_terrorist_says_credib.html#ixzz0t2vBpsR7">Not anymore</a>. </p>

<blockquote>Less than 140 characters cost CNN's Octavia Nasr her job after she tweeted her "respect" for a terror-loving Hezbollah  sheikh who died over the weekend.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nasr, CNN's Senior Editor of Mideast Affairs, ran into hot water after she posted on Twitter that she was "sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah... One of Hezbollah's giants I respect a lot."</blockquote>

<p>Terrorist admirer Nasr understands that she shouldn't have praised Fadlallah -- who rabidly hated America and praised suicide bombings killing Israeli students -- without proper "context." Whatever "context" might that be? Warning Muslim men not to abuse their wives? Backpedaling got her nowhere, however, since CNN higher-ups realized she'd inevitably be forced to reveal those other "Hezbollah giants" whom she reveres. </p>

<p>Never fear, Ms. Nasr. You will be right in line for a gig with MSNBC, right after <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/06/dave-weigel-lan.html">David Weigel</a> gets settled in. </p>

<blockquote>Defence lawyer Ruben Morales said the judges and prosecutors were criminalizing Davis' beliefs and violating his right to religious expression.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The state's attempt to place (Davis) in a bad light with the jury was nothing less than a 'witch hunt.' This is precisely the risk that society runs when it attempts to distinguish between good and bad religions," he said in legal briefs.</blockquote>

<p>Where liberals rule, nothing goes unregulated &mdash; not <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/health/San-Franciscos-Rules-for-Making-Pot-Brownies-jw-97897874.html">even pot brownies</a>. In San Franfreakshow,</p>

<blockquote>the City's Department of Public Health has rules for legitimate edible cannabis treats at medical marijuana dispensaries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For instance, anything that requires refrigeration is right out unless the dispensary applies for an exemption, so you might want to rethink your plans for a soda fountain at your dispensary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In fact, making anything look like candy which might attract children &mdash; such as candy bars wrapped in packaging meant to mimic popular brands &mdash; is also forbidden.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The packaging does, however, have to state the amount of marijuana in the food, and whether it contains any potential allergens such as nuts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Only members of a dispensary are allowed to make the products, and if they intend to sell them at more than one location, they need to have a food handler's permit.</blockquote>

<p>Maybe that's the way to combat illicit drugs: have The State sanctify them, them regulate them until no one thinks they're fun anymore.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the same city is <a href="http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/07/san_francisco_starts_soda_ban.html">moving toward outlawing soda</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The San Francisco policy, the result of an executive order from Mayor Gavin Newsom, dictates vending machines on city property can no longer dispense Coke, Pepsi and other calorically sweetened beverages. Sports drinks and artificially sweetened water also are included in the ban.</blockquote>

<p>Next on the path to a total soda ban,</p>

<blockquote>Newsom also wants to impose a retail fee on soda, part of a multifaceted approach to tackling obesity.</blockquote>

<p>Newsom must force his subjects to stop drinking soda to compensate for the calories they'll pack on if <a href="http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ballot-measures/qualified-ballot-measures.htm">Proposition 19</a> passes, making marijuana brownies legal in California even for those who don't want to pretend they're "medicinal." But don't worry, the legal brownies will still be regulated down to the last psychotropic crumb.</p>

<p>They ought to be named Victory Brownies, in honor of the Victory Gin that Outer Party members guzzle to anesthetize themselves in <em>1984</em>.</p>

</p>

<p>In a recess appointment (to circumvent Senate hearings in which the radical views of his appointee would have been highlighted by Republican senators) Obama has appointed Donald Berwick to head up the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. He will be in charge of implementing the $500 Billion in cuts envisioned by ObamaCare (if they happen). </p>

<p><a href="http://wolffiles.blogspot.com/2010/06/obamas-rationing-man-sebelius-rationing.html">Milton Wolf has dug up some of Mr. Berwick's more colorful proclamations</a>. Among them:<br />
<blockquote>Any health care funding plan that is just, equitable, civilized and humane must, MUST redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the poorer and the less fortunate. Excellent health care is, by definition, redistributional.</blockquote>  </p>

<p>That is, despite everything the Obamunists claimed during the Health Care debate, ObamaCare is socialism. And it is just the beginning. What Berwick really admires is Britain's decrepit, bureaucratic National Health Service.</p>

<blockquote>I am romantic about the [British] National Health Service; I love it.</blockquote>

<p>Wolf notes that the imposition of NHS-style controls in the USA would lead to an additional 125,000 cancer deaths per year. But, that's okay, because sick and old people are not worth saving, <a href="http://blog.nj.com/njv_publicblog/2009/07/what_armband_is_ezekiel_emanue.html">or so Zeke Emanuel tells us</a>. </p>

<p>And in Massachusetts, where RomneyCare (the state version of ObamaCare) is crashing and burning,<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704324304575306861120760580.html"> a state legislator has introduced a bill to make it illegal to practice medicine outside of the Government Health Care system</a>.  </p>

<p>If our Government weren't being run by racialist Marxist ideologues, Arizona would be getting help and Philadelphia (and all other sanctuary cities) would be getting sued. <br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/pa/20100628_Philadelphia_to_bar_immigration_agents_from_arrest_data.html#ixzz0szgZAbPW">Philadelphia is expected to end the arrangement that permits federal immigration agents to scrutinize the city's computerized list of arrests</a>, including country of origin and other data, Everett Gillison, the deputy mayor for public safety, said Sunday.<br />
</blockquote><blockquote>Immigrant advocates say the year-old agreement between the city and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement service, known as ICE, has resulted in deportation proceedings against immigrants arrested on even minor charges. Under the agreement, ICE agents can routinely access the city's Preliminary Arraignment Reporting System (PARS). That agreement is up for renewal on Thursday.</blockquote></p>

<p>Illegal immigrants in Philadelphia literally cheered the announcement. So, now we have Chairman Zero and his gang of thugs suing Arizona, alleging that the state is interfering with Federal Immigration policy by enforcing Federal immigration law. Whereas Philadelphia is actually impeding the enforcement of immigration law and the Federal response is... nothing. </p>

<p>Another look at Samir Shabazz of the New Black Panthers, on whose behalf Obama's Justice Department has <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/06/ex-official-accuses-justice-department-racial-bias-black-panther-case/">turned the law upside down</a>:</p>

<p>We knew in advance that Obama hates Caucasians; he <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=25831">says so quite openly</a> in <em>Dreams of My Father</em>, which could be found on most liberal coffee tables in 2008. He was elected because it makes white liberals feel self-righteous to poke themselves in the eye. Unfortunately, we are all getting poked in the eye &mdash; and it is likely to get much worse, with Brownshirts like Shabazz in place and waiting.</p>

</p>

<p>Comrade Obama has been making ominous noises about impending "comprehensive immigration reform" &mdash; better known as amnesty. His response to the illegal immigration crisis could have been inspired by the <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/florida/fl-north-miami-haitians-20100702,0,4075996.story">Mayor of North Miami Beach</a>:</p>

<blockquote> Mayor Andre Pierre says 55,000 Haitians waiting for visas to the United States are welcome to settle in his city, WFOR-Ch. 4 reports.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pierre, a Haitian-American immigrant and lawyer, said he did not think the sudden influx of people from earthquake-ravaged Haiti would be a burden on his city of about 60,000 residents.</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, BHO doesn't seem to think the sudden influx resulting from effectively inviting the entire Third World to cross our resolutely undefended border and sign up for welfare will be a burden on the country.</p>

</p>

<p>Mitt Romney argues that of all President B. Hussein Obama's out-of-this-universe failures in foreign policy this year --  including shunning Israel while giving Hamas' rocket attacks a pass; "engagement" with N. Korea and Iran resulting in a more-nuclear N. Korea and Iran; and a unilateral bail on Eastern European missile defense with no Russian "reset" to show for it  -- none is more threatening to United States security than <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/05/AR2010070502657.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">the pending "New-START" treaty</a>. </p>

<blockquote>New-START impedes missile defense, our protection from nuclear-proliferating rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. Its preamble links strategic defense with strategic arsenal. It explicitly forbids the United States from converting intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos into missile defense sites. And Russia has expressly reserved the right to walk away from the treaty if it believes that the United States has significantly increased its missile defense capability.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hence, to preserve the treaty's restrictions on Russia, America must effectively get Russia's permission for any missile defense expansion. Moscow's vehemence over our modest plans in Eastern Europe demonstrate that such permission would be extremely unlikely. </blockquote>
<blockquote>
[...]</blockquote>

<blockquote>The treaty also gives far more to the Russians than to the United States. As drafted, it lets Russia escape the limit on its number of strategic nuclear warheads. Loopholes and lapses -- presumably carefully crafted by Moscow -- provide a path to entirely avoid the advertised warhead-reduction targets.</blockquote>

<p>The U.S. negotiators were so resoundingly out-negotiated in this New-START treaty that it could only have been on purpose, that they <em>wanted</em> to see America fail as a superpower. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/05/AR2010070502657.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">Romney's shocking list of revelations</a> goes far in showing just how low the Zero Regime is ready to go, in order to neuter America's strategic security position for generations to come. </p>

<p>John Derbyshire is someone I have often had disagreements with, and some people are off-put by his bluntness. But, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NmJkZjMzZjBiYmFlYjkxOGU0ZjcxYTFhNWIxZmZmZTY=">his take</a> on the news that the Obama Regime sees NASA's "<em>first and foremost</em>" purpose as "(to)<em> engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math, and engineering</em>" is pretty much right-on. <br />
<blockquote>Our government-funded space exploration, as embodied in NASA, can serve the great Obamanian cause of infantilizing and feminizing us. Government funds are wisely and properly used in turning us into obedient elementary-school tots being lectured at by our wise, benevolent moral superiors on the wonders of "diversity," sensitizing us to the feelings of different-looking peoples in far-away places, softening and erasing our gross brutish impulses to inquire, discover, explore, achieve, master (!), conquer, and win.</blockquote><blockquote>American history was, for a couple of centuries there, a contest between the frontiersmen and the schoolmarms. Well, that's all over. The schoolmarms have won.</blockquote></p>

<p>Yes, indeed. NASA's new mission is "To Boldly Coddle Muslims As No One Has Ever Been Coddled Before." <br />

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  9:59 AM


</p>

<p>What would happen if we do as our moonbat ruling class bids, and out of terror of being called "racist" allow Mexico's underclass to continue colonizing the Southwest? Maywood, California is what would happen.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/06/city-taken-over.html">mentioned earlier</a>, Maywood is almost completely Hispanic and largely populated by criminal aliens, which will soon be true of much of California, Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. Several years ago, when this quintessential sanctuary city disbanded the police department's traffic division for expecting "undocumented Americans" to comply with traffic laws, <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2006/03/maywood_califor.html">Moonbattery commented</a>,</p>

<blockquote>If illegal aliens continue to find themselves oppressed by running afoul of our laws, Maywood may want to disband the police department altogether.</blockquote>

<p>Now it has done so.</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/02/local/la-me-0702-maywood-20100702">At this point</a>, the only people left on the official payroll are the city manager, city attorney, and elected officials. Much like Mexico, this city of 40,000 people is disintegrating. Exactly what happens next inside City Hall may be difficult to tell:</p>

<blockquote>A sign at the entrance to City Hall read, "&hellip;the City Council has requested that from this date forward, no media will be permitted inside city hall&hellip;"</blockquote>

<p>An Obamunist would call this "transparency."</p>

<p>This is our country's future if we don't put up serious resistance and now.</p>

</p>

<p><a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2009/02/waste_not_want.html">Never let a serious crisis go to waste</a>, preaches Obama teleprompter-programmer Rahm "Dead Fish" Emanuel. After all, they're opportunities for our moonbat rulers to inflict an agenda that might result in rebellion under normal circumstances. The Deepwater Horizon disaster has been an opportunity not only to demonize the energy sector (which the bumbling crony capitalists at BP make easy) and to push Tax &amp; Charade, but to quietly tighten a Hugo Chavezesque fist around the dissemination of information.</p>

<p>Even the left-wing media that put the <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2008/06/post_turtle.html">turtle on his post</a> are growing alarmed. We saw CNN's hapless Anderson Duper plead with Chairman Zero like a dumped girlfriend with no sense of self-respect, "<a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/even-cnn-admits.html">We're not the enemy</a>." Now MSNBC reports <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38088288/ns/disaster_in_the_gulf/">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The Obama administration is expected to take over control of the central information website on the Gulf oil spill response that has been run jointly by various agencies and BP for the 2½ months since the rig explosion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Department of Homeland Security wants a one-stop shop for information that is completely overseen by the government as it settles into the long-haul of dealing with the response to the disaster.</blockquote>

<p>There's a term for "information that is completely overseen by the government": state propaganda. Those who have escaped to America from totalitarian regimes are familiar with it.</p>

<blockquote>BP and the federal government are part of a unified command that is working together to try to contain the oil gusher, but the government has been directing BP at every turn.</blockquote>

<p>But there always comes a point where the puppets are dispensed with. However, progressives still have some use for the crippled remnants of free enterprise:</p>

<blockquote>BP is helping pay for the current website. The government could still bill BP when it takes over the site.</blockquote>

<p>Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) comments:</p>

<blockquote>"Given that the government taking over the cleanup hasn't exactly fixed things, it's hard to imagine the government taking over a website making things much better either," Issa, a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said in a statement e-mailed to the AP.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In recent weeks, we've heard directly from local officials pleading for less bureaucracy, more resources and expressing an overall frustration with this administration's apparent pre-occupation with the public relations surrounding this catastrophe," he said.</blockquote>

<p>But for our Obamunist rulers, public relations is everything. They don't have to control the flow of oil or even refrain from getting in the way of cleanup efforts. It's much more important to control the flow of information.</p>

<p>One more word on the <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/item-2-nasas-ne.html">astounding revelation</a> that NASA's <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/05/nasa-chief-frontier-better-relations-muslims/">"foremost"</a> mission under our first Affirmative Action president is to "reach out" to Muslims and help them "feel good" about their (nonexistent for the last thousand years) scientific accomplishments &mdash; from <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/jeff-poor/2010/07/05/krauthammer-rips-nasa-chief-declaration-improve-relations-muslim-world#ixzz0suoXnJnB">Charles Krauthammer</a>:</p>

<p>That American "graffiti" flag paint-over incident in California <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2010/07/california-bure-2.html">reported recently</a> had a happy ending, just in time <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_15441273?nclick_check=1">for the 4th</a>.</p>

<blockquote>After an absence of a few days, a mural of an American flag has returned to a hillside above Interstate 680 in Sunol -- just in time for the Fourth of July.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[...]</blockquote>

<blockquote>On Saturday, the two men climbed the steep hill above the highway near the Sunol Grade and painted a bold new red, white and blue flag to replace the mural that a Caltrans crew painted over earlier in the week, news reports said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[...]</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Steve] Giordano and [...] Jim Gallagher, decided to restore the flag mural Caltrans painted over, proving that good, old-fashioned American ingenuity and the can-do spirit are not dead.</blockquote>

<p>The unpatriotic Caltrans insult was even more profound given the original flag mural's history.</p>

<blockquote>East Bay residents R.J. Waldron, Eric Noda and Thomas Hanley painted the 35-foot mural on Sept. 24, 2001, to honor those who died in the Sept. 11 terror attacks.</blockquote>

<p>Patriots like Waldron, Noda, Hanley, Giordano and Gallagher are great reminders that, when true defenders of our nation's founding principles arise, these colors won't run.</p>

<p>The progressive moonbat left hates air conditioning. Not only does it consume energy and make human lives more comfortable, <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/eddriscoll/2010/07/05/too-much-air-conditioning-makes-salon-boil-over/">it is also to blame for Republicanism</a>. <br />
<blockquote>Refrigerated cooling has been a major boon to the Republican Party. The advent of A.C. helped launch the massive Southern and Western population growth that's transformed our electoral map in the last half century. Cox navigates all of these scientific and social angles with relative ease, providing a clear explanation of how A.C. made the leap from luxury to necessity in the United States and examining how we can learn to manage the addiction before we refrigerate ourselves into the apocalypse.</blockquote></p>

<p>Well, if Dear Reader gets his way, there won't be enough energy to run air conditioning any more, so that won't be a problem.

In a far-reaching restatement of goals for the nation's space agency, NASA administrator Charles Bolden says President Obama has ordered him to pursue three new objectives: to "re-inspire children" to study science and math, to "expand our international relationships," and to "reach out to the Muslim world." <strong>Of those three goals, Bolden said in a recent interview with al-Jazeera, the mission to reach out to Muslims is "perhaps foremost," because it will help Islamic nations "feel good" about their scientific accomplishments.</strong></blockquote></p>

</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/plastic-bag-bans">The Moonbat-run state of California has moved to outlaw disposable shopping bags</a>, following the lead of the moonbat-run city of San Francisco. Everyone is obligated to use those flimsy woven plastic reusable bags. (Full disclosure: I use them, they carry a substantial load of groceries.) But, guess what, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7863807/Bags-for-life-could-have-E.coli.html">those disposable bags are veritable petri dishes for harmful bacteria</a>. <br />
<blockquote>Tests on shoppers' bags revealed half contained traces of E.coli, a lethal toxin which killed 26 people in Scotland in 1996 in one of the worlds worst food poisoning outbreaks.</blockquote><blockquote>Scientists also found many were contaminated with salmonella. </blockquote></p>

<p>You can wash them after each use, but that completely cancels out any ecological benefit the bags may have offered. </p>

<p>Once again, the country is better off with hippies tripping to rainbows at Yosemite than making policy in our city councils and legislatures. </p>

Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 10:45 AM


</p>

<p>Our envirofascist government hasn't allowed us to build a new refinery in decades. This increases the price of gasoline and our reliance on foreign energy, and undermines our security. But for the leftist radicals working busily to bring about our country's collapse, preventing new refineries isn't working fast enough. The aging refineries that have already been built must be <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100630/ap_on_bi_ge/us_epa_vs_texas">driven out of business</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday officially overturned a 16-year-old Texas air permitting program it says violates the Clean Air Act, leaving some of the country's largest refineries in a state of limbo. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The EPA's decision, announced in a statement, will force some 125 refineries and petrochemical plants to invest millions of dollars to get new permits. Many of the plants may also have to invest in updates to comply with federal regulations.</blockquote>

<p>The price for this will be paid by us at the pump, raising the cost of literally everything. Soon it will be economically infeasible to refine any oil at all in this country. Once again we see that our liberal rulers are doing everything they can think of to keep their "boot on the neck" of the economy and to lower our standard of living.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  9:54 AM


</p>

<p>How convenient for Mexican bandits that they no longer have to ride around under the desert sun with heavy bandoliers slung across their chests. With our quisling rulers on their side, looting us is so easy, children can do it. Our liberal kleptocracy confiscates taxpayer money to bus in Mexicans from across the border for free educations at our expense. Via <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/foiablog?page=6">Judicial Watch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>In a town famous for Pancho Villa's ransacking, the purloining still occurs; this time horses and mules are not disappearing, but taxpayer money is. Columbus, New Mexico is just 3 miles north of Palomas, Mexico and is one of the many border towns mired in the border fence, illegal immigration, and drug smuggling. The culprit in this case, however, is not El Chapo or a coyote, but rather residents in Mexico expecting American taxpayer benefits.</blockquote> 

<blockquote>Many families in Palomas, Mexico choose to send their children to Deming Public School District. Regardless of citizenship, these Palomas students are ineligible for Deming Public School education as they live out of the district and are not supporting the school through taxes. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>For school year 2008-2009, 506 students were transported from the Port of Entry to Deming Public Schools (and this number has been increasing for the past three years). Typically, the students cross the border where a public school bus waits for them and then transports them 30 miles to the schools in Deming.</blockquote>

<p>Where does the money come from to finance this lunacy? From you, of course.</p>

<blockquote>New Mexico will receive $537,047,803 from President Obama's stimulus plan to "lay the foundation for a generation of education reform and help save thousands of teaching jobs at risk due to state and local budget cuts."  That's right, the stimulus money will indirectly be funding education for students whose families do not pay taxes.</blockquote>

<p>Oh, it's part of the stimulus. Busing in Mexicans for free goodies &mdash; as if there weren't already more than enough Mexicans on this side of the border collecting free goodies &mdash; will stimulate our economy. For a moment there I thought America would once again receive no benefit whatsoever from this flagrant waste of its confiscated resources.</p>

<p>New Mexico isn't alone:</p>

<blockquote>A similar issue of "free education" has occurred in Arizona with many students crossing the Arizona border to attend school, some with fraudulent residency documents. In towns like Lukeville, the number of students boarding the bus exceeds the population of the town. In light of this, certain Arizona schools informed families that their children could continue to attend public schools only if they paid a fee as they did not pay the appropriate taxes. In 2004, the Arizona State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Tom Horne, led the initiative to prevent the swindling of taxpayers by investigating the residency of students. Enforcing district residency, however, led to controversy in Arizona with a lawsuit in 2005 accusing Bisbee Unified School District of discrimination.</blockquote>

<p><em>Discrimination</em>, like <em>racial profiling</em>, is an all-purpose charge that can be leveled at any attempt to resist first our money and then our very country from being stolen from us and handed over to parasitical Third World hordes by our treasonous moonbat rulers, who are waging a demographic war of obliteration against America.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Gregory of Yardale</font> at  4:05 AM


</p>

<p>What would the Fourth of July have been without at least one prominent progressive denouncing America and everything it stands for? </p>

<p>Progressive editor, blogger, and Air America (Remember those guys?) contributor Matthew Rothschild just wants you to know, <a href="http://www.progressive.org/wx070310.html">he hates patriotism</a>, hates it with all the sanctimonious fury someone who never matured beyond high school can manage.<blockquote>Nationalism is the egg that hatches fascism.</blockquote><blockquote>And patriotism is but the father of nationalism.</blockquote></p>

<p>Yeah, he's real big on the portentous one-sentence-paragraph, because this pounds home the importance of each thought. At least, that's what you think if you're 15 years old and writing for <em>Rise Up! A Journal of Youth in Revolution!</em>. After 8 - 10 one-sentence paragraphs, he wraps up with a cliche-driven paragraph of 3-4 sentences, as though it were the sum of all previous sentence/paragraphs. In this case, he uses the final para so he can piss and moan that patriotism prevents the USA from combating Manbearpig. <br />
<blockquote>American patriotism has also gotten in the way of solving global warming. Many in the United States, which consumes 25 percent of the world's resources but has just 4 percent of the world's population, believe we have the God-given right to use up all the resources we can. And there is an all-too-common attitude that we don't need to listen to any other countries, or the U.N., or obey any international agreements because we're Americans, and we're better than everybody else.</blockquote></p>

<p>If his previous articles are any guide, Matthew Rothschild is a one-man parade of progressive left douchebaggery. </p>


<p>He <a href="http://www.progressive.org/mc060910.html">was a big fan of Helen Thomas</a> and mourned her departure. <a href="http://www.progressive.org/wx032610.html">He also considers the the Tea Parties incipiently fascist</a>. Also, racist:  "<a href="http://www.progressive.org/rothschild0610.html">Many of the tea party people... actually despise not big government but "liberal" government, especially one that is led by a black man</a>." He lies awake at night terrified that <a href="http://www.progressive.org/wx021810.html">Keith Olbermann, Rachel Maddow, and his Marxist Messiah will be murdered by tea-partiers</a>. But he loves Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Kevin Jennings and of course Che Guevara. And <a href="http://www.progressive.org/mag_rampell122607">he never met an Anti-American agitprop movie he didn't like</a>. ("<em>Redacted</em>": Writer/director Brian De Palma's deploys a dazzling display of cinematic and New Media techniques to expose atrocities committed by U.S. soldiers in Iraq.") </p>

</p>

<p>With the sex education, and <a href="http://biggovernment.com/tag/fisting/">the GLSEN fisting seminars</a>, and the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37867175/">free distribution of the condoms in elementary school</a>, we on the right have always suspected that the left has an agenda to sexualize children as part of an overall agenda of leftist indoctrination and counter-cultural subversion. And <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-56344.html">back in the sixties and seventies, they were a helluva lot more open about it</a>.</p>


<blockquote>The educators' notes indicate that they placed a very strong emphasis on sex education. Almost every day, the students played games that involved taking off their clothes, reading porno magazines together and pantomiming intercourse.</blockquote>...<blockquote>Members of the 1968 movement and their successors were caught up in a strange obsession about childhood sexuality. It is a chapter of the movement's history which is never mentioned in the more glowing accounts of the era. On this issue, the veterans of the late '60s student movement seem to have succumbed to acute amnesia.</blockquote>...<blockquote>
Sexual liberation was at the top of the agenda of the young revolutionaries who, in 1967, began turning society upside down. The control of sexual desire was seen as an instrument of domination, which bourgeois society used to uphold its power. Everything that the innovators perceived as wrong and harmful has its origins in this concept: man's aggression, greed and desire to own things, as well as his willingness to submit to authority. The student radicals believed that only those who liberated themselves from sexual repression could be truly free.</blockquote>...<blockquote>Nowadays, the stimulation of a child's sex organs by an adult is clearly seen as criminal sexual assault. But for the revolutionaries of 1968, it was an educational tool that helped "create a new person," according to the "Handbook of Positive Child Indoctrination," published in 1971. "Children can learn to appreciate eroticism and sexual intercourse long before they are capable of understanding how a child is conceived. It is valuable for children to cuddle with adults. It is no less valuable for sexual intercourse to occur during cuddling."</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like the Safe School Czar's utopia. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/business/economic_stimulus_package/july_2010/29_say_stimulus_plan_helped_the_economy_43_say_it_hurt">Only 29% of Americans believe the Obamacrat Spendulus helped the economy</a>. <br />
<blockquote>The new survey found that just 29% believe last year's economic stimulus plan has helped the economy while 43% believe it hurt. Not surprisingly, there is little appetite for another round. By a 69% to 15% margin, voters believe tax cuts is a better way to create jobs rather than more government spending.</blockquote></p>

<p>And before the Obama fanboys dismiss these as typical bitter-clinger Americans who don't want to give a black man any credit, bear in mind that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/26/news/economy/NABE_survey/">73% of economists also think the Spendulus accomplished squat</a>.</p>

<p>The notion that borrowing billions from the Chinese and using it to pay bureaucrats to watch porn (i.e. Obamanomics) (<a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/46190-1.html?CMP=OTC-RSS">Democrats, by the way, earlier this year pulled a bill from the House Floor that would have punished bureaucrats for watching porn on the job</a>) is being rejected everywhere but the White House and Temple of the Obama Fanboys. Even the Europeans are backing off from socialism, while <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Money/The-Adam-Smith-Institute-Blog/2010/0625/Barack-Obama-The-last-European">Chairman Zero pathetically begs them to spend more money so he doesn't look bad</a>. </p>

<p>And it just keeps coming; over the weekend, Chairman Zero announced that $2 Billion in federal subsidies will be used to create 5,100 mostly temporary solar-energy jobs; <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2010/07/03/obama-lets-spend-2-billion-to-create-5100-jobs/">which works out to $392,000 per job</a>. </p>

<p>Even on the Fourth of July, the moonbat bureaucrats eating away our country from within like a runaway termite infestation <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38072154/ns/us_news-life/">remain impervious</a> to the noble sentiments inspired by Old Glory.</p>

<blockquote>The 35-foot long flag was painted on a concrete slab near Interstate 680 in Sunol [California] by three men about two weeks after the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even though the mural had been in clear view of commuters for nearly nine years, a Caltrans spokesman said it wasn't until last month that someone in the agency asked if the flag was on state property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Spokesman Allyn Amsk said it was covered up Wednesday morning.</blockquote>

<p>Just in time for America's birthday. The explanation:</p>

<blockquote>"We don't allow graffiti on state property," Amsk said Wednesday, the San Jose Mercury News reported.</blockquote>

<p>With bankruptcy looming, you would think California could find better uses for taxpayer money than to pay bureaucrats to suppress eruptions of patriotic sentiment. But as ever more of our country becomes state property, it will take ever more bureauweenies to keep it all looking appropriately soulless.</p>

</p>

<p>Governor Moonbeam has a detailed plan for how to prevent California from following close on the heels of Greece down the tubes into bankruptcy if voters are forgetful enough to put him back in office. <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2010/06/30/2861379/brown-says-hed-go-to-the-people.html#mi_rss=Top%20Stories">Here goes:</a></p>

<blockquote>"Anything you do, whether to cut or seek revenue, is going to require a vote of the people," Brown said. "That's really my plan - for the first time, level with the people and key up a couple of key choices on what the direction forward needs to be."</blockquote>

<p>Uh&hellip; sure. As for specifics of how he would fix the state's $19.1 billion shortfall:</p>

<blockquote>Pressed for detailed actions he would push in the budget debate, Brown largely demurred&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>Even Governor Moonbeam's <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2009/09/meg-whitman-hug.html">moonbat RINO</a> opponent, Meg Whitman, should have no problem revealing Brown as the same clueless kook we've been laughing at for decades.</p>

<blockquote>"His refusal to take leadership and outline any spending cuts or present any solutions to the unfunded pension liability is the very same 'process' that the Sacramento politicians have used to put California in the crisis it's in," Whitman spokeswoman Sarah Pompei said in a written statement.</blockquote>

<p>In case California voters have very short memories, here's who's going to be on the ballot for Governor:</p>

</p>

<p>Only the most deluded Obama fanboys --- like the ones who believed that ObamaCare would reduce the deficit --- <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/will-the-jobless-cost-democrats-their-jobs/?ref=opinion">are buying the administration's sunny spin on the dismal June economic numbers</a>. <br />
<blockquote>"The economy is headed in the right direction," President Obama told a crowd in Racine, Wis., the other day. It's unclear whether the assembled Cheeseheads took his word for it. But it's very clear that even the most liberal bloggers did not. </blockquote></p>

<p>Why should they believe him when his deputy, Sheriff Joe Biden, was telling people that <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2010/06/28/biden-no-way-will-we-get-the-lost-jobs-back/">eight million jobs are gone and they're never coming back</a>. </p>

<p>But maybe massive unemployment really is good news. <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/2010/07/01/pelosi-unemployment-checks-best-way-to-create-jobs/">Nancy Pelosi says unemployment checks are the best form of stimulus there is</a>. She'll be proven right if about 200 Democrat members of Congress and a few hundred thousand Federal bureaucrats start receiving them. </p>

<p>I wish I could believe we are in the early stages of a recovery, but I just don't see how it's going to happen when the private sector is being slammed with new regulatory mandates like ObamaCare, that make it much more expensive to hire new workers, when new financial regulations are going to add to the cost of making loans to business; massive tax increases slated to go into effect in 2011; and the threat of draconian environmental regulations through Cap and Trade. Not to mention Federal deficits hoovering up dollars and making them into transfer payments to bureaucrat pension funds. </p>

<p>Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the supercompetent megageniuses in the Obama Regime can make socialism work this time. How much harder can running a 14 Trillion dollar economy be versus cleaning up an oil spill or running an automotive rebate program? </p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 10:14 AM


</p>

<p>Comrade Obama has already used the Deepwater Horizon mess as a pretext to throw <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/06/25/news/economy/shallow_drilling_ban/index.htm">hundreds out of work</a> in Gulf states. If he manages to <a href="http://www.domain-b.com/industry/oil_gas/20100623_white_house.html">override</a> Judge Martin Feldman's hold on his drilling moratorium, the ripple effects will allow him to unemploy thousands. If he gets <a href="http://www.vindy.com/news/2010/jun/17/8216cap-and-trade8217-will-wreck-the-us-/?newswatch">Cap &amp; Tax</a> through the Senate, the job casualties are likely to number in the millions.</p>

<p>The point? The more people are thrown out of work, the more lose faith in themselves and in freedom, and look to all-powerful, all-pervasive Big Government to spread somebody else's wealth their way. The strategy allowed FDR to rule much like a socialist dictator for a dozen years. This is why literally every major initiative on the Democrat agenda &mdash; massive deficit spending, amnesty, Tax &amp; Charade, ObamaCare, Card Check, etc. &mdash; can be expected to drive up unemployment.</p>

</p>

<p>Progressives are at their most depraved and nakedly evil when expressing their contempt for human life. The concept of sympathy cards for men who lose children to abortion has induced liberal blogger <a href="http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/thwarted_sperm_finally_have_an_advocate/">Amanda Marcotte</a> to cough up this clot of bile:</p>

<blockquote>Anti-choicers [are] pretending that they just discovered they oppose abortion because it violates men's rights over their uterine property (established by the "poke it/own it" law laid down in beer commercials).</blockquote>

<p>It's not about a child's life; it's about who "owns" a woman's uterus, according to the left's bizarre and heartless politics.</p>

<p>The charming Marcotte (formerly <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2007/02/blogger_amanda.html">John Edwards's official blogger</a>) sneeringly offers some sympathy cards of her own, <a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/assets_c/2010/07/amanda-marcotte-card-2349.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.moonbattery.com/assets_c/2010/07/amanda-marcotte-card-2349.html','popup','width=414,height=290,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">like this one</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn't get any better in the comments section. Here's a gem:</p>

<blockquote>If a man tried to pull that crap with me, I'd tell him that if he cares about the embryo so much then he should get to work on inventing a way to transfer the pregnancy into his own body.  Oh, you don't really want this thing to leech off your body for several months?  Well, I don't either.</blockquote>

<p>Another:</p>

<blockquote>I think that the special sort of douchebag who would get all butthurt because his sperm was rejected is probably likely to have behaved like a complete and utter cock before the decision to abort, which may have been a big contributing factor to having the procedure done.</blockquote>

<p>Darwin would be pleased to note that their own ideology mercifully prevents the vermin who frequent blogs like Marcotte's from reproducing.</p>

</p>

<p>The St. Louis Cardinals' Tony La Russa isn't just one of the greatest managers in the history of the game. He's a true American, with the spine to defy the liberal establishment by speaking in favor of freedom of expression and the rule of law. Here he is standing with supporters of Arizona's SB1070:</p>

<div align="center"><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-vPDNDS5fug&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-vPDNDS5fug&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></div>

<p>Predictably, the libs dominating the sports media are squawking like wet hens as they resort to typically underhanded &mdash; you might even say vile &mdash; propaganda tactics. Raves <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/tony-la-russas-support-of-arizona-immigration-law-insults-players-070210">Jon Paul Morosi</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Despite winning nearly 5,000 games, Tony La Russa doesn't get it. &hellip;based on remarks he made this week, it's apparent that he's out of touch with the multicultural group of men responsible for his forthcoming trip to Cooperstown. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fans are usually charmed by leaders who speak their mind, and La Russa often does. But he should have punted on this one. Baseball prides itself on welcoming players of every creed and color. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>And lest we forget: The Cardinals employ Albert Pujols, one of the finest players &mdash; Latino or otherwise &mdash; in the game's history.</blockquote>

<p>Unless Pujols is an illegal alien, he was right when he said of the issue, "It's not my business." But of course, libs want to convince us that enforcing immigration law oppresses all Hispanics. If you dare speak in favor of  sovereignty and rule of law, then you are a RACIST!</p>

<p>If the moonbats peddling this hogwash don't know any better, they are idiots. Otherwise they are liars.</p>

<p>Morosi specifically criticizes La Russa for not being a coward:</p>

<blockquote>La Russa is a very smart man. He should have realized the weight of what he said on Tuesday. But rather than taking the humble approach &mdash; backpedal like hell, as a courtesy to his Latino players &mdash; he merely clarified his explanation.</blockquote>

<p>The only brake on the road to totalitarianism is real men willing to say what they really think while trained lapdogs like Morosi nip at their ankles for not conforming to groupthink. Once again La Russa has earned the highest kudos.</p>

<blockquote>In office for barely two years, Obama entered the survey in the 15th position - two spots behind Bill Clinton and three spots ahead of Ronald Reagan.</blockquote></p>

<p>But seriously, what did Reagan do besides defeat the Soviet Union and set the American economy on track for two decades of robust growth? </p>

<blockquote>Obama got high marks for <strike>intelligence, ability to communicate and imagination</strike>  being able to read a Teleprompter,</blockquote>

<p>Fixed it for them. <br />
<blockquote> but his score was dragged down by his relative lack of experience and family background.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>"Most of the presidents came from elite backgrounds, and he certainly did not," said professor Douglas Lonnstrom, who crunched the numbers. "He grew up without a father."</blockquote>

<p>Interesting. His score was not brought down by the total frakking incompetence he has displayed in handling the oil spill, his massive expansion of debt, the miserable failure of his economic polices, or  the corruption running rampant in his administration.... but because academic elites look down on those who don't come from elite backgrounds and are raised in single parent households? </p>

</p>

<p><a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/06/29/doctor-treating-pregnant-women-with-experimental-drug-to-prevent-lesbianism">A doctor is working on a way to treat and detect lesbianism in unborn babies</a>. This will give parents the option of either treating the pre-natal WNBA fans, or aborting them. <br />
<blockquote>Pediatric endocrinologist Maria New--of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and Florida International University--isn't just trying to prevent lesbianism by treating pregnant women with an experimental hormone. She's also trying to prevent the births of girls who display an "abnormal" disinterest in babies, don't want to play with girls' toys or become mothers, and whose "career preferences" are deemed too "masculine." </blockquote></p>

<p>For the right, no dilemma. We welcome babies into the world regardless of their potential. For the left, dilemma. Abortion dogma would seem to indicate a woman has the right to do whatever she wants to the life inside of her. After all, if she can kill it --- the ultimate act of control --- any lesser act of control is permitted. That same dogma states that no one but the woman has the right to tell her under what reasons it is permissible to abort, so aborting a child because you don't want a gay has to be permitted. </p>

<p>Left-wing ethicists will have to work this one out, somehow.</p>

And he writing checks for stupid stuff that the homeowner doesn't want! And, "Hey! I can't afford that!"</blockquote><blockquote>"No problem," the Congressman says.

</p>

<p>How will our healthcare dollars be spent, now that adolescent Marxists like Barry Soetoro are taking over the industry? The Department of Health and Human Services <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/39274.html">offers a clue</a>:</p>

<blockquote>With HHS's rollout of a new web portal, HealthCare.Gov, you can investigate health insurance plans and provisions of the new health care law. And for a while, you could also learn some not so health-related information, like that <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/">HealthCare.Gov</a> enjoys P. Diddy&hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Alongside the portal that went live last night, HHS launched a Twitter feed at the handle <a href="http://www.twitter.com/healthcaregov">@healthcaregov</a>, and it came with a notably odd list of "favorite tweets"&hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The HealthCare.Gov collection was diverse and confusing &mdash; all Tweets written well over a year ago, and none having any clear connection to the agency or to health reform.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rapper P. Diddy, who tweets at @iamdiddy, dominated the favorite list, accounting for five of HHS's 14 favorite items. One Nov. 1, 2009 written at 1:28 a.m., apparently struck a chord with the federal agency: "Happy Halloween!!!!" Diddy wrote. "CIROC all night long! GO!!!!" HHS seemingly liked the 1:40 a.m. follow-up, too: "Get your Halloween right with Ciroc! The smoothest vodka in the game! Let's go people!Ciroc the official vodka of Halloween! :) boo!"</blockquote>

<p>No need to shout boo. With these clowns having seized control of the healthcare industry, the country is already scared stiff.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at 10:33 AM


</p>

<p>If you follow through on environmentalist ideology, it isn't only modern man who is evil and must be scrubbed from the planet &mdash; it's the entire human race. Even noble savages were a blemish before the eyes of Gaia. For example, cavemen <a href="http://www.agu.org/news/press/pr_archives/2010/2010-15.shtml">started global warming by hunting mammoths</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Mammoths used to roam modern-day Russia and North America, but are now extinct &mdash; and there's evidence that around 15,000 years ago, early hunters had a hand in wiping them out. A new study, accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), argues that this die-off had the side effect of heating up the planet.</blockquote>

<p>This one required scholarly moonbats to twist their addled brains into entirely new contortions:</p>

<blockquote>First, mammoth populations began to drop &mdash; both because of natural climate change as the planet emerged from the last ice age, and because of human hunting. Normally, mammoths would have grazed down any birch that grew, so the area stayed a grassland. But if the mammoths vanished, the birch could spread. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>The trees would change the color of the landscape, making it much darker so it would absorb more of the Sun's heat, in turn heating up the air. This process would have added to natural climate change, making it harder for mammoths to cope, and helping the birch spread further.</blockquote>

<p>What was that about natural climate change? They were almost starting to make sense for a moment.</p>

<p>Bad enough our eco-insensitive ancestors started global warming by oppressing the noble mammoths when they could have eaten alfalfa sprouts and tofu instead. What's worse is that they also started global cooling <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/05/mammoth-extinction-triggered-climate-cooling/1">the same way</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Extinction of mammoths, camels, giant sloths and other large mammals in the New World may have cooled the global climate about 11,500 years ago, suggest paleobiologists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The culprit? Less of the greenhouse gas, methane, emitted by the massive herbivores.</blockquote>

<p>But the ultimate culprit, as always these days, is the human race:</p>

<blockquote>"About 13,400 years ago, the Americas were heavily populated with large-bodied herbivores," says the study in the current Nature Geosciences study led by biologist Felisa Smith of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. "However, by 11,500 years ago and within 1,000 years of the arrival of humans in the New World, 80% of these large-bodied mammals were extinct." &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We are not the first to suggest that human-mediated activities influenced the planet prior to the industrial age&hellip; Although still controversial, the megafaunal extinction is the earliest catastrophic event attributed to human activities," conclude the Nature Geosciences study authors.</blockquote>

<p>The usual conclusion can be drawn: the clueless "experts" on climate change don't know much of anything except that they don't like human beings. But according to our rulers, that's no reason not to surrender our standard of living and the last of our liberties in the name of combating the imaginary menace.</p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  9:24 AM


</p>

<p>In case anyone failed to grasp that the long-term objective of ObamaCare is to <a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=172929">nationalize the insurance industry</a>:</p>

<blockquote>A socialist organization with close ties to Barack Obama has outlined a plan to turn the president's health-care legislation into a government-run system that will ultimately eliminate private insurance companies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obama's health-care bill "should create millions of new stakeholders in a health-care system governed by democratically established rules rather than by the fiats of private insurers," wrote Frank Llewellyn, national director of Democratic Socialists of America.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Writing in the latest issue of the socialist Democratic Left magazine, Llewellyn said "progressives" must use Obama's health-care legislation "to build support for the elimination of private insurers."</blockquote>

<p>Lift the rock of Obama's background and prominent members of Llewellyn's Democratic Socialists of America can be found among the repugnant creatures that wiggle and writhe in horror of the light. For example:</p>

<blockquote>Quentin Young, considered the father of the U.S. single-payer movement, is a longtime DSA activist. He has had a relationship with Obama, particularly in the 1990s, when he reportedly advised Obama on health care.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Young was reportedly present at a 1995 meeting at the home of former Weather Underground terrorist William Ayers who was said to have launched Obama's political career.</blockquote>

<p>That Obama's ultimate objective is to completely nationalize healthcare insurance will come as no surprise to anyone who watched the 2008 presidential debates, where the Manchurian Moonbat stated point-blank that healthcare is a "human right." Artificial rights to goods and services provided by others, irrespective of ability or willingness to pay for them, can only be granted by an authoritarian government that controls those goods and services.</p>

<p>Coming soon: a "human right" to government-provided food, clothing, shelter, etc.</p>

<p>There are only two differences between what is happening to America and the Russian Revolution: 1) in America, the imposition of communism is occurring at a slightly slower pace; and 2) the Russians resisted in a bloody civil war.</p>

</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/tech/Google-to-Pay-More-for-Gay-Employees-97581254.html">Google has a new policy that they will from now on pay gay employees more than straight employees</a>. <br />
<blockquote>Starting Thursday, Google will begin paying its gay and lesbian employees  who opt for domestic partner benefits more to cover for a tax those employees have to pay, the New York Times reports.</blockquote><blockquote>The pay raise will be retroactive to the beginning of 2010. Heterosexual employees with long-term partners won't get the raise, because they could marry and therefore get the tax break if they wished.</blockquote></p>

<p>Google is a private company, and it is free to compensate employees as it chooses to. However, I suspect that a company that chose to pay heterosexuals more than gays would be trampled in the stampede of discrimination lawyers. </p>

<p class="posted">
Posted by <font color="#B22222">Dave Blount</font> at  8:24 AM


</p>

<p>The thugs running the Democrat Party &mdash; and by extension, our country &mdash; have <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0610/39225.html">forbidden</a> Republicans from visiting the mess Obama's incompetence and/or malignance has caused in the Gulf:</p>

<blockquote>Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) wanted to fly 10 lawmakers down to the Gulf of Mexico to see the damage caused by BP's gigantic oil spill first hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>House Democrats said no.</blockquote>

<p>The request was denied by the House Administration Committee, using bureaucratic doubletalk and references to BHO's Department of Homeland Security as grounds for its refusal.</p>

<blockquote>Republicans, however, say Rep. Bob Brady (D-Pa.), who chairs the committee, has approved at least a dozen such trips in 2009 alone &mdash; something Democrats don't deny. &hellip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Republicans say that Democrats are just trying to shield lawmakers from going to see the damage in the Gulf.</blockquote>

<p>More specifically, they may not want Republicans to see that the cleanup efforts are <a href="http://www.wkrg.com/gulf_oil_spill/article/former-oil-worker-says-cleanup-just-for-show/899852/Jun-24-2010_8-46-pm/">a farce</a>:</p>

<blockquote>GULF SHORES, Alabama - Former oil clean-up worker Candi Warren says she signed up to make a difference, but soon found out the work of cleaning the beaches was all cosmetic.</blockquote>

</p>

<p>It's a classic whine with a piquant bouquet of failure. Mr. Randy Dorn, who is paid $121,000 per year as Washington State's Superintendent of Public Schools, <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/6420ap_wa_dorns_paycheck.html">whined to the state legislature about his pittance of a salary earlier this week</a>. <br />
<blockquote>"It would be embarrassing," Dorn told the House Ways and Means Committee last week in comments that have drawn flak. "Somebody who's responsible for 1,050,000 kids would only add up to a few pitches by a guy for the Seattle Mariners."</blockquote></p>

<p>First of all, Cliff Lee's salary is a reflection of the money he enables his employers, the Seattle Mariners, to make. Your salary, Mr. Dorn, is provided by the taxpayers. You are, essentially, a parasite. </p>

<p>Second, Cliff Lee is a professional, an elite in a profession who plays at a level a scant few can achieve. You, Mr. Dorn, are a bureaucrat. You provide no service that isn't duplicated by hundreds of thousands of other bureaucrats around the country.</p>

<p>Third, Mr Lee's salary is related to his performance. As a public schools educrat, Mr Dorn, that is the the last thing you want to be measured against. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.handsacrossthesand.com">The environmental left in America wants to halt all US domestic oil production</a>, which naturally means it would be forced offshore to places where the people are darker skinned and environmental standards are non-existent: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/06/29/nigeria.oil/index.html?iref=NS1">Like Nigeria</a><br />
<blockquote> Nigeria's Niger Delta is one of the most oil-polluted places on the planet with more than 6,800 recorded oil spills, accounting for anywhere from 9 million to 13 million barrels of oil spilled, according to activist groups.</blockquote><blockquote>But occurring over the 50 years since oil production began in the Delta, this environmental disaster has never received the attention that is now being paid to the oil-spill catastrophe hitting the U.S. Gulf coast.</blockquote></p>

<p>Of course not. Dark skinned people don't deserve a clean environment. Nor do they deserve democracy, if I understand left wing philosophy properly. </p>

</p>

<p><em><strong>Good Morning Right-Wing Patriots and Silly Left-Wing Poltroons (Perhaps We'll Have a Gay Post for you later? Wouldn't you like that, hm?) </strong></em></p>

<p>Sub-Item 1.a.: <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/jeff-poor/2010/06/30/disappointing-not-unexpected-huffpo-comedy-celebrates-tea-party-jesus">The HuffPo is promoting something they call "Tea Party Jesus," which is sort of like LOL Cats but 4 million times lamer</a>. "The concept behind the site Tea Party Jesus is simple: Put the words of conservative Christian social and political figures in the mouth of Christ. The juxtaposition of hateful, ignorant, or otherwise nonsensical rants with serene photos of JC himself isn't only funny, but says a lot about the people who claim to be Christians."</p>

<p>It isn't, and it doesn't. But it does reveal a great deal about the sanctimoniousness of progressive leftists. </p>

<p>Sub-Item 1.b.: Meanwhile <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nathan-burchfiel/2010/06/30/american-atheist-editor-christian-daycare-child-abuse">the editor of American Atheist says putting kids in Christian Daycare is "a form of child abuse."</a> <br />
<blockquote>"At least let your child begin in a secular world, and if he or she chooses Christianity after an age of accountability, then so be it. But forcing them to learn things as fact that you don't even know to be true is a form of child abuse<u><em>: inducing psychosis with thoughts of good and evil watching over them, as if they are constantly being graded or evaluated</em></u>."</blockquote></p>

<p>That last bit illustrates the real motivation behind many who reject God. It's not out of disbelief as much as it is rejection of the existence of objective good and evil. It's much more temporally gratifying to define good as "Stuff I like" and evil as "Stuff I don't like." And if Richard Dawkins taught us anything, it's that it's not enough to just opt out of religious belief; you also have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think the same as you.  </p>
