<p>All claims by Buyer,

        shortage must be made within <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIVE (5) business days of receipt of goods</span> by calling your eoilcolab sales representative and also must be made in writing and received by Seller within 5 business

At the time of your call, if your representative authorizes the return,
he or she will provide you with a Return Materials Authorization (RMA)
number. This number must be clearly marked using new return address
labels. Every piece you will be returning must be clearly labeled with
the correct eoilcolab Distribution Center address (provided to you by your sales
representative) and our RMA number. Failure to include this RMA number
on the returning pieces will result in a delay of processing your
credit and an automatic 20% re-stocking fee.<br></p>If an error has been made on a written order, we will gladly pay for
re-shipment. All errors arising from communication on verbal orders
will be the sole responsibility of the consumer. Please submit orders
on-line or in writing whenever possible.<br><br>To receive full
credit, the returning merchandise must be returned in its original
packaging with the tamper evident seal intact. All merchandise returned must be in good condition
