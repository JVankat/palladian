His injuries left him permanently disabled, both physically and mentally. It cost the public health system $800,000 to treat him in the initial stages.</p><p>The case is profound, not only because of the devastating injuries Brown suffered in the 1999 accident, but also because it represents one of the reasons the B.C. government is proclaiming legislation April 1 that will force insurers to reimburse the government for the hospital and other medical costs of treating victims of negligence like Brown.</p><p>Court documents show that in 2002, Brown's lawyers reached an out-of-court personal injury settlement with Tricon Global Restaurants (doing business as Pizza Hut) and the Insurance Corp. of B.C. (on behalf of Gomes) for $4.1 million to cover the costs of his future care.</p><p>Asked to help arrange an interview with Brown, his lawyer at the time, Kent Scarborough, said:</p><p>"Mr. Brown, my client, is severely brain-damaged and would not be able to communicate with you. This matter is now being handled by the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee.</p><p>"I can advise you that the terms of this settlement are confidential and as such, neither Mr. Brown, nor any of his representatives, including legal counsel, are in a position to discuss this matter with you."</p><p>While Brown's legal team was able to secure a settlement for his future care, what about the costs to taxpayers who funded his acute medical care immediately after the accident?</p><p>The B.C. government tries to recover treatment expenses in personal-injury cases using little-known regulations on the books since 1950. The recovery is sought from the companies and insurers of those who negligently caused the injuries.</p><p>But since the decades-old law did not include penalties for non-compliance, it was viewed by the insurance industry as nothing more than a gentlemen's agreement. Not all insurers representing those who have caused personal injuries pony up.</p><p>Brown's case is a perfect example.</p><p>According to court documents, Brown suffered multiple skull fractures in the collision causing permanent cognitive impairment, as well as pelvis and leg fractures.</p><p>Pizza Hut has steadfastly refused to pay the $1 million (including accrued interest) for Brown's medical bills on the grounds, according to its corporate lawyer, that it is not legally required to do so and because it is in a battle with its insurers over whether the pizza delivery driver was even covered by their insurance policy.</p><p>Outright refusals to pay are not the norm, according to government officials, so the Pizza Hut case is unusual. But the government still estimates that millions more dollars each year could be recovered if all insurers paid medical costs. So on April 1, the government will activate the Health Care Costs Recovery Act, passed last year, which replaces the 1950 legislation. It will remedy the problem and force insurers to repay the medical costs of those who are injured as a result of the wrongdoing of another.</p><pagebreak></pagebreak><p>"Optimistically, we might get as much as much as $10 million a year," Health Minister George Abbott said in an interview.</p><p>A recent letter to insurers from their representative organization, the Insurance Bureau of Canada, explains that the new law will allow the government to enter into contingency-fee arrangements with lawyers, under which lawyers would represent not only the injured plaintiff's interests but also the government's.</p><p>In essence, the new legislation will give government the legal authority to make negligent people and insured companies pay the medical bills of those wronged by their conduct. It enables the government to recoup the costs of a broad range of medical expenses besides hospitalization, including ambulance services, drug treatment, and service by all allied health professionals.</p><p>Clayton MacKay, who owns Mac-Kay Adjusters, is the tenacious agent the government has turned to for several years to help recover unpaid hospital bills. He pursues up to 100 cases a year and has spent several years doggedly pursuing Pizza Hut and its corporate executives, directors and lawyers, to no avail.</p><p>Although the old law didn't compel corporations and insurers to reimburse the government for medical costs, he still has had success in other cases recovering funds because insurers recognize that the 1950 law was voluntary and appropriate, not to mention a way to avoid over-regulation, he said.</p><p>"It sounds weird in today's business world, but in 1950, the government took [insurers] at their word ... that they would pay these costs voluntarily," MacKay said in an interview.</p><p>"But unfortunately some have taken advantage of the voluntary nature of the agreement and left the health ministry short millions."</p><p>In a letter sent to Douglas Harrison, a Toronto lawyer representing Pizza Hut, MacKay urged him to settle, suggesting that it had an important corporate image and brand to uphold:</p><p>"The Province is asking for fair consideration of the hospital account," said the letter, obtained by The Vancouver Sun. "These accounts are paid in all other provinces and although the protocol is different in B.C., the expectation is the same. Hospital costs need to be dealt with where there is liability for an accident.</p><p>"This is of special concern today when hospital finances are under such close public and political scrutiny."</p><p>Harrison sent back a letter stating that not only was the company not legally obliged to pay, but that the insurance company representing Yum!Brands Global Restaurants (the Canadian entity that now owns Pizza Hut) had denied coverage of the claim and that litigation over that was underway in Ontario Superior Court.</p><p>"Accordingly, as Yum!Brands Canada has had to pay its portion of the settlement of the Brown claim itself and now sue Zurich and is not an insurer and therefore not party to the arrangement the B.C. Ministry of Health has with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, Yum! Brands will not be making any voluntary payments at this time in respect of Mr. Brown's hospitalization account."</p><pagebreak></pagebreak><p>In an e-mail message to The Sun, Harrison said, referring to the out-of- court settlement: "Neither Pizza Hut nor Yum! Restaurants International (Canada) LP were found to be negligent. Out of good faith, Pizza Hut provided Mr. Brown with assistance to aid his recovery. I should note that the driver was an independent contractor, not an employee of Pizza Hut or Yum! Canada. Yum! Canada does not operate any company-stores in British Columbia."</p><p>MacKay, who earns an undisclosed commission on money he collects on behalf of the government, said when he got that letter, he understood Pizza Hut's intent to "squeak out on a technicality" but he vowed not to give up.</p><p>"Pizza Hut sells a lot of pizzas. The parent company has annual earnings of $10 billion. But this hospital bill will always be outstanding and I will always have the file. I've offered to make a deal at a lower amount and still they have refused.</p><p>"Our health care network is set up to protect individuals, not to protect the balance sheet of major corporations. Most insurers and corporations have understood this and have no problem paying voluntarily what they accept as a responsibility."</p><p>When the new legislation takes effect, MacKay is not sure if the government will still need to contract with him, but he will continue pursuing old cases.</p><p>"I'll continue to work on the uncollected files, appealing to presidents, CEO's, boards of directors and anyone else who might not understand the impropriety of not paying hospital costs when their client causes those costs to be incurred. There is a moral and ethical obligation not to abuse the social health care system," he said, referring to his work as the government's sole contractor in such cases.</p><p>When the government announced it would bring in the new legislation, allowing it to recoup medical costs, Health Minister Abbott said he expected it to help keep the medical system sustainable. The government will now be able to join in class-action lawsuits and other legal actions against third-party wrongdoers and their insurers.</p><p>"B.C. is the only province not to have legislation that would allow government to recover health-care costs associated with personal injuries that stem from the negligence or wrongdoing of a third party," Abbott said, adding that when he first became health minister in 2005, he agreed with ministry staff that it was important public policy.</p><p>"It was raised as an issue and I was persuaded and we brought it in as expeditiously as we could. We looked at legislation in other provinces and made sure we got the best of everything," he said.</p><p>"The legislation will strengthen government's ability to more effectively hold individuals and companies more accountable and ensure that those who commit wrong-doing and not the taxpayers, pay for the past and potential future [public] health care costs for impacted individuals."</p><pagebreak></pagebreak><p>Michelle Stewart, a spokeswoman for the health ministry, said under the new legislation, plaintiffs who commence a personal injury court action (ICBC and WCB cases are exempted) will have to include a claim for their health care costs. (Hospitals and other health providers have developed detailed lists of what everything costs and they must now provide detailed accounts to lawyers involved in such cases.)</p><p>Once funds are recovered, they must be held in trust for the government and then eventually turned over. The affected individual's claim will always take priority over payment to the province.</p><p>MEDICAL COSTS IN PERSONAL DAMAGES CASES</p><p>Legislation to come into effect April 1 will compel companies and/or their insurers to reimburse the government for hospital costs stemming from negligent actions. The law will replace older, weaker legislation that has had a mixed effect. Here's a partial list of cases insurance adjustor Clayton MacKay has pursued on behalf of the government:</p><p>- A tubing accident in the Okanagan sent an individual to hospital, resulting in $20,000 in costs. MacKay has been pressing the insurer for the boating company to pay up.</p><p>- He has pursued, for several years, the insurer for a commercial long-distance trucker who caused a motor-vehicle accident resulting in injuries to motorists.</p><p>- Canada Safeway, Save On Foods and Loblaws are being asked to pay medical expenses for customers who were injured after slips and falls in the stores.</p><p>- A room divider at the Pacific National Exhibition fell over, injuring a woman. After MacKay intervened, the insurer reimbursed the government for the hospital bill.</p><p>- At a North Vancouver restaurant, staff removed a handicapped-access ramp after a blind patron entered. When the woman left, she fell down the stairs because the ramp was no longer there. A settlement for the hospital bill was negotiated.</p><p>- A drunk tenant fell down the stairs in the home he was renting and hospital costs of nearly $200,000 were incurred. The tenant sued the landlord over unsafe railing and stairs. The landlord's insurers paid 20 per cent of the hospital bills.</p><p>- At a dinner party held in a home under construction, a guest leaving through the back door fell six feet off the unlit landing, breaking her hip. The hospital account was $100,000 and the entire sum was recovered.</p><p>pfayerman@vancouversun.com</p><div class="copyright">© (c) CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc.</div><script type="text/javascript">
