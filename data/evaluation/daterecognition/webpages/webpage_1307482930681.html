	<meta name="description" content="Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Junior was an American archaeologist most famously known as Indiana Jones or Indy. During World War I, he used the name Henri Defense, and went by a number of aliases throughout his life. He was married at least twice, fathered a son and daughter, and had several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Throughout his career he found numerous famous mythological artifacts, including the Sankara Stones, the Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail, and the Crystal Skull of Akator, which placed him in conflict with different groups across the globe." />

<p><b>Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Junior</b> was an American <a href="/wiki/Archaeologist" title="Archaeologist">archaeologist</a> most famously known as <b>Indiana Jones</b> or <b>Indy</b>. During <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, he used the name <b>Henri Defense</b>, and went by <a href="/wiki/List_of_aliases_and_nicknames_of_Indiana_Jones" title="List of aliases and nicknames of Indiana Jones">a number of aliases</a> throughout his life. He was married at least twice, fathered a <a href="/wiki/Mutt_Williams" title="Mutt Williams">son</a> and <a href="/wiki/Old_Indy%27s_daughter" title="Old Indy's daughter">daughter</a>, and had several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Throughout his career he found numerous famous mythological artifacts, including the <a href="/wiki/Sankara_Stones" title="Sankara Stones">Sankara Stones</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Grail" title="Holy Grail">Holy Grail</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Skull_of_Akator" title="Crystal Skull of Akator">Crystal Skull of Akator</a>, which placed him in conflict with different groups across the globe. 
</p><p>Born <a href="/wiki/July_1" title="July 1">July 1</a>, <a href="/wiki/1899" title="1899">1899</a> in <a href="/wiki/Princeton" title="Princeton">Princeton</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, Jones' life was indelibly influenced when he accompanied his parents, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Walton_Jones,_Sr." title="Henry Walton Jones, Sr." class="mw-redirect">Henry Sr.</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anna_Jones" title="Anna Jones" class="mw-redirect">Anna Jones</a> on a world lecture tour from <a href="/wiki/1908" title="1908">1908</a> to <a href="/wiki/1910" title="1910">1910</a>. Throughout his travels, Jones encountered many important figures in history who shaped his outlook on life. After the return home, his mother became ill and died. Father and son relocated to <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a> in <a href="/wiki/1912" title="1912">1912</a> but without Anna, their relationship became increasingly strained. As Henry Sr. withdrew into his studies, Indiana found himself in various locations as his father lectured once again.
</p><p>By <a href="/wiki/1916" title="1916">1916</a>, Indiana and his father had moved back to Princeton. While on Spring Break that year, Indiana quit high school, briefly participated in the <a href="/wiki/Mexican_Revolution" title="Mexican Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a>, and spent the next three years fighting in World War I. Afterwards, he attended the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, where he studied under Professor <a href="/wiki/Abner_Ravenwood" title="Abner Ravenwood">Abner Ravenwood</a>, later transferring to <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, where he earned an undergraduate degree in linquistics. In <a href="/wiki/1925" title="1925">1925</a>, he began a brief relationship with Ravenwood's daughter <a href="/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood" title="Marion Ravenwood">Marion</a>, which ended his friendship with Abner. Once a graduate, he briefly became an archaeology teacher in London where he met student <a href="/wiki/Deirdre_Campbell_Jones" title="Deirdre Campbell Jones">Deirdre Campbell</a>. Their romance led to marriage in <a href="/wiki/1926" title="1926">1926</a>, but a plane crash took Deirdre's life.
</p><p>In the years leading up to <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Jones secured a teaching position at <a href="/wiki/Marshall_College" title="Marshall College">Marshall College</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1936" title="1936">1936</a>, the US Government contracted him to find the Ark of the Covenant, which led him to be reunited with Marion Ravenwood. The relationship lasted until Jones left a week before their wedding. During the war, Jones joined the <a href="/wiki/OSS" title="OSS" class="mw-redirect">OSS</a> along with girlfriend Sophia Hapgood. The <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> brought the Soviets into competition as a new world power and Indy found himself the focal point of their quest for Akator. After Soviet agents kidnapped him, he agreed to help his son <a href="/wiki/Mutt_Williams" title="Mutt Williams">Mutt Williams</a> rescue his father figure and Indy's colleague Harold Oxley. Indy and Marion were reunited and their reconciliation finally led to marriage.
</p><p>Jones' lifetime of adventures eventually took its toll, as he lost an eye in the process and was forced to walk with a cane during his later years. By the early 1990s, he was living in the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> area with his daughter and grandchildren.

</p><p>When Henry Jr. had first learned to walk, he demonstrated this ability by somehow finding his way up the roof of the <a href="/wiki/Jones_house" title="Jones house">family house</a>, which forced his father had to climb up after him. By <a href="/wiki/1905" title="1905">1905</a>, young Henry had adopted the name of his beloved dog for himself<sup id="cite_ref-Ultimate_Guide_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ultimate_Guide-4">[5]</a></sup> (though his father would continue to refer to him as "Junior" well into his adult life<sup id="cite_ref-LC_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LC-5">[6]</a></sup>). At some point in 1905, Indy and his parents visited relatives in <a href="/wiki/New_Mexico" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and it was there that Indy rode on a pony - the first time he ever rode a horse, a talent he would eventually fully master.<sup id="cite_ref-Lost_Journal_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lost_Journal-6">[7]</a></sup> When Indy was seven years old he first developed a fascination for the bullwhip, when he saw a whip-act in a traveling circus.<sup id="cite_ref-raidersnovelization_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-raidersnovelization-7">[8]</a></sup> As a boy, Henry Jr. befriended future actor <a href="/wiki/Paul_Robeson" title="Paul Robeson">Paul Robeson</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>Henry was a curious and restless child, who often preferred to spend time with Indiana, play baseball with his friends, or conduct experiments instead of staying at school. At one time he tried to break the landspeed record, and at another point he tried to send his dog to the moon. Henry was a big fan of professional <a href="/index.php?title=Baseball&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Baseball (page does not exist)">baseball</a>, and his favorite team was the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Giants" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a>, while <a href="/wiki/Christy_Mathewson" title="Christy Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a> was his favorite player.

</p><p>Following the success of his books, Professor Jones was invited on a two year long <a href="/wiki/World_lecture_tour" title="World lecture tour">world lecture tour</a> of schools and universities. From <a href="/wiki/1908" title="1908">1908</a> to <a href="/wiki/1910" title="1910">1910</a>, "Indiana" and Anna were to accompany him on his travels around the globe.

Still living in the city of <a href="/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, Miss Seymour was introduced to the boy then declined Professor Jones' offer. She believed him too young. Nor did Indiana want to see any more of her. But Henry Sr. was determined for his son to have the best tutor he could get. Seymour eventually relented and the family began the two year stretch. It would be nine days of study before Indiana saw his first adventure.

<p>With Lawrence's supplies, the three camped at the base of the pyramid to see the night through. Indiana was fascinated by Lawrence's account of opening a tomb and suggested he'd like to be an <a href="/wiki/Archaeologist" title="Archaeologist">archaeologist</a>. Lawrence was happy to entertain the idea, but admonished the boy when Indiana brought up the possibility of becoming rich from the profession, encouraging him instead to see archaeology as something to be shared with the world. The conversation led to Lawrence inviting Indiana and Miss Seymour to join him on a trip near the <a href="/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Kings&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Valley of the Kings (page does not exist)">Valley of the Kings</a> where his friend <a href="/wiki/Rasheed_Sallam" title="Rasheed Sallam">Rasheed Sallam</a> was working on a dig site alongside <a href="/wiki/Howard_Carter" title="Howard Carter">Howard Carter</a>.
</p><p>Having acquired Professor Jones' permission and a <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones%27_journal" title="Indiana Jones' journal">thick journal</a> imparted to him to chronicle his journey, Indiana and his tutor accompanied Lawrence up the <a href="/index.php?title=Nile&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nile (page does not exist)">Nile</a> river the following day to reach their destination. The stretch would earn him another lesson as Lawrence showed him the importance of learning the language of any country he visits.
</p><p>Sallam greeted them on their arrival to the camp where they discovered work was stalling after word had spread that a curse had befallen the site following the recent excavation of a tomb belonging to the Ancient Egyptian architect/engineer known as <a href="/wiki/Kha" title="Kha">Kha</a>. Neither Sallam nor Carter entertained the notion of a curse, and Indiana was shown some of the artifacts that has been discovered in the area as part of Carter's desire to find the tomb of boy king <a href="/index.php?title=Pharaoh&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pharaoh (page does not exist)">Pharaoh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tutankhamun" title="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>.

</dd></dl>
<p>Carter allowed Indiana to be the first to enter Kha's tomb. Inside, they found the entrance to the burial chamber inscribed with a curse but pressed on and, when instructed, Sallam pried the door open to reveal a room scorched black surrounding the stone coffin of Kha. Lawrence suspected the room had already been searched when the coffin revealed no artifacts had been placed with the preserved corpse of Kha, and Duclos considered grave robbers but Carter was sure the door seals hadn't been broken and so there had to be another room. He was right, within the wall was secreted another chamber but poison gas was released so Indiana and the group had to abandon the search to seek fresh air and safety.
</p><p>To give the gas time to clear, Sallam was posted as a night watchman over the tomb's entrance and Indiana asked to help, but the man, while grateful, rejected the suggestion so Indiana retired for the evening. Sallam disappeared. Indiana joined the search the next day as the group re-entered the chambers and found that Kha was missing as well. Lawrence came across Sallam's charred body further on but deduced it was in fact a trauma to the head that killed the man. He was also covered in a unknown white powder. Collecting some, Lawrence couldn't see any motive so Indiana presented one person who might have an agenda: Kha.
</p><p>Demetrios and the workers fled the site in panic while Indiana, Lawrence and Miss Seymour decided to investigate the tomb further which led them to the secret chamber containing a statue of Kha and more inscription that revealed the Egyptian had been rewarded a jewel encrusted <a href="/wiki/Jackal_headpiece" title="Jackal headpiece">Jackal headpiece</a> by a Pharaoh for his services. Lawrence assumed that it was a part of the statue but Indiana told him it wasn't there. Closer inspection showed part had been broken off and Lawrence was sure they'd found the murderer's motive even if he couldn't understand where Kha himself went.

<p>The three ruled out the workers when Lawrence remembered the powder. By putting a flame to it, the puff of smoke that followed implied it was Duclos' flash powder. Indiana was woken the next morning by a hand clamped over his mouth. It was Lawrence, and he needed him stand guard while he searched Duclos' tent. Indiana kept an eye on the photographer walking through the site and followed him as Duclos went inside Kha's tomb. The camera flashed within the chambers and seeing Duclos may be heading back in his direction, Indiana ducked back inside an alcove. The wall behind creaked and he fell backwards into the upright body of Kha. The skeleton collapsed on top of him and, pinned to the floor, Indiana screamed fearing Duclos was coming to kill him.
</p><p>Lawrence and Miss Seymour rushed in. His tutor pushed the body off him as Lawrence held Duclos against the wall with his gun. Duclos proclaimed his innocence in the murder of Sallam and revealed he was taking pictures within the tomb for the newspaper story. Lawrence questioned the magnesium powder recovered from Sallam's corpse to which Duclos pointed out that he was not the only who used it. Indiana looked at Kha and found it clutching a detonator plunger, revealing Demetrios as having embellished the curse inscription so he could steal the Jackal. Inside the demolitionist's tent, the four found the box for the plunger and powder used in flares, evidence in proving Demetrios' guilt.
</p><p>Duclos lamented that the murderer and thief must be at the docks by that time, which Lawrence refused to believe. He quickly set out on his bicycle to intercept Demetrios while asking Indiana not to forget him, and promised to write.<sup id="cite_ref-COTJ_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COTJ-10">[11]</a></sup> Nevertheless, Indiana, Miss Seymour and Duclos followed and caught up to find Lawrence holding Demetrios. But Demetrios had hidden the artifact, and managed to flee the country soon after. Indiana and his tutor reunited with Professor and Anna Jones, departing Egypt for the next leg of the tour: <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-MFA_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MFA-3">[4]</a></sup>

Harris had arranged for the Joneses to meet with the <a href="/index.php?title=Sharifa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sharifa (page does not exist)">Sharifa</a> <a href="/wiki/Emily_Keene" title="Emily Keene">Emily Keene</a> and while the adults conversed, Indiana was allowed to play outside with Keene assigning <a href="/wiki/Omar_(slave)" title="Omar (slave)">Omar</a>, one of her slaves, to keep Jones company. During the game Indiana found he had to tell Omar not to let him win but complimented the boy on his English and discovered the boy didn't have to study like he. Jones considered the slave be lucky and Omar, like their game had been, accepted the point without argument.
</p><p>It was soon time for the family to move on to <a href="/index.php?title=Ouezzane&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ouezzane (page does not exist)">Ouezzane</a>, where Professor Jones was due to give a lecture for the Moroccan Sultan. Indiana was disappointed their game was being cut short and Anna was unable to tell him if he would have anyone to play with there too. Hearing this predicament, the Sharifa allowed Omar to be Jones' playmate for the rest of their stay in the country.

<p>For the seventy-five mile trip between cities, the boys talked. When Jones noted Morocco shared a similarity to Egypt, Omar, having never left the country, had to ask what that was. Jones explained which led to Indiana showing the slave his hand-drawn map and pointed out the countries and their differences in weather. The conversation brought up Jones' desire to be an archaeologist one day, another concept foreign to Omar. Indiana educated him further and asked what Omar was going to be. The slave replied that he would be just that, and was unable to abandon the role. It was with that that Indiana began to fully understand the concept.
</p><p>His growing concerns about the nature of slavery prompted a discussion on the subject when the travelers took a rest on the journey. Miss Seymour made it clear to him that Omar, with regards to the Sharifa, was for all intents and purposes property. It prompted Jones to decide to go and help his friend attend to the horses, and he let Omar know that as far he was concerned the boy wasn't a slave around him.
</p><p>The Joneses arrived in Ouezzane as guests in Harris' home. While Indiana was fetching something to eat, he spied a shrouded figure making his inside the building. Mistaking the man for a thief, the boy tried to rout him before he discovered the 'intruder' was none other than Harris himself. The journalist explained the Arab disguise allowed for easier movement around the marketplace, the natives less willing to confide in a European. His plans to meet with a grand vizier had been canceled having discovered the minister's severed head was on display for displeasing the sultan.
</p><p>Determined to see the head for himself, Indiana snuck out his Latin studies the moment his parents and teacher left the house. Ignoring the danger involved, he convinced Omar to join him and - Indy disguising himself like Harris had done - the pair headed for the busy marketplace. During their search, Indiana got distracted by a snake charming act and bumped into <a href="/index.php?title=Abdul&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Abdul (page does not exist)">one of the spectators</a>. The boys quickly returned to the search, unaware that the man had been alerted to the knowledge that they were traveling alone.
</p><p>They found the place where the vizier should be but no head. The very man Indiana had bumped into offered to show them where it was and led them down a deserted alley when his <a href="/index.php?title=One-Eyed_Brigand&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="One-Eyed Brigand (page does not exist)">one-eyed colleague</a> leapt out of hiding. Omar managed to flee but Jones was abducted.
</p><p>Bound and gagged within a small room, Indiana watched the slavers outside load <a href="/wiki/Camel" title="Camel">camels</a> with other children. He spied Omar sneaking to his rescue and managed to squeeze under the door to get his friend's attention. Omar undid the restraints but freedom, however, would be brief as the kidnappers caught the two as they made their escape. Indiana would get to experience the life of a slave first hand.
</p><p>The boys were loaded onto camels and taken far from the city. When the slavers set up camp to see the night through, Jones planned their escape. While most of the camp slept, the two tried to crawl their way to freedom. Suddenly the camp was assaulted by bandits and the slavers killed. Indiana mistook the attack for their salvation when in reality they were being stolen. The pair were loaded back onto the camels and taken all the way to <a href="/wiki/Marrakesh" title="Marrakesh">Marrakesh</a>, for Indiana would fetch a high price on the slave market.
</p><p>Herded with other slaves, the boys were paraded around the potential buyers. Separated from Omar, Indiana's turn came to be put on auction and his good health started a bidding war between a black robed stranger and a <a href="/wiki/Man_in_Yellow_Turban" title="Man in Yellow Turban">man in yellow turban</a>. The black robe eventually won out and Indiana was carried away to meet his new owner. Once again the figure unveiled himself to be Walter Harris, who had managed to track him to the city. Indiana was grateful for his rescue but discovered the journalist had no intention of saving Omar.
</p><p>Indiana refused to abandon his friend. Omar hadn't left him when he had the chance and Jones would do the same even if Omar would remain a slave regardless. Indiana and Harris returned to the auction just as bidding began on Omar. Harris was low on money — having spent most on Indiana — when he joined the bidding, and Harris' opponent from before saw it was the same man who had taken Jones from him. Another bidding war started but Jones quickly improvised, loudly protesting to his 'master' that Omar was mute. Since such an affliction would lower a slave's worth, Harris complained he did not want to pay so much for him. In response, the man in the yellow turban did not bid any further to force Omar onto his foe. As such, Harris won out and the three quickly left. The turban clad buyer followed and discovered he had been cheated. He sent men after them but the three escaped on horseback.
</p><p>With the Moroccan leg of the lecture over, the family returned to the Sharifa. Omar was to go back into the service of Keene so it was time for Indiana and his friend to say goodbye. Omar wished him luck on his quest to be an archaeologist and Indiana hoped he could one day show Omar the places he'd asked about. He decided to give Omar his map and, stopping Omar from bowing, the boys shook hands before going their separate ways. <sup id="cite_ref-MFA_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MFA-3">[4]</a></sup>

<p>In September, the Joneses arrived at a coffee plantation in British East Africa near Nairobi at the invitation of one of Professor Jones' old classmates, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Medlicot" title="Richard Medlicot">Richard Medlicot</a>. From there they were invited to go on safari with Former President <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, who was there to collect specimens for the <a href="/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" title="Smithsonian Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Selous" title="Frederick Selous">Frederick Selous</a>, the best game hunter in <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>. The family traveled with Medlicot to <a href="/wiki/Kirinyaga" title="Kirinyaga">Kirinyaga</a> via train. Medlicot even arranged for a special seat on the front of the locomotive so that the young Jones could watch the wildlife as they traveled.
</p><p>On the trip to the site, Indy was captivated by the beautiful countryside and its majestic animals. Upon arriving at camp, he hurriedly unpacked, anxious to meet his famous host. He was understandably disappointed when he found out that Roosevelt wouldn’t be back until nightfall. In the meantime, Medlicot showed Indy around the camp, introduced him to <a href="/wiki/Heller" title="Heller" class="mw-redirect">Heller</a>, a taxidermist, and other members of the expedition. Left on his own, Indy wandered outside of camp. While exploring, he glimpsed a young African boy roughly his own age tending <a href="/index.php?title=Sheep&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sheep (page does not exist)">sheep</a>. Before he had a chance to approach the boy, he was called back to camp.
</p><p>Indy arrived just in time to witness the arrival of his host, Teddy Roosevelt, and was suitably impressed. That evening, Roosevelt and company were wondering about the disappearance of <a href="/index.php?title=Burton&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Burton (page does not exist)">Burton</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Fringe-Eared_Oryx" title="Fringe-Eared Oryx" class="mw-redirect">Fringe-Eared Oryx</a>. Normally the animals should have been plentiful in the area, but not one had been spotted. Roosevelt was perplexed as he wished to bring a few specimens home for museums.
</p><p>The next day, Roosevelt taught Indy to shoot a rifle. He also gave him a pair of binoculars to explore the surrounding countryside. He then left to go hunting. Later in the day, as Miss Seymour was teaching Indy about African wildlife, he vowed to find the oryx for Roosevelt. As he was exploring around the camp, he encountered the young tribal boy again. This time, Indy used basic sign language to introduce himself as "Indy." The boy introduced himself as <a href="/wiki/Meto" title="Meto">Meto</a>. Indy spent the rest of the afternoon with Meto, exploring and learning Meto's language.

<p>Later that day, Indy and Roosevelt had a discussion. Indy was disturbed by the number of animals that the hunting party had already killed. Roosevelt told Indy that the animals were going to museums so that people could appreciate nature more. After dinner and over a game of checkers, Indy told Roosevelt that he would help him find the oryx. Their discussion gets interrupted by a shot. Frederick Selous had killed a <a href="/wiki/Lion" title="Lion">lion</a> that was roaming just outside of camp. While the adults congratulated each other, Indy became more disturbed.
</p><p>The next day, Indy was up early and went to Meto for help in finding the oryx. Back at camp, he was missed and a search commenced. Meto took Indy to the <a href="/wiki/Liabon" title="Liabon">Liabon</a> who, through pictures drawn in the sand, described the fate of the oryx. Indy headed back to camp. As night fell, he made his way across the veldt, becoming increasingly scared of the animal noises emanating from the dark. He was finally found by one of the <a href="/wiki/Askari" title="Askari">Askari</a> guards.
</p><p>Taken back to camp, Indy was punished and not given a chance to explain. Early the next morning, Meto came to camp and he and Indy left before anyone else was awake. Meto took Indy to a place where there were oryxes. Indy then sneaked back to camp before breakfast. Over breakfast, Indy announced that he and Meto had found a small heard of oryx. Indy related the story he heard from the village elder to Roosevelt. The oryx's main food source was a root melon. Recently, a great fire had killed off most of the area's snake population. The snakes had controlled the population of mole rats. With no natural predators, the mole rats flourished and burrowed underground for food, eating the root melons. This forced the oryx herd to look for food elsewhere.
</p><p>Indy led Roosevelt and a hunting party to where the oryx herd was grazing. The party brought down two when Indy interceded, stating that there had been enough killing. Roosevelt agreed, stating that the oryx were rare and that they didn’t know what animals may depend on the oryx. Their job completed, the hunting party packed up and headed back to civilization. Indy left Meto a goodbye gift of his binoculars.<sup id="cite_ref-PFL_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PFL-11">[12]</a></sup>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Miss_Seymour" title="Miss Seymour" class="mw-redirect">Miss Seymour</a> was showing Indy <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, "The City of Art." While in the <a href="/wiki/Louvre" title="Louvre">Louvre</a>, they met another boy, young fourteen-year-old <a href="/wiki/Norman_Rockwell" title="Norman Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a>. They looked at some paintings by <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Degas" title="Edgar Degas">Edgar Degas</a>, but Indy was unimpressed with impressionism. Afterwards, Miss Seymour took the boys to a puppet show which neither of them appreciated. They managed to convince her to let them stay for another show while she went back to the hotel to write letters. They promised to be back in one hour.
</p><p>Instead, Norman promised to take Indy to where the real artists hanged out. They went to a rather <a href="/wiki/Le_Lapin_Agile" title="Le Lapin Agile">disreputable-looking tavern</a> where many artist including Degas, <a href="/wiki/Pablo_Picasso" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> and <a href="/wiki/Georges_Braque" title="Georges Braque">Georges Braque</a> were currently having a heated discussion about cubism. Degas was critiquing the work of Picasso. He didn't like Picasso's work and called it destructive. Picasso said that artists need a new way of seeing things. Degas warned Picasso not pursue this new line of work as it could ruin his career. Picasso scoffed at the warning, saying he could do what Degas does in his sleep. Norman leaped to defend Degas, saying that no one can paint like him.

<p>Picasso invited Norman and Indy to his apartment to watch him prove his claim. There, Picasso posed his <a href="/wiki/Fernande_Olivier" title="Fernande Olivier">model</a> and worked in pastel. As he worked, he explained to the boys Degas' technique. When he was finished, he tossed it aside and did the painting the way Degas would do it - from memory. Braque showed Norman some of Picasso's early experiments with cubism. Norman sketched some of it in his notebook. Even though the assistant rendered some of the paintings, he said that it is the painting and not the painter that is important. Picasso finished the <a href="/wiki/Degas_painting" title="Degas painting">painting</a> and it indeed looked like a work of Degas'. Picasso saw the <a href="/wiki/Picasso_drawing" title="Picasso drawing">sketch</a> in Norman's notebook and signed it. They decided to go somewhere and get something to eat.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Miss Seymour was frantic wondering where Indy was. She called the police, but has little confidence in the police inspector she dealt with. Along their way to a restaurant, Picasso invited along a couple of prostitutes. Indy thought that he should be heading back to the hotel, but Norman convinced him to stay. Picasso had the two prostitutes dance with Norman and Indy while he tried to devise a way to get Degas to sign his painting.
</p><p>A little later, the prostitutes' pimps showed up and confronted Picasso. A fight broke out, but Picasso, Braque, Indy and Norman managed to make it out. Later, Picasso was helping Indy with a paper on Da Vinci that he had to write for Miss Seymour. They also talked about his new style and how Picasso was trying to give spirit some form. Before they parted for the night, Picasso invited them to a party the next evening. As Indy and Norman walked back to the hotel, they were accosted by the same two pimps, who chased them into a <a href="/wiki/Parisian_cemetery" title="Parisian cemetery">cemetery</a>. They managed to frighten them off by using an old sheet and a skull to make a "ghost."
</p><p>Back at the hotel, Indy sneaked past Miss Seymour and hid in the large wardrobe closet. The next morning, Miss Seymour found him there. Indy told her that he was there the whole time working on his paper and must have fallen asleep, but this only makes Miss Seymour more suspicious.
</p><p>The next night, Miss Seymour went to bed, but locked Indy in his room. He climbed out the window and was almost killed when the gutter he was hanging on gave way. He made it safely the rest of the way down and caught up to Norman outside the party. They went inside to find that everyone was wearing costumes. There, they met <a href="/wiki/Kahnweiler" title="Kahnweiler" class="mw-redirect">Kahnweiler</a>, an art dealer who wished to buy one of Picasso's cubist works. They were also introduced to <a href="/wiki/Gertrude_Stein" title="Gertrude Stein">Gertrude Stein</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alice_B._Toklas" title="Alice B. Toklas">Alice B. Toklas</a>. Picasso was able to persuade another painter, <a href="/wiki/Henri_Rousseau" title="Henri Rousseau">Henri Rousseau</a>, to tell a ghost story. At the story's climax, in walked Miss Seymour, who woke and discovered that Indy was gone, but had written down where he was going. Picasso pulled out a gun and marched Miss Seymour into another room. Once there, Picasso sketched her. She liked the traditional portrait he had done of her, but was totally impressed with the cubist version he did as well. Miss Seymour was also shown Picasso's forgery. Kahnweiler saw it and, unaware that it is a forgery, wanted to buy it for a thousand francs. Picasso acted reluctant and said that it is not signed. Kahnweiler said that he'd get it signed.
</p><p>At the cafe, Kahnweiler got Degas, whose eyesight had begun to fail him and thought it was one of his paintings, to sign the painting. A delighted Picasso let everyone know that it was he who painted the picture not Degas. Kahnweiler became angry. Norman and Indy, thinking the trick Picasso played on Degas was a rotten one, denied the claim. Norman said that it looked like a Degas and it was signed by Degas, so therefore it must be one. Indy then sold Kahnweiler Norman's cubist sketch for a thousand francs which infuriated Picasso. He split the money with Norman and Picasso. Indy told Picasso that maybe he should stay around Paris and become his agent.<sup id="cite_ref-PFL_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PFL-11">[12]</a></sup>

<p><a href="/wiki/Henry_Walton_Jones,_Senior" title="Henry Walton Jones, Senior">Professor Jones</a> had decided to attend the first <a href="/index.php?title=Psycho-Analytical_Conference&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Psycho-Analytical Conference (page does not exist)">Psycho-Analytical Conference</a> being held in <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>. The family was staying at the American Ambassador's residence. Indy was taking riding lessons with the children of some of the city's elite, among them the daughter of the Archduke <a href="/wiki/Franz_Ferdinand" title="Franz Ferdinand">Franz Ferdinand</a>, Princess <a href="/wiki/Sophie_von_Hohenberg" title="Sophie von Hohenberg">Sophie</a>. At one point she lost her hat, which Indy retrieved for her. He was rebuked by the instructor for his actions. Down in the stables, he introduced himself to her. She invited him along for a walk in the park, accompanied by <a href="/wiki/Miss_Seymour" title="Miss Seymour" class="mw-redirect">Miss Seymour</a> and her governess, <a href="/wiki/Emilie" title="Emilie">Emilie</a>.
</p><p>Afterwards, they went to eat at a rather expensive hotel. Indy and Sophie went for a stroll in the hotel's greenhouse. Looking outside, they could see people skating on a frozen lake. Sophie said she had never tried skating, so Indy convinced her to do so. However, as Indy began to show her the ropes, Emilie arrived and took her away, furious. Indy was in big trouble. When his father found out he went mad and withdrew him from his riding lessons. Indy's mother was a bit more sympathetic. She explained to him that the royal family had many enemies and what they did wasn't safe for Sophie. She told him that he'd make some other friends, but he responded that there was no one like her in the whole world.
</p><p>The next day during tutoring, Miss Seymour caught Indy writing an apology letter to Sophie. She began to teach Indy about poetry, particularly the works of <a href="/index.php?title=Byron&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Byron (page does not exist)">Byron</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Shelley&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Shelley (page does not exist)">Shelley</a>. Indy wondered if he could be in love. The following day, Indy received a letter from Sophie, in which she thanked him for the time they spent together. Indy's spirits were raised and he spent the day looking for a small gift to give her. In one shop, he saw the perfect gift - a small glass globe with two ice skating figurines inside. However, it cost too much. He continued to wander through the city, and eventually spoiled a con man's shell game by showing the victim how it was done. The grateful man gave Indy some money and it was enough for him to go back to the shop and buy the glass globe. However, when he went to the palace to give it to Sophie, he was chased away by the guards.
</p><p>That evening at dinner, the Joneses were joined by <a href="/wiki/Carl_Jung" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Adler" title="Alfred Adler">Alfred Adler</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, who got into a discussion about the role sexuality plays in the makeup of human nature. Indy asked about love and while the three men could not agree on what exactly it is, Freud told him he should not deny it, but shout it out.

<p>Later that night, Indy sneaked out of the embassy and went to the palace. He refused to leave until he got to talk to the Archduke. Ultimately, he was taken to see him. He told the Archduke that he wished to marry Sophie when older and would like to say good-bye to her before he left in the morning. While the Archduke admired Indy's determination, he refused. He then arranged for a carriage to take Indy back to the embassy.
</p><p>Once the carriage dropped him off, it headed back to the palace, but Indy had managed to hide himself aboard. At the palace stables, he came out of his hiding place and entered the palace. He sneaked through the halls, dodged the guards and used dumbwaiters and a discovered secret passage to get to Sophie's room. She was happy to see him and gave him a gift of a locket with her picture. Indy gave her the globe and told her that he was in love with her. They kissed briefly and he said good-bye. He climbed down the balcony and sneaked off the palace grounds as she waved goodbye. Jones would keep Sophie's locket for a long time, and he would later use it as a good luck-charm.<sup id="cite_ref-POC_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POC-12">[13]</a></sup>

<p>Indy and his family then travelled to <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> where they were staying with Professor and Senora Reale. They attended an opera written and conducted by <a href="/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini" title="Giacomo Puccini">Giacomo Puccini</a>. Anna was extremely moved by the love story of the opera and the beauty of the singing. Even Indy enjoyed it and began to wonder if love could be as powerful as it was portrayed in the opera. After the show, Indy and his father visited Puccini backstage who was resting with a towel over his face. Senora Reale asked Puccini if he would attend her dinner party, but he said he was too tired. However, when Puccini was introduced to Indy's mother, he was immediately taken by her beauty and said he would be honored to attend.
</p><p>At the party, Indy asked Puccini how he wrote the opera. Puccini told him he did it one note after the other. Indy told him that his mother enjoyed it so much that she cried. Puccini said that this meant that she understood great love. Indy told Puccini that they would be staying in Florence for a week while his father went to <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> to give a lecture. Indy told him he would be studying the laws of physics, specifically the laws of attraction. He said that the following day he would be going to <a href="/wiki/Pisa" title="Pisa">Pisa</a> to do an experiment just like <a href="/index.php?title=Galileo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Galileo (page does not exist)">Galileo</a>.

<p>The next day, Indy's father left for Rome, while Indy continued his studies of Physics with Miss Seymour. Puccini arrived a short while later and drove them to Pisa. Indy admired his motorized car and Puccini told him that <a href="/wiki/Leonardo_Da_Vinci" title="Leonardo Da Vinci" class="mw-redirect">Leonardo Da Vinci</a> was the first to invent the self-propelled car, not <a href="/index.php?title=Henry_Ford&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Henry Ford (page does not exist)">Henry Ford</a>. Indy and Miss Seymour climbed to the top of the <a href="/index.php?title=Leaning_tower_of_Pisa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Leaning tower of Pisa (page does not exist)">leaning tower of Pisa</a> with two irons, one heavier than the other. Miss Seymour asked him which will hit the ground first if they were to drop them both at the same time. Indy replied that the heavier one would. Miss Seymour told him that that was what <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> thought, but Galileo believed they would both hit the ground at the same time due to the fact that they had the same density. Indy proved this by dropping the weights which did indeed hit at the same time. Puccini asked Indy's mother about her life. He told her about how he came to realize that he was destined to write operas about love and beauty. He told her, however, that an artist can only create the approximation of beauty, never the real thing. He went on to tell her about the problems he has with his marriage.
</p><p>That night Indy's mother received a large bouquet of flowers from Puccini. She wrote a letter to her husband and had it mailed. A few days later, they attended a rehearsal of Puccini's new opera, <a href="/index.php?title=Madame_Butterfly&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Madame Butterfly (page does not exist)">Madame Butterfly</a>, and witnessed an argument between Puccini and one of the singers. Puccini told them that a singer alone could not portray his emotions; he needed an actress also. Puccini gave Indy's mother a piece of the sheet music from the opera signed, "To Senora Jones, who feels the music." He then offered to show them around Florence tomorrow. That night Indy's mother explained to him how music is a special language that can convey a wide range of emotions. The next day, Indy's mother enjoyed the guided tour of Florence. While alone, Puccini confessed to Indy's mother that he felt that they were connected and should be together, however, she told him that she was married and no matter what her feelings were for him, they must speak no further of it. She asked him to take them back to the house.
</p><p>The following day at breakfast, Indy asked his mother what was bothering her. She seemed upset that she hadn't received a reply from his father in the mail. Indy told her that he’d be back the following night. They decided to go sight seeing on their own that day, however, Puccini tracked them down. Miss Seymour steered Indy away from them so his mother and Puccini could speak in private. Puccini apologized to her, but said he could not stay away. He said he wanted to work with her in his sight because she had revitalized his passion. She was extremely distraught over the feelings she had for him and asked to be left alone. Indy interrupted them as he realized something was going on. Puccini asked her to meet him in the botany gardens that evening. She refused, but he said he would wait until she came.
</p><p>That evening, Indy's mother left him and Miss Seymour to take a walk. She met Puccini in the garden and they kissed passionately. They spent the evening walking together throughout Florence. They arrived back at the opera house where Puccini's play was opening. The play was a success and he walked her back to the house. Miss Seymour spotted them from her window as they kissed. Miss Seymour confronted her when she came inside and asked if she was still planning on leaving Florence for Paris when Professor Jones returned. She said yes, but was obviously still considering staying. The next day, Indy and Miss Seymour were visiting the science museum while his mother went shopping. Indy said that he had noticed that his mother had been acting strange which she didn’t seem to do when his father was around. He wished that his father had written his mother a letter. Looking through a telescope at the street below he spotted his mother having lunch with Puccini. Puccini asked Anna to come away with him. She said it was too fast, but he told her that the train leaves at midnight. She ran from him in confusion.
</p><p>That night Indy asked his mother about her "shopping" earlier that day and asked if she saw Puccini. She said she ran into him while shopping. Indy went to bed and Anna began crying. Miss Seymour tried to comfort her, but she explained how confused she was concerning Puccini. She told Miss Seymour that Puccini wanted her to go away with him as Indy listened at the door to his room. She told Miss Seymour that she did love him, but Miss Seymour warned her that passion always burns brightest at first and that Puccini had no right to ask her to give up everything for him. Anna admitted that she did still love her husband and didn't want to think of leaving him or Indy, but she was electrified when she was with Puccini. That night Anna went to the train station and walked past Puccini to greet her husband. She told him how much she had missed him and told him she wanted to always stay together. Puccini walked away heartbroken.<sup id="cite_ref-POC_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POC-12">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>During <a href="/wiki/1909" title="1909">1909</a>, for his tenth birthday, Indy was given an archery set by his father. Henry put up a target, and told Indy to practice, and said that when he got a bulls-eye he'd go and tell him. Indy practiced the whole afternoon, and when Henry came out to see how it all had went, Indy told him that he simply couldn't hit it. Henry then told him that the problem was that he didn't believe that he could hit it. Indy told himself that he could do it, and as a result he hit the target. Henry's lesson was to teach Indy not to become cynical.<sup id="cite_ref-Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade_novel_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade_novel-13">[14]</a></sup> Indy's michievous nature would also manifest itself during the family's travels, such as in <a href="/wiki/St._Petersburg" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> when he painted a statued pig purple, and in <a href="/wiki/Murmansk" title="Murmansk">Murmansk</a> where he made a moose get stuck in an outhouse.<sup id="cite_ref-TWF_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TWF-14">[15]</a></sup>

<p>During <a href="/wiki/1910" title="1910">1910</a>, Indy and his family were staying in <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> with friends of his father's who invited them to their daughter's wedding. Indy tried to behave himself and enjoy the wedding at the same time, but failed to do so. He leaned against a cart with crystal on it which sent it crashing into a passing waiter. Indy's father took him out into the hall to reprimand him. He told Indy that he was to stand in the hall and not move, however, Indy disobeyed him. As he walked into an adjoining room, he brushed against a handle attached to the rope a huge chandelier was hanging from. The handle came unlocked and the chandelier crashed down onto the wedding cake. Indy's parents looked on in disbelief and his mother brought him to his room. Indy apologized to his mother, but she told him that his father would deal with him in the morning. Indy, feeling he was being treated unfairly, climbed down a gutter drain outside his window and ran away.
</p><p>The next morning, Miss Seymour woke Indy's parents to tell them that Indy was gone. Indy's father began to search for him. Indy, sleeping in a haystack, was awoken by a small weasel. He tried to shoot it with his slingshot, but hit <a href="/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" title="Leo Tolstoy">an old man</a> who was also sleeping in the haystack. The old man advanced on him swinging a stick and yelling in Russian. Indy said that he didn't speak Russian, so the man started yelling at him in English. The man said how he hated young people and walked off with Indy's slingshot. Indy followed him trying to get his slingshot back. The man told him to stop following him, but Indy refused. The man gave him back his slingshot and told him to get off his side of the road.

<p>Indy walked with the old man (on his side of the road) and explained how he was running away back to America. When Indy questioned why the man didn't want to turn Indy into his parents the man said that he never did what he was supposed to do and he was also running away. Indy didn't believe him because he was old. The man asked him if he thought only little boys were driven crazy by their parents.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Indy's parents were getting extremely worried about him. Indy asked the man if he was going to miss anyone. The man said he would miss his dogs. Indy said he missed his dog also. Indy's sole came off his boot and the man said he'll fix it. The man showed Indy his prize possession, his bible. Indy showed him his baseball mitt and ball. He explained to him the basics of the game and showed him his baseball card collection. Indy said he wouldn't give up his prize card for all of the gold in China. The man said he felt the same way about his bible.
</p><p>With Indy's boot fixed, the two continued on their way. They began to feel hungry and Indy started eating the apple he brought with him. He offered the man one bite, but the man managed to eat half of the apple with his one bite. Indy complained, but the man told him that things should be divided each according to his needs. Since he was bigger than Indy, he required more. Indy stated that it was his apple, but the man said that it grew on a tree in the ground and belonged to the world. Indy said he would never share anything with him again.
</p><p>The two continued on in silence as it began to thunder. Indy's father said that he should never have brought Indy along on his trip through Europe. Indy and the man reached a village and the villagers rushed to great the man yelling, "Tolstoy!" Indy was amazed at how friendly the people were to Tolstoy. The villagers welcomed "Count" Tolstoy into their inn and gave him food to eat. Indy watched from the window as rain began to pour down on him. Tolstoy yelled at him to get inside and stop making him feel guilty. Once Indy finished the meal he asked if Tolstoy was some kind of king in disguise. Tolstoy told him that he wrote a few books years ago, but they weren't very good. He told Indy that he was running away to nowhere in particular. He just wanted a simpler life, closer to God. Indy told him he can run away to New Jersey with him and Tolstoy agreed.
</p><p>The Russian police arrived looking for Tolstoy and told him they were here to take him back to his family. Indy flipped the table up and knocked down the police. In the confusion, he and Tolstoy escaped. Indy's father became increasingly worried about the dangers that Indy might have encountered and blamed himself for Indy running away. As Indy and Tolstoy hid in a barn, they watched as Imperial Cossack troops rode by. Tolstoy told him that they were ruthless and were used by the government to rid themselves of "certain unfortunate ethnic groups." Indy finally placed the name "Tolstoy" and asks if he was the author of <i><a href="/index.php?title=War_and_Peace&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="War and Peace (page does not exist)">War and Peace</a></i>. Indy said his father thinks he is great, but Tolstoy said his father is an imbecile.
</p><p>Tolstoy said they should head for the train station. On the way, they stopped so Indy could teach Tolstoy about baseball. Indy said it's too bad Tolstoy wasted all those years writing because he could have been a great hitter. A group of gypsies passed by and gave the two of them a ride. That night, Tolstoy told everyone a scary story around the campfire. While they all danced around the campfire, the Cossacks attacked, killing many of the gypsies. Tolstoy was knocked down by a Cossack on a horse, but Indy rescued him. The two fled as the camp was set on fire.
Indy brought Tolstoy to a church, but the monk tries to throw them out thinking they were beggars. Indy told him that the man was Tolstoy and they tried to help him. As Tolstoy awoke he realized where he was and ran out. He told Indy that they drove people away from God and he'd sooner die than receive help from them. Tolstoy fell unconscious in a field nearby and Indy screamed for help. Some men heard him and brought Tolstoy inside their house.
The next day, Indy asked Tolstoy why he hated the church so much. He said that they diminished God by claiming to speak for him. He told Indy not to try to see God through spectacles borrowed from the church, but instead through his own eyes. Meanwhile, Miss Seymour wasn't feeling well from all of the worry. Indy's father just wished he could talk to him and began crying.
</p><p>Indy and Tolstoy arrived at the train station just as the train left. Indy noticed that Tolstoy was not doing too well. He told him that he didn't think he was up to the trip. Tolstoy got angry as Indy told him that he thought he should return to his family. Tolstoy agreed to go as long as Indy would return to his family as well. Indy's father and mother were looking in on Miss Seymour who was bedridden when a hotel clerk knocked at the door to tell them that Indy had been found. Indy's mother made his father promise that he wouldn’t be too hard on him.
Indy's parents arrived at Tolstoy's estate and were reunited with Indy. Indy apologized for running away. Before he could accept, Indy's father spotted Tolstoy and was amazed. Indy introduced his parents to Tolstoy. After they left, Tolstoy went inside to rest. Indy's mother askd where Indy got the bible he had. Indy said he traded Tolstoy his baseball card collection for it. Tolstoy took out the baseball cards and enthusiastically read through them. Indy and his parents left Russia for <a href="/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>. While on the train, Professor Jones blamed him for Miss Seymour's condition. Indy said he hated his father.<sup id="cite_ref-TWF_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TWF-14">[15]</a></sup>

<p>Upon reaching the site of <a href="/wiki/Aristotle%27s_theater" title="Aristotle's theater">Aristotle's theater</a>, Indy's father gave instructions to the cab driver in ancient Greek, but Indy wasn't sure that he understood properly. Indy's father told Indy that this was the birthplace of Philosophy and explained to him the fundamentals of it. He told him of Aristotle's teachings of logic in a system called syllogism. He demonstrated by using a stick as a sword and acting out a fight. He fell to the floor seemingly dead. As Indy rushed to his side, he jumped up and said that all men are mortal which is a general truth. He is a man, ergo he is mortal which is a specific truth. He then said that <a href="/wiki/Socrates" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> was a man, ergo Socrates was mortal which is a syllogism. This, he told Indy, was an example of Aristotelian logic and that deductive logic is the key that will unlock the great mysteries of our universe and our very existence. The questions that <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> asked marked a turning point in the history of mankind. These thoughts set us apart from all the other creatures in the world.
</p><p>They then went to leave, but Indy found that the cab was gone. His father pointed to a cab and said that that is logically their cab. Their cab was parked there; this cab was parked there now; ergo that was their cab. They got in the cab and took off. They soon realized that the driver was not the same and they were kicked out of the cab. They began trekking to the monastery on foot. On the way, Indy's father continued to lecture to Indy about the ancient Greeks.
</p><p>Eventually a horse and buggy approached and they managed to get a ride. Indy's father tried to continue lecturing over the sounds of the chickens in the buggy and another <a href="/wiki/Pan_Pipe_Player" title="Pan Pipe Player">rider's wind flute</a>. They were dropped off still far away from the monastery looking completely disheveled. They bathed in the ocean to clean up, however, a group of goats ate holes in their clothes. They arrived in a nearby village wearing nothing, but pieces of a bush and managed to get some very "native" looking clothes from the peasants. They managed to get a lift from a man named Aristotle whose donkey pulling the cart was named <a href="/wiki/Plato_(donkey)" title="Plato (donkey)">Plato</a>.
</p><p>Aristotle asked Indy's father if he was interested in politics. When his father said no, Aristotle called him an idiot. Indy was shocked, however, his father explained that the English word "idiot" comes from a Greek word meaning "one who is not interested in politics." Indy's father and Aristotle soon got into an argument about democracy. Indy's father said that Greece was the home of democracy. He explained Plato and Aristotle's system of government. The three began getting confused about what they were arguing about since Indy's father was constantly talking about what Aristotle and Plato said and the driver kept thinking he was talking about him and his donkey. Aristotle kicked Indy's father, "the raving democrat," out of the buggy. Indy's father walked alongside while Indy refused to get out of the cab. He said that if this was really a democracy like his father argued then he could stay in the cab if he wanted to.
</p><p>They eventually arrived at the hanging monastery which was situated at the top of a mountain and got into a cage which would be raised up the side of the mountain by the monks above. On the trip up Indy noticed the height was bothering his father who was sitting completely still. They were greeted by the monks and told that the following day the monks would be cloistered and would keep a vow of silence for the following two days.
After dinner, they were shown to their room which was basically a closet with one hard bed. The next day, Indy watched the monks as they chanted. He then went to the library and tried to keep quiet while his father translated texts. He told his father that he was bored. His father's solution was to make Indy look up Aristotle's laws of syllogism and write three pages on the nature of Aristotelian logic and its relation to causality. Indy found the books his father referred him to and began to read through them.
</p><p>Indy met <a href="/wiki/Nikos_Kazantzakis" title="Nikos Kazantzakis">Nikos Kazantzakis</a> was also studying the texts at the monastery. He looked at the assignment Indy's father gave him and decided to help him out. He explained that Aristotle said that nature does not act without a cause; which sprang from his theory of causality. He demonstrated this by having Indy give a push to an orange set atop some books. He stated that there were many factors that caused the orange to fall: the essence of the orange (its weight), the structure of the orange (it is round), the fact that Indy pushed it, and finally, that it's function included seeking the lowest level. Indy interpreted this last factor to be gravity, but Nikos said that the function of the orange is to fall from the tree to make another orange. Indy wrote in his paper what Nikos explained him, but he asked what causes nature? Nikos said that this is a question that comes from wisdom and not logic. He said that this is the question that Indy's father wanted him to find. He said God, the prime cause, dances beyond the bounds of logic.

<p>Later in the day, Indy and his father said goodbye to the monks at the elevator cage. The monks headed off to begin their vow of silence and Indy gave his father his report. They boarded the cage and began to be lowered down. Indy's father read the report on the way down and said it was good although he didn't agree that wisdom is greater than logic. The cage stopped and Indy's father stepped out to find that they were only halfway down. He managed to grab hold of the cage as he fell and climbed back in. Indy began to suspect the worst, thinking that the monks had stranded them there so they would starve to death. They yelled for help, however, no one answered. The sun began to set and the temperature starts dropping. They started a small fire using pieces of wood from the cage, however the cage itself caught on fire. While trying to put out the fire, Henry accidentally broke a hole in the floor of the elevator.
</p><p>The next morning, they began to doubt that the monks would find them and tried to devise a plan on how to save themselves. Indy's father attempted to climb up the rope that the cage was hanging from, but only got a few feet before his fear of heights froze him in place. He slid back down the rope and burned his hands in the process. The rope then began to fray. Indy said they needed to be logical to get out of the predicament. He reasoned a ladder is made of wood and the cage was made of wood; ergo their cage was a ladder. They broke off pieces of wood and rope and made individual ladder rungs that could be fastened to the rope above and then unfastened once they had climbed above each rung. Indy's father made it past the part of the rope that was fraying and barely managed to grab hold of Indy and the rope snapped and the cage plummeted to the ground. They reached the top of the mountain cliff and found that the monk working the pulley controlling the cage was knocked unconscious when the pulley fell from the roof. Indy and his father laughed as the tension was released and shared a hug. Relieved that their ordeal was over, the two traveled back to Athens, deciding not to share the details of the adventure with Anna and Miss Seymour, but exclaiming through a syllogism that they had a great time together as father and son.<sup id="cite_ref-TWF_14-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TWF-14">[15]</a></sup>

<p>They sat out with their guide <a href="/wiki/Li_Shung_Sui" title="Li Shung Sui">Mr. Li</a>. On the train, Miss Seymour was tutoring Indy in Chinese history when he noticed a suspicious looking Chinese man looking into their compartment. The man moved along when he noticed that Indy saw him. They first visited a Buddhist temple and then the <a href="/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China" title="Great Wall of China">Great Wall</a>. Afterwards, they took a barge to their next destination.
On board, Mrs. Jones and Miss Seymour discussed the possibility of seeing the birthplace of <a href="/index.php?title=Confucius&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Confucius (page does not exist)">Confucius</a>. Mr. Li told them that the journey would be long and hard, but they insisted. While Miss Seymour was quizzing Indy, he told her that he thought it was more important to learn a country's language and culture than its history. He also saw the same suspicious man again and told Mr. Li. Mr. Li said that it was probably a coincidence. Indy wondered if it could be one of those revolutionaries that did not like foreigners that he heard his father talk of.
</p><p>Later that evening at the inn, Mr. Li was explaining Chinese philosophy to Mrs. Jones and Miss Seymour, when Indy thought he saw the mysterious man again. He didn't say anything to the adults. The next day, they hired a wagon for the journey. The driver, <a href="/wiki/Ah_Pin" title="Ah Pin">Ah Pin</a>, only spoke <a href="/index.php?title=Pidgin_English&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pidgin English (page does not exist)">pidgin English</a>. Along the way, Mr. Li instructed Indy in the Chinese language. He showed Indy how inflection was important and could change the meaning of a word.
</p><p>Indy complained of a headache. While the adults were away, Indy saw the suspicious looking man around the cart. The man told Ah Pin that Mr. Li was looking for him. He then tried to steal the wagon, but Indy had unhitched the horses. Mr. Li threatened the suspicious man and then sent him on his way. Mr. Li then told Indy not to mention the incident to the women. Ah Pin would lose face if it were revealed he was tricked. He told Indy that he acted well and didn't need the approval of others. They got new horses and proceeded on their trip.
</p><p>As they continued across the country in the wagon, Indy started to become sicker and was soon running a fever. Storm clouds started to gather and they decided to head for a nearby mission. The rain continued to come down as Indy's condition worsened. Eventually, they came to a river that they had to cross. Halfway across, the horses were frightened and bolted, overturning the cart. Everyone got to shore, but their luggage was all washed downstream.
</p><p>They made their way through the rain to a farmhouse. The family welcomed them in and they quickly tried to get Indy warm and dry. They told Mrs. Jones that the nearest American doctor was three days away at the mission, but there was a local Chinese doctor. Mrs. Jones didn't trust the local doctor. The next day, Mr. Li told them that even though the family is poor, they were glad to host them until Indy was better. Hospitality was very important to the Chinese. Indy's condition continued to worsen. They managed to get the cart fixed, but Indy was too sick to travel. Ah Pin and Miss Seymour sat out to the American mission for the doctor. A delirious Indy asked his mother if he was going to die, just like his sister did when she was little. She told him no.

<p>The next day, they witnessed an altercation between the family's father and a <a href="/index.php?title=Chinese_Debt_Collector&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Chinese Debt Collector (page does not exist)">man on a donkey</a>. Their attention was diverted when Indy threw a fit. Mr. Li said that there were still two days until the doctor arrived. That evening the family prayed for Indy. Mrs. Jones was determined that their son was not going to die and sent for the Chinese doctor. He arrived the next day and examined Indy. He decided that Indy had to be treated with acupuncture. A delirious Indy became upset and this bothered his mother. The Chinese mother tried to comfort her. Mrs. Jones held Indy's hand throughout the procedure and told him to trust in the doctor. As he applied the needles, <a href="/wiki/Wen_Ch-Iu" title="Wen Ch-Iu">Dr. Wen Ch-Iu</a> explained what he was doing. Mr. Li translated for him. When he was done, he said that Indy would recover if his strength would hold.
</p><p>Miss Seymour arrived with <a href="/wiki/James_Morton" title="James Morton">Dr. James Morton</a> from the mission. He was very pleased to meet Dr. Wen Ch-Iu, one of the few local physicians who he didn't consider a quack. Morton said that Indy probably had Typhoid Fever, but was getting better. Ah Pin also found some of their luggage. As Indy regained his strength, he spent time playing Chinese checkers with the children and learning their language. A few days later, the man on the donkey returned. Mr. Li explained that the father had to borrow money and used the land as collateral. The debt was now due, but he couldn't pay. Mrs. Jones decided to pay the debt out of gratitude, but Mr. Li said that the father would lose face. She said that she owed them something for all of their hospitality. She gave him the money, which he gave to the debt collector. She also bought the family some <a href="/index.php?title=Chicken&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Chicken (page does not exist)">chickens</a> and they had a small feast before leaving to continue their journey.<sup id="cite_ref-JOR_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-JOR-2">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>While journeying to meet Professor Jones in <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, Indiana came across bride <a href="/wiki/Yang_Wei" title="Yang Wei">Yang Wei</a> close to his age with eyes red from crying. Shocked to find out from interpreter <a href="/wiki/Lin_Feng" title="Lin Feng">Lin Feng</a> that she was due to be wed so young, and to a man so much older, he took the first opportunity he could to create a distraction in the market and run away with the confused girl. Jones returned with her to the inn at which he was staying to hide and the pair — despite neither speaking the other's language — were introduced formally.
</p><p>As Jones began planning a way for Yang Wei to escape, they were interrupted by an angry Miss Seymour ready to take the girl back. Indiana protested, but Lin Feng advised the boy of the difference in their cultures and he helped translate for Yang Wei to reveal that she was crying not for being made to marry an older man, who was both gentle and prosperous, but was simply sad to be leaving her family.
</p><p>At Miss Seymour's request, Jones returned with Yang Wei to the market and the bride gave him the gift of a small Buddha statue she wore around her neck to mark their friendship.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[17]</a></sup>

<p>In Utah, Indy kept busy as a member of the Boy Scouts, having achieved the rank of "Life Scout." One expedition, led by scout leader <a href="/wiki/Havelock" title="Havelock">Havelock</a>, was a planned overnight in Arches National Park.

However, Indy and his friend <a href="/wiki/Herman_Mueller" title="Herman Mueller">Herman Mueller</a> accidentally stumbled upon a band of thieves, led by a man called <a href="/wiki/Garth" title="Garth">Fedora</a>, who were looting the caves.

<p>Professor Jones' studies led to the pair traveling the world once more. As a consequence of his father's lectures and increasing searches into Grail lore, Indiana found himself on adventures with various people. In one of his first meetings with <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Brody" title="Marcus Brody">Marcus Brody</a>, a friend of his father's, Indy joined him in his hunt for archaeological artifacts in Egypt. At the <a href="/wiki/Great_Pyramid" title="Great Pyramid">Great Pyramid</a> of Giza, Indy met <a href="/wiki/Sallah_Mohammed_Faisel_el-Kahir" title="Sallah Mohammed Faisel el-Kahir">Sallah Mohammed Faisel el-Kahir</a> for the first time. Together, Jones and Sallah found <a href="/index.php?title=Ring_of_Osiris&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ring of Osiris (page does not exist)">a valuable ring</a> from the not-yet-officially-discovered tomb of King <a href="/wiki/Tutankhamun" title="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>. In the process, they also foiled a plot by archaeologist <a href="/wiki/Gustav_von_Trappen" title="Gustav von Trappen">Gustav von Trappen</a> to use the <a href="/index.php?title=Valley_of_the_Kings&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Valley of the Kings (page does not exist)">Valley of the Kings</a> as a storage bunker for German weapons in a future war, and narrowly escaped the last major outbreak of the bubonic plague.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[29]</a></sup>
</p><p>In August, Jones visited the monastery of Tsadong in the Himalayas where the child Lama was removed and sequestered. To save his new friend, Indy took on those known to the Buddhists as harmful demons.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[30]</a></sup>
</p><p>The summer ended with a brief jaunt to St. Petersburg, Russia and a meeting with the hereditary Georgian princess, <a href="/index.php?title=Tamar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tamar (page does not exist)">Tamar</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[31]</a></sup> Afterward Indy rejoined his father in <a href="/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Armenia (page does not exist)">Armenia</a> (his father was on a side trip studying the Crusades). Later, in October, Indy found himself in <a href="/wiki/Charenton_Academy" title="Charenton Academy">a boarding school</a> in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> while his father lectured at <a href="/index.php?title=Cambridge_University&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cambridge University (page does not exist)">Cambridge University</a>. This did nothing to slow down Indy's adventures, however. Between a corrupt mine owner, a ring that may have belonged to the court of <a href="/wiki/Artorius" title="Artorius">King Arthur</a> and the mystique of Samhaim (All Hallow's Eve), Indy had little trouble filling in the time between classes.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[32]</a></sup>
</p><p>The same year, while on a desert hike with his father, Indy met a Navajo medicine man called <a href="/wiki/Changing_Man" title="Changing Man" class="mw-redirect">Changing Man</a>, who took a liking to him, and told him that they would meet again.<sup id="cite_ref-IJatPaD_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IJatPaD-32">[33]</a></sup>
</p><p>In December, Indy and his boarding school pal, <a href="/wiki/Herman_Mueller" title="Herman Mueller">Herman Mueller</a>, aided <a href="/wiki/Herman_Mueller,_Sr." title="Herman Mueller, Sr." class="mw-redirect">Herman's father</a> on a research trip to <a href="/wiki/Stonehenge" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>. They soon discovered that someone was trying to sabotage the dig as they were confronted by a magic-wielding German spy. Indy and Herman barely escaped injury with some questionable help from the ancient stones themselves and the power of the rising sun focused through the saboteur's magic crown.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[34]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="/wiki/1914" title="1914">1914</a> started with Indy being allowed to travel to London for one last vacation before returning to school. While there, Indy discovered (through a bit of misfortune) that an ancient Greek bowl was a forgery. Indy and his father then traveled back to Greece in search of the stolen artifact.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[35]</a></sup>
</p><p>Later, Indy discovered the power of an Italian curse placed upon a cross made from the sword hilt of a Norman warrior. He helped his old friend <a href="/wiki/Lizzie_Ravenall" title="Lizzie Ravenall" class="mw-redirect">Lizzie Ravenall</a> locate the cross while on break in New York City.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[36]</a></sup>
</p><p>Back in Utah in May, Indy's school burned down, ending the year early. Making sure that Indy didn't lose out in his studies, his father sent him off with a graduate assistant to southern France. The goal of their trip was to find a letter from King <a href="/index.php?title=Louis_IX&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Louis IX (page does not exist)">Louis IX</a>, sent before the king's second crusade. Instead they found a jewel-encrusted crown stolen by Louis from a gypsy tribe.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[37]</a></sup>
</p><p>Immediately after his escapade in France, Indy was dragged to <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople" class="mw-redirect">Constantinople</a> as his father pursued the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Grail" title="Holy Grail">Holy Grail</a>. Also joining him was Herman Mueller and together they investigated the trail of <a href="/wiki/Knife_of_Cain" title="Knife of Cain">a knife</a> believed to be linked to the legend of <a href="/index.php?title=Cain&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cain (page does not exist)">Cain</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Abel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Abel (page does not exist)">Abel</a>. The Joneses left Turkey following the adventure when Indy's father heard of the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in <a href="/index.php?title=Sarajevo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sarajevo (page does not exist)">Sarajevo</a> as the professor was concerned that the European political climate was leading to war.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[38]</a></sup>
</p><p>Sometime during the latter half of 1914, Indy and his father moved back to Princeton.<sup id="cite_ref-Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade_novel_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade_novel-13">[14]</a></sup>Indy then spent the remainder of his summer break working as a coal shoveler on a train.<sup id="cite_ref-PTOD_38-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PTOD-38">[39]</a></sup> Indy also ran errands for <a href="/wiki/Hobey_Baker" title="Hobey Baker">Hobey Baker</a> at Princeton University.
</p><p>In October, far from the problems in Europe, the Joneses traveled to China in search of more Grail clues. However, in <a href="/wiki/Honolulu" title="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, one of their stopovers on the way, the war caught up. Indy's adventure in Honolulu pitted him against a very active volcano and a German agent intent on killing a British professor.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[40]</a></sup>

<p>Once they finally left Honolulu, they still encountered troubles as their steamer was intercepted by a Japanese naval vessel. Indy discovered soon after that someone had smuggled a golden Chinese dragon statuette in his luggage, which he hid from the Japanese inspectors. Once they reached the mainland, the statuette became the object of a desperate hunt by Chinese, Japanese and German factions.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[41]</a></sup>
</p><p>In December, Indy and his father traveled to India where he met and befriended Prince <a href="/index.php?title=Kasim&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kasim (page does not exist)">Kasim</a>. The royal guard told Indy and Kasim not to touch the ancient tiger's-eye amulet, but Kasim refused to listen and began wearing it around his neck. When a tiger was seen stalking the area, Indy noticed that Kasim had mysteriously disappeared. He began to wonder if his friend could have changed into the dreaded legendary beast - the weretiger. Indy sat out to find the answer and save his friend from the curse of the amulet.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[42]</a></sup>
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1915" title="1915">1915</a>, Indy spent another summer break working as a coal shoveler on a train. During this time Indy became a self-proclaimed expert on trains.<sup id="cite_ref-PTOD_38-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PTOD-38">[39]</a></sup>

<p>February <a href="/wiki/1916" title="1916">1916</a> had Indy, now a junior in high school in <a href="/wiki/Princeton" title="Princeton">Princeton</a>, looking forward to taking <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Stratemeyer" title="Nancy Stratemeyer">Nancy Stratemeyer</a> to the prom in her father's car - a beautiful Bugati. Of course, his rival <a href="/index.php?title=Butch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Butch (page does not exist)">Butch</a> didn’t believe him, so it had become a matter of pride. He was crushed when Nancy came to <a href="/index.php?title=Harper%27s_Ice_Cream_Parlor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Harper's Ice Cream Parlor (page does not exist)">Harper's Ice Cream Parlor</a> where he worked after school and told him that the car was broken.

Indy went to see Nancy's father, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Stratemeyer" title="Edward Stratemeyer">Edward Stratemeyer</a> (who would later become the author of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books). He was able to talk Mr. Stratemeyer into letting him take the car to a local garage. There, Indy was told that the generator would have to be rebuilt and the only place to get that done was in New York.

<p>That night, Indy's father had dinner guests. One of them was a <a href="/index.php?title=Dr._Thompson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dr. Thompson (page does not exist)">Dr. Thompson</a>, a researcher at Edison Laboratories. He was working on a battery that would run a car. Such an invention could put the oil companies out of business. Later in the evening, Indy asked him if he could fix the Bugati's generator. He said that he could and invited Indy to the labs in East Orange.
</p><p>The next day Indy and Nancy loaded their bikes onto a train and journeyed to East Orange. When they arrived at the laboratory, Indy's eyes lit up when he saw a car whipping around a test track. Thompson took the generator into one of the labs to an assistant. While Indy was talking to the test car driver, a cry came from the lab. Indy and Nancy rushed inside to find that Thompson had been kidnapped by three men in a van. They also knocked out his assistant and stole some plans. The police arrived and the officer in charge was a <a href="/index.php?title=Captain_Frank_Brady&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Captain Frank Brady (page does not exist)">Captain Frank Brady</a>. The assistant told Brady that the kidnappers were speaking German and he repeated the phrase that he heard. Brady translated it as "Quick, the baby's burping," Indy suggested that it might have been "Quick, the chicken is burping," but that made no sense either. Brady told Indy to butt out and that he wouldn’t get the generator back until after the case was solved. <a href="/index.php?title=Edison&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Edison (page does not exist)">Edison</a> arrived and the assistant told him that certain Naval Research files on a submarine detection system and the files on the car battery had been stolen. Edison was more concerned with the stolen files than with Thompson's well being. Edison told Brady to contact Naval Intelligence.
</p><p>As Indy and Nancy walked their bikes back to the train station, Indy realized that the German phrase could also be translated to "Quick, the chicken farm." Nancy remembered seeing a chicken farm on the train ride in. They biked to it and there, they found the kidnappers' van covered in straw. There was also some oil stuck on the fender and a partial sticker with the letter groupings "IL," "CH" and "RY." In the loft of the barn they found Dr. Thompson tied up and called the police. Thompson told them that he had to co-operate or they would have killed him. He also heard the Germans mentioning the high and low tides and believed that they were being picked up in a submarine. Nancy and Indy rode back to the train station, not noticing two sinister men parked on the side of the road.
</p><p>That night as Indy was having supper at Nancy's, he discussed the kidnapping with her father. They figured that the van was probably stolen from wherever the Germans landed. The next day at school, Nancy told Indy that she figured that the Germans landed near the oil refineries at Bayonne and she said she would be going out to investigate. After school, Nancy left for Bayonne, but Indy was held after class. As soon as he could, he followed her, finding her in the dunes along the beach. They picked a spot to hide and wait. High tide came and went, but no German sub showed up. Instead, they spotted two men with guns who turned out to be Brady and another officer.

<p>That night at supper, Indy had a stroke of inspiration. He called Nancy and told her that it wasn't Germans who were after the submarine plans, but the oil companies after the battery plans. They met and headed out to the refinery. They sneaked in and overheard some men discussing Edison's battery. They also found the plans and learned that the letter groupings from the van were part of the phrase "oIL researCH laboratoRY." As they sneaked out, the theft of the plans was discovered. They were spotted by the two sinister men from the chicken farm who gave chase. Indy handed the plans to Nancy and told her to go to the police. Indy headed off their pursuers and was able to trick them into driving their car off a pier. The police showed up and arrested the two men. Brady allowed Indy and Nancy to take the plans back to Dr. Thompson themselves.
</p><p>The next day at Edison Labs, Indy and Nancy told Thompson about how they deduced who had stolen the plans. Nancy grew suspicious when Thompson talked about the oil refinery since Indy never mentioned the refinery. When they confronted him with this, he made a run for it, stealing the experimental car. Indy and Nancy gave chase in an old Model T. They managed to catch up with him after Indy took a short cut across an old rickety bridge, forcing him off the road just as the police arrive. When asked why he did it, Thompson said that he wanted credit for the work he did on Edison's various projects. When Edison received the plans back from Indy and Nancy, he graciously rebuilt the Bugati's generator. They arrived at the prom in style and Indy was able to show up Butch.<sup id="cite_ref-SBA_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SBA-42">[43]</a></sup>

It was among Villa's men that Indy met <a href="/wiki/Remy_Baudouin" title="Remy Baudouin">Remy Baudouin</a>, a Belgian national. The bandit's men were being forced south due to General Pershing's advance.
</p><p>A few days later, Villa was negotiating with an unsavory man by the name of <a href="/wiki/Claw" title="Claw" class="mw-redirect">Claw</a> for some rifles and explosives. Outside, Indy was helping with the unloading of weapons from Claw's wagon. He overheard Claw use an <a href="/index.php?title=Arabic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Arabic (page does not exist)">Arabic</a> word and asked him if he ever spent time in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, but Claw ignored him.
</p><p>That night, Indy talked to some of the rebels about why they joined Villa's bans. Villa himself summed it up best when he said that they were fighting for the right to peacefully raise a family and have a decent life. This persuaded Indy to join the revolution. The next day, Indy was part of a detail that was to pick up weapons at Claw's. While there he confirmed his suspicions that Claw and <a href="/wiki/Demetrios" title="Demetrios">Demetrios</a> was the same person. During the time Indy spent with Villa's men, he learned the Quechuan language from some of them.<sup id="cite_ref-KotCS_44-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-KotCS-44">[45]</a></sup>
</p><p>Later, in a cantina Remy was helping Indy compose a letter to his father when in walked a U.S. Army lieutenant. It was <a href="/wiki/George_Patton" title="George Patton" class="mw-redirect">George Patton</a>, who proceeded to get into a gunfight with <a href="/index.php?title=Julio_Cardenas&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Julio Cardenas (page does not exist)">Julio Cardenas</a>, who was killed. Patton reported back to <a href="/index.php?title=General&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="General (page does not exist)">General</a> <a href="/index.php?title=John_J._Pershing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John J. Pershing (page does not exist)">John J. Pershing</a> on the movements of Villa's men. This confirmed what Claw has just finished telling Pershing.
</p><p>Days later the rebels headed out with a train to attack Ciudad Guerrero. The attack went according to plan until Pershing staged a counterattack which forced the rebels to retreat. That night as the rebels hid from Pershing's men, Villa decided to attack William Randolph Hurst's Mexican hacienda. This, he hoped, would put Mexican President Carranza in a bad position with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. They took the hacienda easily as there was no one there. As Indy watched the looting, he began to feel that he really didn't belong with the Mexican revolution.
</p><p>That evening, Indy translated for the rebels the silent movies that were being shown in the basement. A newsreel was shown depicting the carnage being wrecked across Europe during the Great War. Remy was visibly upset by this. That evening, Remy, told Indy that he was leaving for Europe in the morning. He felt that if he was to die, he'd rather die fighting for his own homeland. Indy persuaded Remy to let him join him. Remy agreed and reminded Indy that they leave at dawn.

<p>In April, Indy and Remy arrived in <a href="/wiki/Queenstown" title="Queenstown">Queenstown</a> on their way to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> to enlist in the <a href="/index.php?title=Belgian_army&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Belgian army (page does not exist)">Belgian army</a>. They got a ride to <a href="/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, where they planned on getting jobs so they could pay for the ferry. They managed to get employment in a pub, waiting on tables and washing dishes. One afternoon, Indy was out to buy food for himself and Remy when he passed a restaurant window and saw two pretty girls inside. He went in and joined them. They introduced themselves as <a href="/wiki/Maggie_Lemass" title="Maggie Lemass">Maggie</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Nuala&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nuala (page does not exist)">Nuala</a>. They were also joined by Maggie's brother, <a href="/wiki/Sean_Lemass" title="Sean Lemass">Sean Lemass</a>. Through their conversation, the girls got the impression that Indy was a millionaire and he did nothing to dispel that idea.
</p><p>As they left the restaurant, Indy asked about some men who were marching down the street. Maggie explained that they were the <a href="/wiki/Irish_Volunteers" title="Irish Volunteers">Irish Volunteers</a>, a group that wished to overthrow British rule. She said that Sean was a member. Indy and Maggie made plans to meet at the theater the next day. When Indy got back to the room where he and Remy were staying, Remy got upset that he spent their money on tea and cakes for the girls.
</p><p>The next day, Indy met Maggie at the music hall. Inside, they were joined by Sean and Nuala. Indy enjoyed the show, especially a tenor who sang "When Irish Eyes are Smilin'". Afterwards, he excused himself and went off to work. While working, he hummed "Irish Eyes" to himself. He received some scorn from one of the patrons, a writer by the name of <a href="/wiki/Sean_O%27Casey" title="Sean O'Casey">Sean O'Casey</a>. O'Casey was disgusted with the stereotypical portrayal of the Irish that had made them the laughingstock of the world. He promised to show Indy some real theater by taking him to the Abbey the next day.
</p><p>There, they saw some of the rehearsals for a new play by <a href="/index.php?title=William_Butler_Yates&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="William Butler Yates (page does not exist)">William Butler Yates</a>. O'Casey explained to Indy that the play was symbolic of how <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> was taken over by the British. Later, Indy met with Maggie and Nuala for a walk along the beach. That evening at work, he ran into Sean and O'Casey who were arguing about the fate of a free Ireland. O'Casey wanted a socialist Ireland, not one that would be run by the Catholics.
</p><p>The next day, Indy and Remy met Maggie and Nuala. Remy took Nuala off so Indy could be alone with Maggie for a while. At work, Indy and O'Casey talked about theater. O'Casey loved the theater because being performed live, anything could happen. At its greatest moments, theater becomes life and life becomes theater. Sean arrived and O'Casey told him that he had quit the Irish Volunteers. Sean told Indy that he´d been invited to go swimming with Maggie.
</p><p>At the pool, Sean and Indy discussed Indy's reasons for fighting in the war. Sean said that Ireland must be free, that home rule while swearing allegiance to the King of England was not enough. Sean got upset and left, taking Maggie with him. The next day, Sean and O'Casey were having an argument out on a sidewalk. O'Casey didn't want to hear anymore about the Irish Volunteers from Sean. Sean started to walk off as Indy happened by. He warned Indy not to see Maggie anymore, but Indy paid him no heed.

<p>The next day, Indy, Maggie and Nuala spent some time together. They were spotted by Sean who didn't say anything. At the end of the afternoon, Indy told Maggie that he wasn´t a millionaire. She got upset and told him that she never wanted to see him again. Walking home from work, Indy met up with Sean. Sean pulled him into a warehouse to fight as a crowd began to gather. Indy tried to explain to Sean that he told Maggie the truth, but got a knuckle sandwich. Indy fought back and soon the whole crowd was swinging fists at each other. In the midst of the donnybrook, Indy and Sean called a truce. The days passed until <a href="/index.php?title=Easter_Monday&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Easter Monday (page does not exist)">Easter Monday</a> arrived. Indy and Remy finally had enough money for their ferry tickets and planned on leaving the next day.
</p><p>While they were walking home with Nuala, they saw a demonstration at the Post Office. Members of the Irish Volunteers had taken over the building and had issued a statement calling for a free <a href="/index.php?title=Irish_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Irish Republic (page does not exist)">Irish Republic</a>. They headed back to the pub where O'Casey told him the Volunteers didn't expect to gain anything. They were looking to become martyrs for their cause.
</p><p>The fighting continued through the week. Word arrived that the Volunteers had surrendered. Indy, Maggie and O'Casey rushed to the Post Office and saw Sean being led away by British soldiers. Later, British soldiers were executing members of the uprising at a nearby prison. Indy took Maggie there to see Sean. They were taken to his cell. Indy told him that most of the leaders of the uprising had already been shot. Sean wishes Indy good luck in Europe.
</p><p>The next day Indy and Remy were ready to board the ferry to London. O'Casey arrived to wish them luck. He told them to take a good look around. Ireland was changing and it wouldn't look the same if they ever came back.

He was impressed when she remained unfazed after a Zeppelin attack. Indy decided that he wanted to see her again and went to a suffragette meeting. There, he was impressed with a speech given by Sylvia Pankhurst and even defended her against the jeers of some men.
</p><p>After the meeting, Indy and Vicky went out for tea.

<p>The <a href="/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Somme&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Battle of the Somme (page does not exist)">Battle of the Somme</a>, in August 1916, was one of the deadliest battles ever fought. As a corporal, Indy was the highest ranking member of his unit. The French commander was not keen on loaning the company any of his existing lieutenants so he promoted a French sergeant, <a href="/wiki/Moreau" title="Moreau" class="mw-redirect">Moreau</a>, to lieutenant and placed him in command of Indy's unit. Moreau had some suspicions about one of the soldiers, a troublemaker named <a href="/wiki/Jacques" title="Jacques">Jacques</a>. Indy told him that he suspected Jacques was the one who killed their commander.
</p><p>Orders came down to recapture the Chateau La Maisonette, with the Belgian company leading the charge. The attack commenced on schedule, but the men were soon pinned down in foxholes by machine gun fire. Indy and Moreau managed to get some grenades to some men who were closest to the gunners, who used them to knock out the machine gun nests. The charge continued. The soldiers met the Germans in the first trench and hand-to-hand fighting began. The Belgians were able to force the Germans to retreat. The troops worked quickly to secure the trench. They received a communiqué that they were the only group to make it to the trench. Jacques provoked a fight with Indy which Moreau broke up.
</p><p>The troops were preparing for the second stage of the offensive when the Germans attacked with gas. Indy was forced to watch helplessly as a comrade who lost his gas mask in the charge died horribly. An eerie silence descended on the battlefield. Then the Germans slowly began their advance through the haze with a terrifying new weapon - the flame thrower. The Belgians retreated back to their own trenches, the entire offensive a failure.
</p><p>Later, orders came down granting the company a two day leave. They headed for a nearby town where the men were able to bathe, wash their uniforms and unwind. Indy and another soldier challenged a pair of British soldiers to a game of tennis, but lost. After the game, Indy and the two British lieutenants, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Graves" title="Robert Graves">Robert Graves</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siegfried_Sassoon" title="Siegfried Sassoon">Siegfried Sassoon</a>, had a couple of beers and discussed literature.
</p><p>When the company got back to the front, they were informed that a new attack was to be mounted on the chateau. The charge began and the Belgians took the first trench easily. Indy let Jacques know that Moreau suspected him of killing their officers. They charged the second trench but found it empty. Before the charge could continue, they were pinned down again by machine gun fire. Moreau decided to use an abandoned German tunnel to try to outflank the German gunners. Moreau, Indy and Jacques sneaked into the tunnel but were attacked by a German soldier. Indy was able to sneak up on him and kill him with a bayonet.
</p><p>Once through the tunnels, they found that they were behind the machine gun nests, which they took out with grenades. The rest of the troops charged and took the chateau. Later, Moreau was anxious as no reinforcements had arrived. He couldn't hold their position with only thirty men. Without warning, the Germans attacked, killing Moreau. In the confusion, Indy saw Remy wounded, but couldn't get to him. Jacques saved Indy from an attacking German and informed him that even though he didn't kill their captain, his saving Indy didn't make them friends. He was then suddenly shot dead by the Germans. As German soldiers overran the chateau, the Belgian soldiers retreated. Indy, however, was captured and taken prisoner.

<p>Indy was taken to a holding area for prisoners. There, he met <a href="/wiki/Emile" title="Emile">Emile</a>, another soldier from his unit who had the uniforms of two dead French soldiers. They assumed the officers' identities with Indy becoming Lt. <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Blanc" title="Pierre Blanc">Pierre Blanc</a>, as officers were treated better than enlisted men in the prisoner of war camps. Indy also moved through the other prisoners looking for Remy, but was unable to find him. While the prisoners were being transferred, the Allies started an artillery barrage. Taking advantage of the confusion, Indy and Emile tried to escape. Unfortunately they unwittingly seeked cover in a foxhole filled with German soldiers. They were recaptured and sent to a prisoner of war camp.
</p><p>Upon arrival, Indy and Emile began to walk around, checking the layout. A prisoner kicked a ball too close to a fence and was almost shot by the guards as he attempted to retrieve it. Indy validated the man's story that it was an accident to a skeptical guard. The prisoner introduced himself to Indy and Emile as <a href="/wiki/Captain" title="Captain">Captain</a> <a href="/wiki/Jean_Benet" title="Jean Benet">Jean Benet</a> and took them to a meeting of French officers who were planning an escape.

Benet suggested one concentrated effort to finish the tunnel in one night. They agreed and Indy and Emile helped out. Although they first miscalculated the distance to the outside, they finally completed the tunnel.
</p><p>As the men prepared to leave, the commandant came into the barracks on a surprise inspection. He almost discovered the tunnel, but Benet distracted him by provoking a fight. Benet was thrown into isolation, but the commandant did not discover the tunnel. The rest of the French officers moved through the tunnel. Indy and Emile brought up the rear but were spotted by the Germans as they left the tunnel. Emile was shot and Indy was recaptured.
</p><p>The Germans, convinced Indy was Lt. Blanc — an officer who had a history of escape attempts — sentenced him to an inescapable prison known as <a href="/wiki/Dusterstadt" title="Dusterstadt">Dusterstadt</a>, an old castle located on a rocky island in the middle of the <a href="/wiki/Danube_River" title="Danube River">Danube River</a>. It was a place for "incorrigible" prisoners. Upon arrival, Indy was introduced to the other prisoners who viewed him with suspicion, thinking he was a German spy. One prisoner, Captain <a href="/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle" title="Charles de Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, called Indy's bluff. He caved and told them the whole story of how he assumed Lt. Blanc's identity. They then accepted him into their ranks.
</p><p>The next day, Indy met <a href="/index.php?title=Corporal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Corporal (page does not exist)">Corporal</a> <a href="/wiki/Lambert" title="Lambert">Lambert</a>, a British soldier in charge of the infirmary. Indy and de Gaulle also had a discussion about the changing art of war. As he returned to his room that night, Indy was approached by the Russian prisoners <a href="/wiki/Yuri" title="Yuri">Yuri</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leonid" title="Leonid">Leonid</a>, who wanted to know if he could throw a lasso just like a real American cowboy. They wanted his help with an escape plan of theirs. They had made a rope from all of the package string they had collected and would use it in their escape. Indy had his doubts, but agreed to go along anyway.
</p><p>The following evening, Indy joined the Russians. Their plan called for Indy to lasso a spike on top of a building bordering the castle. They would then climb across and down the side of the wall to freedom. Indy managed to lasso the spike, but the Russians tried to cross the rope at the same time, causing it to break and plunging them into the river to their deaths. The next morning, the German commander reprimanded all of the prisoners. He brought out two body bags containing Yuri and Leonid to be displayed for all to see.

<p>Indy and de Gaulle hatched a plan to escape in the two Russians' coffins. They enlisted Lambert and his two orderlies into the plot. As per regular procedure, the orderlies would take the coffins to a graveyard on the shore to be buried. However, they would only put an inch of dirt on top of the coffins so Indy and de Gaulle could dig out easily. The German guards were superstitious so they wouldn't enter the cemetery and find out what was going on.
</p><p>All went according to plan until the orderlies reached the shore. They were informed of a change in procedure; the bodies were to be cremated not buried. The orderlies had no choice but to load the coffins on the truck and head back to the island. Indy and de Gaulle escaped from the truck before it reached the crematorium and set off across the countryside.
</p><p>By dawn, they made it to a small village where they stole two bicycles. They were spotted by a German patrol. They split up as two motorcycled Germans gave chase. De Gaulle was recaptured, but Indy lost his pursuer by dodging in front of a moving train.
</p><p>Following the escape, Jones joined what he thought was a German road-mending group. It turned out to be a work force of British POWs who were being taken to Berlin. Caught during a roll-call, he told the camp leaders that he was actually a double agent for the Germans and was sent ahead to Berlin where was able to contact the American Embassy.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[50]</a></sup>

<p>In September, broadened by his experiences on the front, Indy decided to stay in Europe, despite being given the opportunity to return home. He joined with the French as a courier for the High Command, French Second Army stationed near <a href="/wiki/Verdun" title="Verdun">Verdun</a>. Remy was assigned to an infantry unit. There was some dissension among the French generals. The commander of the Second Army, <a href="/index.php?title=General_Robert_Nivelle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="General Robert Nivelle (page does not exist)">General Robert Nivelle</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=General_Charles_Mangin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="General Charles Mangin (page does not exist)">General Charles Mangin</a> were in favor of ordering a frontal assault to reclaim Fort Douaumont, which the Germans have captured.

<p>Indy was dispatched to the front with orders for the attack to be delivered to <a href="/index.php?title=Colonel_Barc&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Colonel Barc (page does not exist)">Colonel Barc</a>. However, due to downed communications lines, the charge didn't begin until after the French artillery fire ceased. The troops charged, but without the benefit of covering fire they were slaughtered by the Germans and their machine guns. No ground was gained and the French lost six hundred soldiers.
</p><p>Indy returned to the command late at night with the news from the front. The report reached the generals who were dining in rather elegant surroundings. Nivelle was furious with the results. Meanwhile, Indy and the other couriers tried to figure out the reasons the war was being fought in the first place, but without a satisfactory answer. Indy was just disgusted with the whole affair.
</p><p>The next day Indy received word that Remy had been wounded and went to visit him at a nearby hospital. Remy confided in Indy that he was afraid of going back to the front, but Indy managed to convince him that if he refused to go he'd be shot by a firing squad. Later, Indy was enroute to the front with a message when he was attacked by a German bi-plane. Indy was blown off his motorbike by a bomb and the plane left him for dead. When Indy returned to headquarters, all the couriers were asked as to who speaks German. Indy replied that he did. He was promptly assigned on a mission to spy on the Germans.
</p><p>That evening, Indy crawled across no man's land and took up a position listening outside a German command bunker. There he overheard that the Germans had two Big Berthas, large howitzers, on the way. Before he could learn anymore, he was discovered and barely managed to escape. Indy gave his report to Barc who then took him to General Nivelle. Nivelle didn't believe Indy and ordered an attack readied. Petain argued with Nivelle, saying that they should try to confirm Indy's report. Nivelle ignored him.
</p><p>The next morning, Indy saw troops heading out towards the front with Remy among them. The two friends spoke, knowing that it might have been the last time they ever saw each other. Petain ordered an aerial reconnaissance which confirmed Indy's report. He tried to persuade Nivelle to call off the attack, but Nivelle said that he was under orders from Joffre. Petain took it upon himself to send written orders to the front calling off the attack. When Joffre found out, he was furious. He called Colonel Barc at the front to reinstate the attack. Barc said that he couldn't until he had a written countermanding order. Joffre quickly wrote one out and gave it to Indy to deliver. Petain asked what military objective could be gained by attacking, and Joffre explained to Petain that there was none; it was a political objective. Joffe said that the fort they were attacking was a symbol of national pride, and the public was shaken when the Germans captured it. The politicians, therefore, were dealing with the public by ordering Joffe to retake the fort. Petain found it all repugnant.
</p><p>On the way to the front, Indy, already bothered by the cranage he'd seen, reached a decision. He faked being in a motorcycle crash, destroying the attack orders. No one ever found out what he did and a few hundred soldiers lived another day.

<p>On a two week leave from the front the following month, Indy and Remy arrived in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> looking for "adventure of the softer and sweeter kind." Remy knew of the best brothel in town and was anxious to take Indy there. Indy, however, had to visit friends of his father's, Professor <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Levi" title="Jacques Levi">Jacques Levi</a> and his wife, and promised to meet Remy the next day.
</p><p>At the Levi's, Indy found that Mrs. Levi had a full week planned with plenty of things for Indy to do. Unfortunately, they all sounded frightfully dull and he made an excuse to get out of them. However, he couldn't get out of going to a reception with them that night for the Under-Secretary to the Minister of War. While there, a gorgeous woman entered the room, catching everyone's eye. He was told that she was the infamous <a href="/wiki/Mata_Hari" title="Mata Hari">Mata Hari</a>, an exotic dancer. There was a debate among some of the society members present as to whether her act was scandalous or not. Indy did manage to get to be introduced to her.
</p>

<p>Later, he followed her into a separate room where they spoke. He lied and said that he'd seen her dance. She asked him to dinner for the evening. He went to her hotel and found that there was a note waiting for him. She had been delayed and wondered if he'd wait in her room for her. As he went upstairs, he was watched by a suspicious looking man in the lobby.
</p><p>The next morning, the watcher was still there when she came back to find him asleep on the couch. She woke him up and they called room service for breakfast. Things got cozier and they made love. Afterwards, she told him that he seemed to be untouched by the horrors of war and that he should go to Africa where it was safer. That afternoon, they went for a walk, unaware that they were being followed. She told him to try and forget the war while he was on leave. He told her that he loved her. They saw some artists and Mata Hari told Indy that she'd always wanted to create something that would get people to talk. Perhaps that was why she danced. Indy wanted to spend the evening with her, but she had a dinner party to go to. They made plans to meet afterwards.
</p><p>Later, Indy met Remy at a café. He was there with two prostitutes. Indy apologized for being late, saying that he'd been having a hard time getting away. They figured out that he was in love. That evening, Indy went to Mata Hari's hotel room to wait for her. He found some pictures of her with other men and a beautiful engraved silver jewelry box that was a gift from a wealthy count. When she finally returned at dawn, Indy was upset and asked who she was with all night. She thought that he was being unreasonable as they had only known each other forty-eight hours. She calmed him down and they made love.
</p><p>Later, she told him that she had to move out of her country house as it had become too expensive to maintain. She needed to go out and supervise the workmen putting her things in storage and asked Indy to accompany her. As they sorted through some things, Indy found some of her old costumes and admitted he never saw her dance. She changed and performed a highly erotic dance for him that ended with them in bed. Afterwards, she had to run some errands and left Indy in charge of the movers. They made plans to meet that evening.
</p><p>The movers gave Indy a ride back to the hotel, but he just missed her. He found an address on her dressing table and went there to find her having dinner with another man. As they left, he followed them, unaware that he was also being followed. They went down to a rather shady area of Paris, where Mata Hari took her gentleman into an apartment building. He climbed up the side of the building to a window and peered in. When he saw them kiss, Indy lost his footing and fell into a pile of garbage below.
</p><p>Indy got up and spotted his shadower and attacked him. The other man's partner came out and they placed Indy under arrest. At police headquarters, Indy was in big trouble. They questioned him about his false name and age on his enlistment papers. They thought he might be a spy. They also asked him about his time with Mata Hari. He told them that he hadn't talked about the war. He tried to ask them what it was all about, but they wouldn't say. They told him to stay away from her and that his leave was canceled. He had twenty-four hours to report back to his unit.
</p><p>Indy went to Mata Hari’s hotel room, angry, and told her what happened. She was unconcerned whether they thought she was a spy or not since she had friends in high places who would help her. Indy told her that he felt like he had been used and they argued. Mata Hari told Indy that he was too young to really know what was going on in their relationship. He told her that he had to go back to the front in he morning. She softened, feeling genuinely sad and asked him to stay the night. Later, he got up, dressed and left to return to his unit before she woke up.

<p>Indy and Remy, sick of the war in Europe, requested and received a transfer to <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Upon their arrival in November, they received promotions to lieutenant. They were assigned to a unit stationed at Lake Victoria in <a href="/wiki/Nairobi" title="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>. However, they boarded the wrong train and ended up in Moshi. They got directions for the right train, but still managed to board another wrong train. The second train broke down and the engineer set off to bring back a repair crew. Unfortunately, this would take about a week.
</p><p>Consulting a map, Indy found another line running parallel to them ten miles east. He and Remy headed out. While admiring the beautiful sunset, Remy realized that they had been heading in the wrong direction. As they tried to make their way back to the train, they found an allied camp staffed entirely by old soldiers. Indy and Remy asked to see the commanding officer who turned out to be none other than Captain <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Selous" title="Frederick Selous">Frederick Selous</a>, whom Indy had met when he was in <a href="/wiki/British_East_Africa" title="British East Africa">British East Africa</a> at age nine. Indy explained to him the situation and Selous promised to take him to his commanders, General Jan Christian Smuts and Colonel <a href="/wiki/Richard_Meinertzhagen" title="Richard Meinertzhagen">Richard Meinertzhagen</a>, and explain the situation.
</p><p>Selous took Indy and Remy to a section of the front lines that was under heavy bombardment. Meinertzhagen figured that the Germans had a battleship cannon mounted on a railway flatcar. Before he realized what had happened, Indy found himself "volunteered" by Selous to be part of a group called the <a href="/index.php?title=25th_Royal_Fusiliers&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="25th Royal Fusiliers (page does not exist)">25th Royal Fusiliers</a> that was to find the train and destroy it. The other members of the group included <a href="/index.php?title=Bernie_Salt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bernie Salt (page does not exist)">Bernie Salt</a>, naval expert, <a href="/index.php?title=Big_Mac&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Big Mac (page does not exist)">Big Mac</a>, demolitions expert, <a href="/index.php?title=Mr._Golo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mr. Golo (page does not exist)">Mr. Golo</a>, an expert native tracker, <a href="/wiki/Zoltan" title="Zoltan">Zoltan</a>, a mechanic and <a href="/wiki/Donald_Parks" title="Donald Parks">Donald Parks</a>, strategist. Selous was in command. Remy was furious when Indy told him and was convinced that they would both be shot as deserters.
</p><p>The group sat out on horseback. That evening, they made camp. Selous admitted to Indy that they didn't have much of a plan, and that they would just improvise. The Germans began shelling and Selous timed the shells' flights, estimating a location for the rail line. That morning, Indy accidentally got the explosives wet. Big Mac was furious, but said everything should be all right even though he was not sure about the detonator caps.
</p><p>They sat out and soon found a German camp sat up along some rail lines. Waiting until dark, they walked right into the camp, posing as drunken soldiers. They split up and Indy was sent off to steal toilet paper. He also stole a car with Bernie. They met the others outside of camp. They had procured a railway handcart. Indy and Bernie were given the handcart and the rest would take the car to the other end of the rail line. Starting at opposite ends, they would push towards the center and find the gun. Indy and Bernie caught up to the gun train early the next morning. It fired once and then started down the line. They raced after it.
</p><p>Meanwhile, up the track, the others spotted the train coming and hid. Indy and Bernie tried to catch up to the train, but lost site of it when it disappeared behind a hill. Eventually they came into sight of the others, but the train did not pass them. It had seemingly disappeared! While the others tried to decide what to do next, Indy examined the toilet paper they stole, which was actually old documents being "recycled" due to the scarcity of paper. One of the documents was an order for forty miles of telegraph cable. They found the cable buried along side of the track and followed it. It leads to a dead end at the side of a cliff face.

<p>Further examination of the cliff face revealed that it was artificial, hiding the entrance to a cavern. They sneaked in and found the train. Big Mac immediately began supervision of the laying of the explosives. They had to hurry when some Germans began to approach the train to prepare for another mission. They quickly set the timers and got to cover. Unfortunately, nothing happened due to faulty wiring in the timers. They had to go back and reset them. Selous managed to jump the shovelman, knocking him unconscious. Indy was to replace him in the engine's cab and try to delay the train's departure. Despite his best efforts, the train began to pull out of the cavern with the rest of the group hanging onto the side.
</p><p>Big Mac and Zoltan went back and reset the timers. Indy threw the two engineers out of the cab so the others could get in. Soldiers further back on the train spotted the engineers' "departures" and tried to storm the engine. A fire fight ensued. They managed to separate the car with the soldiers from the front half of the train and made off with the gun. Indy suggested breaking through the German lines and taking the gun right back to the Allied lines. 
</p><p>Unfortunately, the German had telegraphed ahead. They managed to blow up a section of track and sent soldiers down to meet the train. The group stopped the train and managed to escape under the cover of steam. From a couple of hundred yards away, they witnessed the German troops arriving and disarming the explosives. Selous took out a sharpshooter's rifle, intending to shoot and detonate the dynamite. Indy was skeptical of him making the shot, however, Selous managed to do it. The train exploded and they headed back to Allied lines.

<p>Remy was glad to see Indy for he was anxious about rejoining their unit. Meanwhile, <a href="/index.php?title=General_Smuts&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="General Smuts (page does not exist)">General Smuts</a> was telling the others about the chance to capture General <a href="/wiki/Paul_von_Lettow-Vorbeck" title="Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck">Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</a>, a German officer who had been a thorn in the Allies' side. Indy arrived and asked the General for a letter to his commanding officer explaining the circumstances of their tardiness. Selous convinced Indy to take an alternate route to <a href="/index.php?title=Lake_Victoria&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lake Victoria (page does not exist)">Lake Victoria</a> and that they would accompany him on the trip. They neglected to tell Indy that the new route would bring them close to where the reports saw von Lettow was. Since they would be passing through German territory, they disguised themselves as Boer settlers. Remy was not happy with the plan, especially since he was the one who had to wear the dress.

<p>On the first day out, they spotted and overtook a German courier. It was a woman by the name of <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Trappe" title="Margaret Trappe">Margaret Trappe</a>. Selous knew her and her mother, who was one of the finest aviators in Africa. They took her prisoner and made camp that night. Indy took Margaret something to eat and tried to engage her in conversation. She told Indy that they'd never catch "him," but he didn't know what she was talking about. He asked Selous about it, but he feigned ignorance. 
</p><p>The next day they encountered a German patrol. They hid Bernie and Margaret in a secret compartment, however, their disguises didn't fool the Germans and they were taken prisoner. The wagon was searched, but Bernie and Margaret were not found. At the German camp, they were brought before von Lettow who recognized Selous. They exchanged pleasantries before von Lettow ordered them to be shot in the morning. Until then they were placed in a prison cell.
</p><p>Later that night, Bernie emerged from the hidden compartment and made his way to where the group was being held. Knocking out the guard, he freed them. They sabotaged the Germans' motor pool and reconnaissance plane so they couldn't be followed. They took one car for their own escape. Selous decided that they should try to kidnap von Lettow. They sneaked into his tent and took him easily. Meanwhile, Margaret had kicked her way out of the compartment and sounded an alarm. The group split up, leaving Indy and Remy with von Lettow. They took cover in a large basket which turned out to be a balloon gondola. As the German soldiers got closer, Indy launched the balloon. It floated to where the others were waiting with the car, but Indy couldn't get it to land. With the German soldiers closing in, the others had no choice but to make their escape. Indy got the balloon high enough to make their own escape.

<p>The next day, von Lettow was becoming increasingly disgusted with Indy and Remy's ineptitude. He checked his compass and told them that they were heading for German territory and that he'd be glad to accept their surrender. They took the compass to check for themselves and found that they were actually heading towards the north which was Allied territory. Just then, some pursuing German troops came into range and began to open fire, puncturing the balloon. Despite Indy's frantic attempts at patching and Remy throwing over the ballast, they lost altitude and the balloon started skimming the ground. Indy had to fight off the few soldiers daring enough to try to board the balloon. It seemed hopeless when the balloon suddenly got swept into an updraft and floated out over a cliff, stranding their pursuers.
</p><p>As Indy finished patching the balloon, Margaret showed up in the repaired reconnaissance plane. Remy pulled out a heavy machine gun and managed to hit the plane, disabling it. As she came around for one last pass, Indy tried his hand at the machine gun. Unfortunately, it walked up on him and he winded up shooting the balloon to ribbons. The craft made a soft crash landing. They now had proceed on foot.
</p><p>As they walked, von Lettow told how he had managed to run circles around the British for the last two years. He explained that a soldier had two imperatives: first was to follow orders and the second to stay alive. The next day, they encountered some tribesmen who looked threatening. They tried to run for it, but were followed. Indy gave von Lettow a gun as a gesture of trust. The tribesmen had the three surrounded, when Margaret appeared and buzzed them in the repaired reconnaissance plane. The tribesmen fled in terror. She landed and von Lettow tried to escape to the plane. Indy pulled a gun on him and Margaret pulled her gun on Indy. Remy was pointing his rifle at Margaret. They were trapped in a standoff and German soldiers could be seen coming in the distance.
</p><p>Following von Lettow's logic, Indy concluded that since he had no specific orders concerning von Lettow, his first responsibility was to stay alive, and let von Lettow go. In return, he gave Indy and Remy his compass and promised to call off the soldiers. Two days later, Indy and Remy were still making their way back to Allied territory when they found Selous and the rest of the group. Selous offered them a ride, and promised to get them to Lake Victoria.

<p>Indy and Remy finally made it to their Belgian unit near Lake Tanganyika. They were assigned to a company of native Askaris under the command of Major <a href="/wiki/Boucher" title="Boucher">Boucher</a>. During an attack, Indy saw an opening in the German defenses and rallied the men to charge, even though Major Boucher had ordered a retreat. During the charge, Indy went down, seemingly shot. After a moment he got back up and continued the charge. He single-handedly captured a machine gun nest and turned it on the Germans. A rout ensued. It turned out that the bullet that hit Indy was actually reflected off of the locket he received from Princess Sophie when he was a child. This earned the respect of the natives who now viewed Indy as one with powerful ju-ju, or magic. Boucher, however, was furious with Indy, but since his actions helped defeat the Germans in the area, he was given a promotion to captain.
</p><p>Major Boucher received orders that he as to lead his company on an expedition across the <a href="/wiki/Congo" title="Congo">Congo</a> to get much-needed weapons and supplies from Cape Lopez, a trip of over two thousand miles. Indy was not thrilled at the prospect of the trip or of spending so much time with Boucher. However, their commanding officer, <a href="/index.php?title=Colonel_Mathieu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Colonel Mathieu (page does not exist)">Colonel Mathieu</a>, felt that they'd temper each one's personality.
</p><p>The company sat out, but the way was hard. They traveled across desert and jungle, occasionally losing men to accident or disease. Along the way, they came across an apparently deserted village. Upon investigation, they discovered that everyone had died from small pox with the exception of one small child. Boucher ordered the child left behind in order to avoid infecting the company. Indy disagreed but was overruled. Indy's sergeant, <a href="/wiki/Barthelemy" title="Barthelemy" class="mw-redirect">Barthelemy</a>, complained but Indy had his orders.
</p><p>The company pressed on. Some men started to fall sick from yellow fever. Boucher ordered these men left behind with limited rations and ordered to make it back to the base. Again Indy clashed with Boucher, but backed down. When the company stopped and sat up camp for the night, Indy discovered that Barthelemy has snucked the Ubangi child along. As much as he hated to, Indy told Boucher. Again, Boucher ordered the child to be left behind.
</p><p>The next morning when the company formed up, Barthelemy had the child with him. He refused to leave him behind even when ordered by Boucher. The rest of the company stood with him. Faced with such insubordination, Boucher began to rant and act irrational. Indy was forced to take command. They continued on with the child. By Christmas Eve, most of the men still alive had fallen sick. Indy began to wonder if they'd ever reach Cape Lopez.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/1916" title="1916">1916</a> turned to <a href="/wiki/1917" title="1917">1917</a>. Boucher fell ill, and Indy ordered a litter built over Boucher's objections. They finally reached Franceville, the beginning of the last leg of their journey. Here, they hired <a href="/index.php?title=Sloat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sloat (page does not exist)">Sloat</a> to take them to Cape Lopez, five hundred miles down river. Along the way, their boat was attacked by a group of deserters. Barthelemy was wounded but the boat was saved from running aground when the Ubangi child took the rudder and steered it to safety. Further down the river they passed a hospital, but Sloat said that it was run by a German.
</p><p>Boucher ordered them to continue. More men died. Finally Cape Lopez came into view, but Boucher died before they could dock. His last order to Indy was to wire the boat with explosives for the return trip and blow it up if the Germans tried to capture it. The fort doctors examined the Ubangi boy and gave him a clean bill of health. Barthelemy wasn't so lucky, he died from his wounds. Indy gave the boy to the missionary nuns to raise and told them his name was Barthelemy.

<p>At <a href="/wiki/Port-Gentil" title="Port-Gentil">Port-Gentil</a>, Indy was told by the <a href="/wiki/Pernod" title="Pernod">French commander</a> that he couldn't spare any men to help Indy with the return journey. Indy vowed to make the return trip with the small band that was left. Remy thought Indy was crazy for trying and refused to participate. Jones pulled rank on him, and Baudouin capitulated but left his superior a punch in the face. They loaded the weapons and supplies onto <a href="/wiki/Collette" title="Collette">Sloat's boat</a>. Sloat was not happy with Indy rigging the ship with explosives.
</p><p>They started backup the river, but the diseases that plagued them on the trip down continued to decimate the company. Soon, as all the crew was on the verge of death, the boat was boarded by a <a href="/wiki/Joseph" title="Joseph" class="mw-redirect">black man speaking German.</a> A fevered Indy panicked and tried to set off the explosives, but he was knocked unconscious. He reawakened briefly to find himself being carried off the boat, but lost consciousness again.
</p><p>Indy reawakened to a German doctor who gave him some medicine and told him he was not a prisoner. That night, Indy sneaked out to try to escape. The doctor came out to the boat and tried to convince Indy to come back to the hospital ward, but he refused. Later a woman came out to see Indy. She introduced herself as <a href="/wiki/Helene_Schweitzer" title="Helene Schweitzer">Mrs. Schweitzer</a> and the doctor was her husband, <a href="/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer" title="Albert Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a>. She had brought Indy some tea and told him that he was unconscious for five days.
</p><p>The next morning, Indy awoke on the boat, unmolested. Schweitzer arrived to inform him that only five of his company had survived. Touring the hospital at <a href="/wiki/Lambar%C3%A9n%C3%A9" title="Lambaréné">Lambaréné</a>, Jones saw his surviving men, including <a href="/wiki/Zimu" title="Zimu">Zimu</a>, and Remy, who had lost two toes to jiggers. Indy apologized to his friend saying that they never should have attempted the trip back. That evening, Indy dined with the Schweitzers. They discussed the reasons for the doctor's missionary work in Africa, and Albert and Indiana played a little ragtime duet on the doctor's piano.

<p>The next day, messengers arrived from a Pahouin tribe upriver asking for "Oganga" - the term for Dr. Schweitzer as "The Giver and Taker of Life". Their chief's son was ill. Indy volunteered Sloat's boat for the house call, and took Schweitzer and Joseph up river to their <a href="/wiki/Pahouin_village" title="Pahouin village">village</a>. Schweitzer was able to operate on the <a href="/wiki/Pahouin_Chief%27s_Son" title="Pahouin Chief's Son">chief's son</a> and save his life -- charging the boy to remember the lesson of his own pain, and work to ease the pain of others. Later, around a campfire, the <a href="/wiki/Pahouin_Chief" title="Pahouin Chief">Pahouin Chief</a> asked about the war in Europe. Schweitzer had to put the idea of the devastating loss of life into terms that the chief would understand and told him that more than ten men had been killed. This caused concern with the chief. On the return trip to Lambaréné, Schweitzer explained the philosophy he had developed - "Reverence for Life" regarding keeping focus on promoting life and not ending life. Jones began to have a change of heart regarding his role in the war - rather than working to win it, he should be working to end it.
</p><p>When Indy and Schweitzer arrived back at the hospital, they found French soldiers under <a href="/wiki/Emile_Rostand" title="Emile Rostand">Captain Rostand</a> waiting to seize the doctor. They were under orders to apprehend all Germans in French territory for expulsion. Indy tried to reason with Rostand, but to no avail. Indy was also told that his mission to bring guns to <a href="/wiki/Tabora" title="Tabora">Tabora</a> was unnecessary as Tabora had already fallen. The entire trip, including the loss of life, was for nothing. As the boat with the Schweitzers slowly headed down the river towards Cape Lopez, the sick natives left the hospital, useless without its doctor, and returned to the jungle to die.
</p><p>Back at <a href="/wiki/Cape_Lopez" title="Cape Lopez">Cape Lopez</a>, Indy argued with the fort's commander, but again accomplished nothing. Indy was ordered to take the weapons back to Europe on the next available steamer. Indy and Remy went to see the Schweitzers off. Albert left Indy with some words of wisdom - "A little subversion is good for the soul”.

<p>Indy and Remy left the war in <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a> and returned to <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> to join the Belgium intelligence division. After all of the horrors he'd seen in the trenches, Indy wanted to do whatever he could to put a stop to the war. Indy and Remy attended courses on spy tactics and Indy came to realize that the Belgium intelligence unit was badly organized and ineffectual in comparison to the French and British intelligence services.
</p><p>Indy decided that if he and Remy were going to make a difference in the war at all, they were going to need to be transferred to the French intelligence service. Indy forged papers ordering him and Remy to be transferred to the French intelligence service and Remy delivered them.
</p><p>The two were called into the French secret service headquarters and were told that their service records in the Belgium army were outstanding as were the forged papers requesting their transfer. Just as the two began thinking that they were going to end up in jail, they were told that the intelligence service could use men like them. The two were asked if they could cook and Remy said that he could. They were also asked if they had any experience with airplanes. Indy said he did even though he hated flying for fear of ending up with housekeeping duty. Remy was assigned to be an intelligence contact at a cafe in Brussels and the main contact with the Belgian Underground. And Indy was ordered back to the Western Front to do photographic reconnaissance for the <a href="/wiki/124th_Squadron" title="124th Squadron">124th Squadron</a>, a group of volunteer American pilots fighting for the French army, until a new assignment came in.
</p><p>Remy saw Indy off as he prepared to leave for his own assignment in Belgium. Indy arrived at the squadron base and met <a href="/index.php?title=Raoul_Lufbery&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Raoul Lufbery (page does not exist)">Raoul Lufbery</a> who told Indy that he'd be flying with Lt. <a href="/index.php?title=Harold_Green&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Harold Green (page does not exist)">Harold Green</a> and taking photos, not analyzing them. Indy met the members of the 124th Squadron, one of whom was <a href="/wiki/Hobey_Baker" title="Hobey Baker">Hobey Baker</a>, who Indy used to run errands for. Indy learned that the longest any reconnaissance photographer had lasted with the squadron had been eight days.

<p>The next day, Indy was about to take a photo of the squad when the French flying ace <a href="/wiki/Charles_Nungesser" title="Charles Nungesser">Charles Nungesser</a> landed. Indy was told he's the best in the squad, but after looking at the number of bandages he had on, Indy thought he looked more like a walking accident. Later, the squad was informed that <a href="/wiki/General_Nivelle" title="General Nivelle" class="mw-redirect">General Nivelle</a> needed photos taken of a reported arms build up at the railroad yard in Ham which was about 40 kilometers behind the line.
</p><p>Indy got his first taste of the dangers involved in flying low over enemy territory while trying to take photos. He managed to get the photos taken, but a squadron of German fighters attacked them. The plane Indy was in was hit and Green thought the wheels might have been shot off. He ordered Indy to climb out on the wing to see if the wheels were still there and Indy barely managed to hang on as Green was forced to flip the plane around to avoid German fire. In the process, however, Indy got a close up look at the wheels which were still there. Their plane was shot once again and they were forced to make an emergency landing in German territory.
</p><p>Green was shot in the arm as they ran from the crashed plan and both men were captured by the Germans. <a href="/index.php?title=Baron_Manfred_von_Richthofen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Baron Manfred von Richthofen (page does not exist)">Baron Manfred von Richthofen</a>, the ace German fighter pilot who would later become known as the "Red Baron", landed and claimed the crashed plane as his trophy and Indy and Green as his prisoners since he shot them down. Green was taken to a hospital and Indy was invited to von Richthofen's castle to be his "guest" for lunch.
</p><p>Back at the 124th Squadron base, the other men reported in and Hobey immediately headed back to search for Indy and Green. At the Baron's castle, Indy was told by von Richthofen's brother how the Baron lived to hunt and how they were like knights adorned with colorful scarves and the fighter planes were their steeds. Indy asked why they don't just paint their planes red. Von Richthofen asked Indy if he knew Nungesser who shot down his brother. He told Indy that he felt obliged to avenge his brother and Indy watched as he wrote a challenge for Nungesser to aerial combat.
</p><p>Later, Indy was sent to a German prison and von Richthofen ordered his plane to be painted red. On the way to the prison, Indy managed to escape and commandeer a German car. Hobey spotted him from his plane and managed to pick him up. The two arrived back at the base just as a German plan flied by dropping von Richthofen's challenge to Nungesser. Nungesser was in Paris, so the rest of the squad went to bring the challenge to him. Nungesser accepted the challenge and asked Indy to accompany him to take photos of his victory. Indy reluctantly agreed and flied with Hobey as they and Nungesser headed off to the designated sight the next day.
</p><p>Nungesser managed to shoot von Richthofen, but Indy and Hobey were not certain if the plan went down. A full German squadron suddenly attacked them and Nungesser was shot down. Indy and Hobey returned to the base and developed the film which confirmed that Nungesser shot down von Richthofen. Nungesser was brought back to the base having been rescued from No Man's Land where his plane went down. He told them that he thought von Richthofen managed to land.
Back in Germany, Anthony Fokker, the leading German designer of fighter planes, showed von Richthofen the new fighter he had designed, the Fokker DR-1 Triplane, which was much more powerful than the Baron's Albatross which Nungesser shot down. Back at the base, Nungesser said goodbye to Indy as he headed back to Paris, but promised to be back in time to take Indy back to Paris himself when Indy's assignment was up. Von Richthofen saw the picture Indy took of his plane going down in the newspaper and told his brother that next time he would shoot the cameraman down first.

<p>Indy managed to survive on many reconnaissance missions over the next week, but on the last day of his assignment the squad was called in by Lufbery and told about a possible new German airfield that intelligence had learned of. They believed it to be the home-base of the recent night bombings that had been made by the Germans. Indy was ordered to fly with Hobey and get pictures of the airfield to determine exactly where it was.
</p><p>The 124th Squadron flied over the enemy lines and Indy got the pictures taken, but von Richthofen and a squadron of German fighters attacked. Richthofen shot up Indy and Hobey's plane and they began to plummet towards the ground. At the last minute they managed to pull out of their fall and landed the plane back at the base. Indy prepared to leave and was told by Hobey and Raoul that Wilson had declared war on Germany and America was now in the war. Raoul told Indy that the 124th squadron would be turned over to the Americans. Indy told them that he just hoped he never had to fly again. Just then, Nungesser showed up to take Indy back to Paris.
</p><p>On the way, Nungesser told Indy that he'd been given a special assignment. Nungesser dropped Indy off at the French Intelligence Headquarters. Indy reported in and was told of his next assignment: to contact Fokker and persuade him to defect to the French. He was to tell Fokker that if he accepted, another agent would arrive and make arrangements to get him out of Germany. He was told to report to room 13B for debriefing. Indy went to 13B and was given his travel papers to Hannover and his new identity to travel under. Indy was then told to go to room 13C. He did so and was given a full compliment of spy-related items hidden in his clothing such as maps hidden in his suit, materials to make a camera hidden in his right shoe and a retractable knife hidden in his left shoe. He as also given a suitcase and a vial of invisible ink and told to go on to room 13A. In 13A, Indy was told that he should try to reach Fokker at a hotel in Hannover where he would be staying on his way to a German military base. Indy was given the letter for Fokker detailing the French government's offer and was told he would leave for Hannover that night.
</p><p>Indy found that the pilot who was flying him to Hannover was Charles Nungesser. Indy was upset to find out that he wouldn't actually be landing in Hannover, but instead had to parachute down. Indy landed in the middle of town and managed to hide the parachute before he could be discovered. He checked in to the hotel that Fokker was staying at, but found out that he had arrived just as Fokker was leaving. Indy was unable to deliver the letter, so he followed Fokker onto a train heading to Ahlhorn.

<p>Fokker was traveling with German military officers <a href="/index.php?title=Werner&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Werner (page does not exist)">Admiral Werner</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Von_Kramer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Von Kramer (page does not exist)">General von Kramer</a> and thus the only way Indy was able to contact Fokker was by dressing as a steward and slipping a note into Fokker's pocket. They arrived at Ahlhorn and Indy posed as Fokker's valet in order to accompany Fokker and the German's heading to the military base. Meanwhile, Nungesser was waiting in Hannover for Indy and decided that if Indy didn't show by nightfall he would have to leave.
</p><p>Indy brought Fokker's bags to his room and at last got to speak with him. He gave Fokker the letter, but Werner and Von Kramer arrived for Fokker with aircraft designer <a href="/wiki/Villehad_Forssman" title="Villehad Forssman">Villehad Forssman</a> and a compliment of German military officers before Indy could get a reply. Indy hid as Fokker was told by Forssman that he had designed a new aircraft fighter which would be arriving later in the day. Fokker headed out with them and Indy wrote a letter to French Intelligence which appeared to be a request for a hotel reservation, but in invisible ink contained a warning of the new secret weapon.
</p><p>Indy was able to meet with Fokker again later and Fokker told Indy that he was not interested because the money the French were offering was too little and the facilities in Germany were far better. Indy tried to ask him if he cared if his work was put to the use of good or evil. Fokker told Indy that science thrived in the times of war due to the money government's put towards weapons development and in the end humanity as a whole benefited from the advances in technology. He told Indy to leave, but on the way out Indy stole Fokker's cigar box.
</p><p>Indy sneaked into the barracks and stole a German uniform. He turned the cigar box into a makeshift camera with the supplies he was given by French Intelligence. Baron von Richthofen arrived at the Ahlhorn base to see Forssman's invention. Indy bluffed his way into one of the cars headed towards the airfield to see the invention. Once there Indy witnessed the arrival of Forssman's monstrosity, a gigantic triplane with ten engines that could fly from Germany to New York in order to drop bombs. Fokker claimed that if he was allowed to work on it he could make it fly twice as far. Indy took pictures of it from the top of a hanger, but von Richthofen spotted him. German soldiers rushed Indy, but a shot from a soldier's gun ignited fuel stored in the hanger. Indy escaped in the confusion and the fire ignited the hydrogen stored in the hanger for the Zeppelins. The resulting explosion took out the entire airfield including the Forssman's new aircraft. Indy stole a motorcycle and made his way back to Hannover where he arrived just in time to catch Nungesser before he left and the two headed back to Paris.

<p>In May, Indy was run off the road while on his bike by a car driven by two young men as he rode to French intelligence service headquarters to learn of his next assignment. When he arrived, he learned he was there to meet the two young men who ran him off the road. They were a bit disappointed in him as Indy did not fit their idea of a spy. Indy learned that they were the Princes <a href="/index.php?title=Xavier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Xavier (page does not exist)">Xavier</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Sixtus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sixtus (page does not exist)">Sixtus</a> of Borbon-Parma and he had been assigned to escort them to meet with their brother-in-law, <a href="/index.php?title=Emperor_Karl_I&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Emperor Karl I (page does not exist)">Emperor Karl I</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>.

Such a move would seriously weaken Germany and help bring the war to a rapid close.
</p><p>At the rail-station, the three were given forged papers and told that once they were in Austria to await contact from an operative named <a href="/index.php?title=Schultz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Schultz (page does not exist)">Schultz</a>. On the train, Indy was upset with the brothers' carefree attitude. He took from Sixtus a letter written by their sister <a href="/index.php?title=Empress_Zita&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Empress Zita (page does not exist)">Empress Zita</a> and burned it. If they had been discovered with the letter they would have definitely been shot as spies.

<p>At the Austrian boarder, they separated to pass through the checkpoint. Indy and Xavier made it through, but Sixtus was taken by the secret service. Xavier started to panic, but Indy calmed him and got him on the train. Sixtus rejoined them as the train began to pull away from the checkpoint. Evidently, the secret service thought he was someone else. Indy thought they might have let him go in order to shadow the trio. Just then a large woman entered the compartment and sat down, curtailing any further conversation.
</p><p>Later, a conductor entered to punch tickets, but took Xavier's and Sixtus's. Indy followed the conductor to another compartment and questioned him. It seemed that there was some mix up with their compartment assignments. Indy went to return to the compartment, but found it empty except for one man. The man made what Indy interpreted as a threatening move and Indy attacked him. All he was reaching for was his cigars. Indy apologized, realized he was in the wrong compartment and headed off to the right one.
</p><p>Outside of Vienna, the three got off the train and awaited contact from Schultz. The large woman approached them and identifies herself. She gave them new identity papers, that of Austrian soldiers on leave, and a car. She instructed them to drive to an address in Vienna and to introduce themselves as "friends of Frederick." They arrived at the address to find police carrying out bodies. An officer told them that they had just smashed a spy ring. As they began to drive away, a mysterious man got into the car and instructed them to drive. All this was watched by a menacing-looking <a href="/index.php?title=Prussian&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Prussian (page does not exist)">Prussian</a>. The man introduced himself as <a href="/index.php?title=Mr._Max&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mr. Max (page does not exist)">Mr. Max</a> and a friend of Frederick. He took them to a café where he handed them over to two men. Indy was distrustful of the whole set up. Max left them, but was followed. The three were taken by car to a hunting lodge out in the country.
</p><p>There, in the basement, they finally met Emperor Karl. <a href="/index.php?title=Count_Czernin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Count Czernin (page does not exist)">Count Czernin</a>, the foreign minister was summoned. Xavier and Sixtus told them that France and Britain wanted peace. Czernin had some misgivings regarding the demands. He felt that the Kaiser would label their actions as treasonous. They had to balance the consequences of breaking their alliance with Germany with the war continuing. Karl also didn't want to be known as the last Emperor of Austria. The Count said he would draft an acceptance letter. The letter the Count wrote was vague. Despite his misgivings about it, Karl signed it.
</p><p>The next day as the trio prepared to leave, Karl slipped Indy another letter. Karl agreed to the demands and was suing for peace. Back in Vienna, they arrived at Mr. Max's but found him dead. They were ambushed by the Prussian's men and escaped into the sewer after a chase across the rooftops and alleyways. They managed to get to the train, but were going to have a problem getting across the boarder with no new identity papers and still dressed as Austrian soldiers.
</p><p>At the last stop before the Austrian-Swiss boarder, the train was searched by the Prussian's men. The three hid in a women's bathroom to avoid detection. Indy was able to trick two of the secret service men into a trap as the train continued. He dressed Sixtus and Xavier up in their clothes and instructed them to get through the checkpoint and return the letter to France. The brothers got through the checkpoint just as the secret service men revived and sounded an alarm. Indy was trying to sneak across the boarder on top of the train and managed to make it into Swiss territory where he immediately claimed to be an Austrian deserter seeking assylum. He smiled at the Prussian man as he was taken away to safety.

<p>In June, Indy was assigned to the French embassy in <a href="/wiki/Petrograd" title="Petrograd" class="mw-redirect">Petrograd</a>. He was to help other members of French Intelligence determine when the <a href="/index.php?title=Bolsheviks&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bolsheviks (page does not exist)">Bolsheviks</a> were going to make their move to a revolution. While there, he befriended several local students who were very passionate about their political beliefs.
</p><p>One month later, Indy was buried deep in the Embassy's basement working at decoding and translation, though he'd much rather have been out in the field. He disagreed with his colleague Brossard's analysis that the Bolsheviks were planning to move soon. Indy felt that the Bolsheviks were still too small to be a serious threat.
One day as he was decoding communique, Indy came across a message which alarmed him. He went and met two friends of his, <a href="/index.php?title=Sergei&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sergei (page does not exist)">Sergei</a>, a deserter from the Russian army and <a href="/index.php?title=Irena&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Irena (page does not exist)">Irena</a>. Both of them were at a demonstration. Indy warned him not to go, but couldn't say why. Sergei agreed.
</p><p>Later, the French Ambassador called a meeting of the Intelligence Staff. He felt that the provincial government was hanging on by its fingertips and that there could be an insurrection within the next two weeks. Given Lenin's threats to pull Russia out of the war if he came to power, both the ambassador and the provincial government would like any information that they could get.
</p><p>Indy spent the rest of the day collecting leaflets from around the city. That evening, Indy met with Sergei and some other of his friends. One of them, <a href="/index.php?title=Boris&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Boris (page does not exist)">Boris</a>, told of a roundup of deserters at the Embassy and Indy didn't ask what went on at the Bolshevik meetings. Later, Indy headed back to the embassy where he spent the rest of the evening analyzing the leaflets he collected. The next day he met with his friends again. One of Irena's friends, <a href="/index.php?title=Rosa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Rosa (page does not exist)">Rosa</a>, had a crush on Indy. She invited him to a <a href="/index.php?title=Mozart&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mozart (page does not exist)">Mozart</a> recital that evening. However, when they got to the theater, they found that it had been canceled. Instead, they went for a walk throughout the city, ultimately winding up back at Indy's apartment, where Sergei and the others had set up a surprise birthday party for him. As they cut the cake, there was some good natured ribbing about the nature of capitalism and communism.
</p><p>Afterwards, they took Indy to hear Lenin speak. At the rally, <a href="/index.php?title=Lenin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lenin (page does not exist)">Lenin</a> denounced the war to an enthusiastic crowd. As people left the hall after Lenin finishes, Indy overheard two men arguing about the timing of the revolution. Making excuses, Indy left the group and sneaked into Bolshevik headquarters. He snooped through the printshop and found a flyer calling for the workers to rise up, but there were no dates on it. He was almost caught by two guards, but managed to escape back to the embassy. There, he conferred with Brossard who thought that the Bolsheviks would strike when the steelworkers were ready to join them. Indy disagreed. 
</p>

<p>Indy went home around dawn to find Rosa waiting for him. She confessed her love for him, but while he was flattered, he told her that he didn't feel the same way about her. She mentioned that Sergei would be talking to some steelworkers later the same day. Indy confronted Sergei. He knew that there were more meetings planned for the next forty-eight hours than in the last few weeks. He wanted to know if the revolution was coming. Sergei understood Indy's position, but denied that the revolution was emanate. Lenin had just left the country to rest in <a href="/index.php?title=Finland&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Finland (page does not exist)">Finland</a>. Sergei asked him what kind of revolution starts when its leader is out of the country. Sergei also stated that the majority of the Russian people weren't ready to embrace the revolution yet.
</p><p>Later in the day, the French Ambassador called a meeting, asking for appraisals of the situation. Indy refuted Brossard's arguments by telling them that Lenin was out of the country. A report arrived to confirm what Indy had just said. The ambassador was impressed and pleased. A few hours later, Indy and Prostrate were summoned from the basement to the Ambassador's crisis room. An uprising began an hour earlier. As they arrived, reports were coming in from all over the city - bridges were blocked, Lenin was returning from Finland and Trotsky was addressing the crowds.
Indy was assigned to man the phones, taking reports from field agents. He heard a report about Sergei inciting the steelworkers and grew angry that he was lied to. Other reports started to come in stating that Lenin had returned to help Trotsky calm the crowds. They were telling people that it was not yet time for the revolution. Other reports stated that the Cossacks hadsided with the provincial government and were ready to fire on any marchers. The people were listening to the Bolshevik leaders and a bloodbath was inevitable. Indy went to Sergei to warn him against marching, but was unheeded. Disgusted, he headed home where he met Rosa. He told her all about what had happened and she decided to try to talk to Sergei herself. He followed her. Along the way, they saw Cossack snipers along the rooftops. They reached the square, shouting a warning just as the snipers opened fire. Sergei was one of the first to be shot and died in a crying Irena's arms. All total, four hundred people died that day. Lenin fled the country and the revolution didn't happen until later in October.

</div>
<p>In July, Indy was stationed in <a href="/wiki/Barcelona" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. There he met his colleagues in a cafe. They were <a href="/index.php?title=Marcello&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Marcello (page does not exist)">Marcello</a>, an Italian, Charles, a Frenchman and <a href="/index.php?title=Cunningham&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Cunningham (page does not exist)">Cunningham</a> from <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. The three told Indy that their ongoing assignment was to try to influence neutral Spain into the war on the side of the Allies. Their German opposites were being led by a Colonel Schmidt, who was Germany's cultural attache to Spain. They also informed Indy to get a job somewhere in the city, for cover.
</p><p>As he wandered the city in search of employment, Indy saw a poster advertising the El Ballet Ruso and that an old acquaintance, <a href="/wiki/Pablo_Picasso" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, was doing the set decorations. He went to the theater and was reunited with Picasso, who first mistook Indy for <a href="/wiki/Norman_Rockwell" title="Norman Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a>. Picasso introduced Indy to <a href="/index.php?title=Mr._Diaguilev&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mr. Diaguilev (page does not exist)">Mr. Diaguilev</a>, the head of the ballet who, after making Indy remove his pants so he could see Indy's legs, offered Indy a job. Unfortunately, it was as a dancer in the ballet, playing a eunuch in a production of Scherazade.
</p><p>Indy returned to their headquarters, located under a barber shop, and told the other three of his attempts at finding a job. They told him that he should keep the position at the ballet. <a href="/index.php?title=Schmidt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Schmidt (page does not exist)">Schmidt</a> had fallen in love with the chief ballerina. They were convinced that there was no better cover for him. The next day, Indy met the chief ballerina, Nadia. Schmidt also arrived to court <a href="/index.php?title=Nadia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nadia (page does not exist)">Nadia</a>, but winded up exchanging cross words with Picasso before she could separate the two.
</p><p>That evening, Indy and Cunningham were at the harbor observing boat movements. Cunningham stressed to Indy the importance of keeping track of the movements of German submarines, even though it seemed to Indy that he was turned it into a hobby similar to train spotting. Cunningham also congratulated Indy on his work so far, but was disappointed that Schmidt wasn't in love with a duchess or other royalty. That would really cause a scandal. Indy suggested that they create the illusion that Schmidt was having an affair with a Contessa. In other words, they set him up.
The next day during practice, Indy sneaked into Nadia's dressing room to steal one of Schmidt's love letters. He was almost caught by Nadia's costumer, but she was nearly deaf and didn't hear him. Nadia did catch him in her dressing room, but he managed to sweet talk his way out of trouble and landed a date for lunch as well. He also managed to steal one of Schmidt's letters right out from under Nadia's nose.
</p><p>Back at headquarters, Marcello forged a copy of the letter, but addressed it to the Contessa of Toledo. The plan called for them to make the Count think that Schmidt was infatuated with the Contessa, starting the scandal they need. The next day Indy picked up Nadia for lunch. She spotted him sneaking the letter back to where he got it, but didn't say anything until they had eaten. Indy said he read the letter because he was jealous of the count. Nadia appeared to be touched and changed the subject.
</p>

<p>Later, Marcello impersonated Schmidt and stoppeds the Contessa for directions. Appearing grateful, he kissed her hand, which did not go unnoticed by the Count's chauffeur. Later, the chauffeur went to pick up the Count, but was stopped by a diversion set by Charles and Cunningham. Indy sneaked into the car to plant the forged letter, but winded up getting trapped inside. He was able to escape without being discovered. The Count discovered the letter and was infuriated.
That evening before the ballet's performance, Nadia discovered that her letter was traced. She wrote a note to Schmidt warning him and gave it to the old costume lady to deliver. Indy went to see Nadia, but she brushed him off. He discovered that she knew about the plan and had sent a message to Schmidt. He couldn't get to the other three to tell them as he was rushed onto stage as the ballet began. Meanwhile, Marcello, Charles and Cunningham sat in one of the private balconies. They sent a note to Schmidt, allegedly from the Contessa, whose acknowledgment was noticed by an irate Count.
</p><p>On stage, Nadia noticed that the old costume lady was heading in the wrong direction. She tried to signal her, but to no avail. On stage, Indy tried to signal the other three to intercept the old woman and the note. Meanwhile, the trio had sent Schmidt another note, whose response further infuriated the Count. Indy succeeded in signaling the trio in Morse code by flashing a spotlight off of a jewel on his costume's codpiece. Being the Ballet Ruso however, Indy's pelvic gyrations were interpreted as part of the show and he was given a standing ovation.
</p><p>The trio were unsuccessful at stopping the old woman, but she delivered the note to the wrong box anyway. After the ballet, an enraged Count challenged Schmidt to a duel. Nadia tried to warn Schmidt but was stopped by Indy who tied her up and put her in a closet. Indy then told the other three what happened and they were ecstatic. An hour or so later, Indy had changed and let Nadia out of the closet. She told him that Schmidt was an American double agent and that she was his contact. Indy took her to headquarters where they got confirmation of her story. By the time the verification arrived however, it was almost time for the duel. Marcello, Charles and Cunningham immediately hatched a number of ludicrous plans to stop the duel, but Nadia suggested telling the truth. In order to do that, they had to go to the theater to get the letter that Marcello forged. Upon searching Nadia's dressing room for it to no avail, they raced down to the basement and retrieved it before it is burned with the trash.
</p><p>They raced to the bullfight arena and stopped the duel just as the bullets were about to fly. After some quick explanations, the duel was called off. This put the four spies back to where they started.

<p>In August, Indy met with his espionage counterparts and was told that due to his outstanding performance in the field he had been reassigned by French Intelligence to work for <a href="/index.php?title=Colonel_Clouseau&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Colonel Clouseau (page does not exist)">Colonel Clouseau</a>. Indy headed to <a href="/index.php?title=Amsterdam&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Amsterdam (page does not exist)">Amsterdam</a> to meet his contact and find out the details of his mission. His contact, disguised as a blind man, told him he had to go to <a href="/wiki/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a> in the heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, set up residence in an apartment and wait for a phone call from a double agent which would come in three days. He was told that the phone call is of momentous importance in helping to end the war.
</p><p>Indy traveled to Prague disguised as a ladies underwear salesman named Amadeus Shooblegrueber. Upon arriving in Prague, Indy met Clouseau, who was disguised as a street merchant, and got the key to the apartment he was to receive the phone call in. Indy immediately fell asleep in the apartment and awoke the next morning to discover that the apartment's phone was removed by the authorities. Indy was told to go to the Ministry of Telephones in order to get a phone installed.
</p><p>After getting sent back and forth between the different departments in the Ministry of Telephones, Indy was told that his phone needed to be reported as stolen and was given a form which needed four stamps from four different places in order to get a new phone put in the apartment. The form, after getting the first stamp on it, accidentally blew out an open window and Indy risked his life chasing after it.

<p>Finally retrieving the form, Indy headed to the police department to get the first of the four stamps he needed. After arriving at the police station Indy was given a ridiculously long form which he had to fill out twice in two different languages. Indy was then brought into an interrogation room and began to worry that the police must have somehow found out that he was a spy. The police interrogated Indy and tried to get him to "confess," however, Indy had no idea what he was supposed to be confessing to. Indy swore he was just trying to report a missing telephone. Indy ended up in court, was found guilty and was locked in jail.
</p><p>The next morning, Indy told the guard that he'd been imprisoned due to an error and was given a form to fill out. After filling out the form, Indy was released along with his original form and the stamp he needed on it. Indy then went to the Ministry of Insurance to get the next stamp he needed only to find out that he first needed to fill out form "27A." Indy went to four different offices trying to find it only to learn from <a href="/wiki/Franz_Kafka" title="Franz Kafka">Franz Kafka</a> that form 27A was superseded by form 27B. Indy exploded at Kafka telling him all of the trouble he'd been through and demanded to get his phone only to find out that he was in the wrong office. Kafka decided to help Indy track down the form.
</p><p>They located the filling cabinet that had the form in it, but learned that the cabinet was locked and the key had been lost. Indy and Kafka tried bringing the heavy cabinet to the basement so the janitor could unlock it and ended up riding the cabinet down the winding stair case, destroying half of the building in the process. The cabinet smashed, Indy got form 27B and his original form got the third stamp.
</p><p>Indy returned to the Ministry of Telephones, got the final stamp and was told that the phone would be installed the following morning. The phone was installed, however, the workers informed him that someone from the connections department would be along in a few weeks to connect it. Indy finally managed to get the phone hooked up by dangling outside of his third story window with seconds to spare only to receive the call from the doubleagent who told him that he had to go to Berlin and arrange to have a phone installed.

<p>By October 1917, Indy was again in Africa, working for French intelligence in Cairo, disguised as a beggar. During that time the British forces had attacked the Turks in <a href="/index.php?title=Gaza&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gaza (page does not exist)">Gaza</a> twice and failed. The General wanted to be in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> by Christmas by taking <a href="/index.php?title=Beersheba&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Beersheba (page does not exist)">Beersheba</a>. Indy's old friend, <a href="/wiki/T.E._Lawrence" title="T.E. Lawrence" class="mw-redirect">T.E. Lawrence</a> pointed out that that would mean crossing the desert and there was not a drop of water between them and Beersheba. Colonel <a href="/wiki/Richard_Meinertzhagen" title="Richard Meinertzhagen">Richard Meinertzhagen</a> said that they could make it if the men traveled light and made a lightening dash across the desert. The whole operation, however, would depend on the wells in Beersheba being full of water. They also would need to begin a major espionage campaign to make the Turks believe that they intended to continue their main attack on Gaza and put a trusted agent in Beersheba who spoke both Arabic and Turkish to keep a watch over the wells. Lawrence said he knew the man they wanted. Indy's commander told him he'd been reassigned to the British and was to report to Meinertzhagen. Indy told his commander that Meinertzhagen was the lunatic who almost got him killed in Africa when he was assigned to the 25th Royal Fusiliers to blow up a German train.
</p><p>Indy reported to Meinertzhagen and was taken bird watching with the Colonel and <a href="/index.php?title=John_%22Jack%22_Anders&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John &quot;Jack&quot; Anders (page does not exist)">John "Jack" Anders</a> who was part of the Australian Light Horse Brigade. The Turks attacked them and Meinertzhagen was shot in the shoulder. The three managed to escape, however, the bag they were carrying with their orders was dropped and taken by the Turks. When the three returned to the base camp, Indy learned that Meinertzhagen faked getting shot with the use of calf's blood and meant to have the Turks steal the bag which contained fake plans of an attack on Gaza. T.E. Lawrence arrived and Indy learned that he was the one who got Indy involved in this operation.
</p><p>Lawrence and Meinertzhagen explained to Indy how the 50,000 British troops that would march across the desert over a period of two days to attack Beersheba would only be carrying one canteen of water each and thus if they couldn't take Beersheba the same day they arrived with the wells intact and full of water they would be stranded in the middle of the desert and die. Indy's mission was to do everything he could to protect the wells. Indy and Ned talked over dinner and Indy told him how he and his father didn't talk much anymore. Jack arrived and introduced Indy to the rest of his troop.
</p><p>Later, Indy asked Jack why the Australians were not fighting in the war. Jack told him that the British kept them in reserves most of the time because they didn't trust them. Jack told them how they were an infantry division that rode in quickly on their horses and then proceeded on foot.
</p><p>Indy and <a href="/index.php?title=Dex&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dex (page does not exist)">Dex</a>, one of the Australians, had a friendly horse race on the beach and Indy lost. The next day Ned and Meinertzhagen woke Indy and told him that he was to travel to Beersheba disguised as a merchant and contact another agent named <a href="/index.php?title=Kazim_(spy)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kazim (spy) (page does not exist)">Kazim</a>. He was given boots with a hidden knife in the right one and told he'd be traveling with another agent named <a href="/wiki/Maya_(spy)" title="Maya (spy)">Maya</a> who would be traveling in the guise of a belly dancer. Indy practiced throwing his knife before he headed out, but didn't have any luck hitting the target. He said his goodbyes to Jack and the other Australians and left with Ned and Meinertzhagen.
</p><p>They met up with Maya and Indy said goodbye to Ned. Maya asked Indy if they were heading to Gaza or Beersheba, but Indy told her that she was on a "need to know" basis and she'd be briefed when the time came. They camped for the night and Indy again practiced with his knife, but he still hadn't improved.
</p><p>The next day Jack told the rest of his troop that they'd just gotten orders to move out, but they hadn't yet been told where they were headed. Indy arrived in Beersheba and bribed his way past the troops. He met up with Kazim and learned about the wells being wired with explosives. Kazim told him that so far Colonel <a href="/index.php?title=Ismet_Bey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ismet Bey (page does not exist)">Ismet Bey</a>, head of the Turkish garrison, had been denied reinforcements from Gaza. The wells, however, were rigged because Bey thought the British did intend to come to Beersheba.
</p><p>Indy sent a courier pigeon back to the base with a note about the wells. Kazim pointed out Bey and Captain <a href="/wiki/Schiller" title="Schiller">Schiller</a>, head of German intelligence, to Indy who were eating in his cantina. Maya performed a belly dance and gave Bey one of her veils. After leaving the cantina, Bey removed the note from Maya hidden in the veil and learned that she still didn't know where the British planned on attacking. Kazim told Indy that tomorrow they would have to cut the wires to the wells individually.
</p><p>Indy met with Maya and asked her to dance for Colonel Bey again tomorrow at exactly 1300 hours. Maya asked if this meant that the attack would be on Beersheba, but Indy didn't confirm it. Indy and Maya spent the night together which caused Indy to arrive late for his meeting with Kazim. Kazim was caught digging up a wire at one of the wells as the British arrived at Beersheba. Bey tried contacting General von Christenstein to send troops from Gaza, but Schiller believed the British troops were a diversion for the real attack on Gaza and stopped him from making the call.

<p>Australian Commander Harry George Chauver ordered the British troops to advance and the Australian Light Horse Brigade to be kept in reserve. The attack began and Indy wrote a message to the British informing them that the plan had failed and Kazim had been arrested. He told Maya that the real attack was at Beersheba and she shot the pigeon carrying the message so the British wouldn't have any warning that reinforcements would be arriving from Gaza. She brought Indy to Bey and informed them about the British attack. Schiller had Kazim brought in and told Bey that he was beaten into admitting that the attack on Beersheba was a diversion and that they knew Maya was a double agent who they used to feed the false information to. Indy tried to stop Kazim from telling them that the real attack was on Gaza, but was unsuccessful. Indy broke free and stabbed Kazim in the chest with his knife.
</p><p>Indy was locked up and Kazim's body was removed. Schiller told Bey that there would be no reinforcements. Chauver ordered the Australian Light Horse Brigade to charge Beersheba instead of the British Cavalry in order to surprise the Turks. Kazim, far from dead, managed to slip away and managed to free Indy. They began cutting the wires to the explosives as the Australians advanced fast enough to ride in under the Turkish guns. Bey examined the knife Indy used to "kill" Kazim and found out that it was a trick knife. Indy and Kazim managed to cut the wires around all of the wells except for one. Bey ordered the wells to be blown up and the final well that Indy and Kazim were working on explodes. Indy told Kazim that they needed to stop them from rewiring the other six wells.
</p><p>Dex was shot dead as the Australians kept advancing. The Australians reached the garrison and began fighting the Turks. Indy and Kazim went to the tower where the main switch board controlling the explosives was. Bey fled the garrison as Schiller held off Indy and Kazim with a machine gun. Jack arrived on his horse and knocked the gun from Schiller's hands. Schiller ran into the tower and ordered the explosives to be blown. Indy arrived just in time to shoot the Turk before he pulled the switch. Schiller jumped Indy and the two fought. Indy managed to shoot Schiller seconds before he could blow the explosives. The Light Horse Brigade managed to take the garrison. Indy told Jack that it looked like they would be able to be in Jerusalem by Christmas to which Jack replied that he couldn't think of a better place he'd rather be at that time. The troops were finally able to relax and take a well deserved drink.

</dd><dd>&#8213;Indiana Jones courting Giulietta.<sup class="noprint"><a href="/wiki/Tales_of_Innocence" title="Tales of Innocence">[src]</a></sup> 
</dd></dl>
<p>In November 1917, Indy was stationed in the mountains of Northern <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, sneaking behind the German lines trying to persuade Czech conscripts in the Austrian army to desert. To this end, he had been meeting with some soldiers in an abandoned tunnel, making plans for their defection. While he was in town, he courted <a href="/wiki/Giulietta" title="Giulietta">Giulietta</a>, an Italian girl.
</p><p>After one of his missions, he met with another spy who gave him documents to take back across the lines. After he got back across no man's land to the Italian side, he washed up and headed out to see his girlfriend. On the way there, he hitched a ride with two American ambulance drivers. One of them, <a href="/index.php?title=Joe&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Joe (page does not exist)">Joe</a>, noticed Indy's Belgian uniform and made fun of him. Indy pretended not to understand and replied with insults in French. When they arrived at the village, Indy thanked them for the ride in English, embarrassing the loudmouth and giving the other one a good laugh.
</p><p>When Indy went to Giulietta's house outside of town, he presented her with a single red rose. As she went to put it in water, her grandmother pointed out that another suitor brought her a whole bouquet of roses. She told him that he'd have to do better. Later, Indy was drowning his sorrows at a bar, when in walked the other ambulance driver. He introduced himself as <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>. Indy told Ernie his problems and that he was afraid that the other guy was winning. Ernie told him that love was like war and that he should fight for his girl. The two got drunk and Ernie promised to help him.
</p><p>A few days later, Indy was back across the German lines to meet his group of potential deserters. When he got to the meeting place, he found it empty. One of them arrived and said that the others were held up in the reserve lines and wouldn't be back until the next day. They'd cross over to the Italian side then.
</p><p>Back on the Italian side, Indy changed and went to see Giulietta, armed with a dozen roses and three bars of soap as a present. The other man had bought a couple of bouquets of flowers as well as a box of chocolates. Indy suggested that they went for a walk, but they wound up being chaperoned by her grandmother. Indy wanted to be alone with Giulietta, so he ran, dragging her along. They lost her grandmother in the bustle of the village square.

<p>Up on a hillside outside of town, Indy impressed her with the danger that he faced. They kissed, but unfortunately her grandmother finally catched up with them. The next day across the German lines, Indy was told that the Germans were planning an offensive in seventy-two hours. He then lead the defectors across no man's land. The Germans opened fire on their own, but the Italians fired back and the defectors made it across.
</p><p>That night at Giulietta's, she played piano while her father played the cello. <a href="/index.php?title=Umberto&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Umberto (page does not exist)">Umberto</a>, her brother, told Indy that the other suitor played cello as well. Indy told her mother that he played the flute, an instrument she found romantic. She invited him for supper the next evening, the occasion being Giulietta's birthday.
</p><p>Later, he tried to borrow a flute from a musician. Unfortunately, modern flutes were different from the ancient ones Indy knew how to play. He had to settle for a soprano sax. Ernie told him that he couldn't fail. The evening of Giulietta's birthday, Indy showed up armed with flowers, gifts and the sax. Her father was upset and rushed into the kitchen to confront her mother. He had invited the other suitor for dinner. When Giulietta heard the news she burst into tears. While the family fought in the kitchen, the doorbell rang. Indy answered it and found Ernie. It slowly dawned on them both that he was the other suitor. Before they could come to blows, the family arrived to announce that dinner was ready.
</p><p>During dinner, Indy and Ernie tried to out do each other, both of them heaping compliments on the food. After the meal, Ernie excused himself. Before Indy could say a word though, the sounds of the cello drifted into the room. Giulietta went into the living room and began to accompany Ernie on the piano. Indy grabbed his sax and the three broke into a spirited version of The William Tell Overture. As Indy and Ernie left, they got into an argument on the front lawn, vowing war.
</p><p>A few nights later, Ernie showed up to serenade Giulietta on the concertina. Indy arrived a few moments later with a small band of troubadours. Things began to escalate between the two. Ernie intercepted a shipment of flowers from Indy. Indy put itching powder in Ernie's shorts. Eventually, the two decided that they were getting no place with their fighting. They went to see Giulietta to have her choose between them. When they got there, they found her being fitted for a wedding dress. She was marrying an old friend - <a href="/wiki/Alfredo" title="Alfredo">Alfredo</a>.
</p><p>On the way back to the barracks, they argued, oblivious to the German planes bombing the road around them. Ernie catched some shrapnel in the leg. As Indy ran to help him, he got caught in a blast and knocked unconscious. Ernie somehow managed to pull Indy to cover.
</p><p>As they recovered in the Army hospital, Ernie got the medal he'd always wanted. Indy got word that he was being shipped to <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>. They agreed to look each other up after the war. They also agreed never to chase the same girl again, just as a pretty nurse came into the ward.
</p><p>After being wounded in action, Indy was transferred to North Africa where he joined the French Foreign Legion, in <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. While trying to uncover the identity of a traitor in his own ranks, Indy battled hostile Berber tribesmen, and engaged in an innocent flirtation with author <a href="/wiki/Edith_Wharton" title="Edith Wharton">Edith Wharton</a>.

<p>By September 1918, Indy was in <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and had passed through <a href="/index.php?title=Ankara&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ankara (page does not exist)">Ankara</a>, where he had lost a bet with his partner, <a href="/index.php?title=Stefan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stefan (page does not exist)">Stefan</a>.

His own cover was that of a Swedish journalist named Nils Anderson.

<p>While there, Indy fell in love with <a href="/wiki/Molly_Walder" title="Molly Walder">Molly Walder</a> — an American schoolteacher working at an orphanage school run by <a href="/wiki/Halide_Edib" title="Halide Edib">Halide Edib</a> — but kept his identity as a spy from her. One day, Indy was speaking at the orphanage and learned that Edib knew Kemal. He asked her to see about the possibility of an interview with him for an article on Turkish nationals. He also made plans with Molly for a special dinner that night at <a href="/index.php?title=Pera_Palace&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pera Palace (page does not exist)">Pera Palace</a>. At dinner, Jones asked her, as Nils, to marry him and she accepted his proposal. As he didn't have a ring, he gave her a bracelet instead.
</p><p>Later that night, Indy met <a href="/index.php?title=Sadallah&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sadallah (page does not exist)">a colleague</a> in an alleyway. He was told that "The Red Document" would arrive on Tuesday. Indy said that didn't give them much time for what they had planned, but they had no choice. The next day, he found out that Kemal had agreed to the interview. During the interview, he asked Kemal about Turkey's alliance with Germany. Kemal was not happy with it, stating that Germany's aims were different from Turkey's. He didn't care what the Germans wanted, he just wanted to maintain the integrity of Turkey. Indy asked him if he would be interested in a separate peace with France. Kemal got a little suspicious and asked Indy if he had the authority to make such an offer. Indy hinted that he did. Aware that his staff could overhear their conversation in the next room, Kemal told him that he was in no position to consider such an offer but secretly made plans to meet with Indy again.
</p><p>Back at the news bureau, Indy received a message that <a href="/index.php?title=Monty&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Monty (page does not exist)">their courier</a> was to be met within half an hour. With Stefan warning him to be careful, Jones rushed to meet him. While waiting at the drop-off sight, he saw the courier struck by a truck while crossing the street. Indy rushed to the dying man's side but the documents that he was carrying in a briefcase were stolen amid the commotion. Indy called a meeting of the entire station and informed them that the documents contained the French terms for a separate peace. The Turkish Army had become more disillusioned with the Sultan and would be willing to follow Kemal. But if people loyal to the Sultan got ahold of the documents, Kemal could be considered a traitor. They concluded that the only one who could have known of the documents arrival was <a href="/index.php?title=Vescari&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vescari (page does not exist)">Vescari</a>, a black marketeer.
</p><p>The next day, there was a diplomatic reception at the palace and Indy was invited as member of the Swedish press. Sultan <a href="/index.php?title=Mehmed_VI&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mehmed VI (page does not exist)">Mehmed VI</a> greeted him, stating that it was good to see impartial observers working there considering the amount of propaganda against the Turks and Germans. Later, a contact met Indy and confirmed that Vescari did have the documents, but would not sell. Aware the Germans knew of Monty's "special consignment", a small group of four, including Indy and Stefan, went to Vescari's apartment, but found him drowned in the bathtub. Indy heard a noise in the main room and was attacked by a man with a knife, who cut him in the arm. They chased the man to the city rooftops. When Indy and Stefan finally cornered the man, who was carrying the documents, he told them that Vescari was tipped off by an insider from Indy's group. He then tried to flee again, but Stefan hit him and he fell to the street below, dead.
</p><p>Indy called another meeting at the station where he reviewed the documents. They were not what he expected. If they had fallen into the wrong hands, Kemal would have definitely been branded a traitor. Indy didn't trust anyone in the group and said he was having background checks run on everyone. He then hid the letter. Going to bed that night, Indy developed a fever from his knife wound and while he slept, his apartment was broken into and searched. Not finding what he was looking for, the intruder left.
The next morning, Molly visited Indy. She ordered him to bed and dressed the wound properly. She came back in the evening and made him dinner. He told her he was stabbed while gathering research for an article on the black market. They also discussed their wedding. She decided that she wanted to spend the night. The next morning, he walked her back to the orphanage. It was raining and he gave her his overcoat. Along the way, they saw a fortune teller and she asked if their love would last forever. The fortune teller said yes, but after they left, she saw something else in the runes that distressed her.
</p><p>Later, Indy was walking to the office, when he felt that he was being followed. He turned, and a man gave him a slip of paper which told him to be at a certain place at six o'clock. It was the rendezvous for his meeting with Kemal. He retrieved the documents from their hiding spot and told Stefan where he was going. Stefan was against his going, but Indy was insistent. He told Stefan that if anything happened, he'd be in charge as Stefan was the only one Indy trusted.
At the rendezvous spot, Indy was met by two Turkish soldiers who took him to see Kemal. Indy gave him the document. Kemal read it and was furious. It was not what he wanted or expected. Indy suggested negotiating with the French, but Kemal refused. He would achieve his dream of a free Turkey on his own terms. Indy left.
</p><p>On his way home, Indy was stopped by one of his fellow spies, Sadallah. He told him that he had just received word from headquarters as to who the double agent could have been. Before he could tell Indy, however, he was shot by a man in an alleyway. The police began to arrive and Indy had no choice but to get away. He called a meeting with the rest of the station. He had decided to shut down operations for a while and everyone was to lay low. Molly came to him at the news agency, very upset. Her employer had received a letter calling Indy a spy for the French and wanted to know if it was true. Jones admitted the truth and claimed that he had to lie in order to protect her, insisting that his love for her was real. Hurt and betrayed, Molly left telling him that she never wanted to see him again.
</p><p>Later, at the orphanage, Molly spent some time thinking. She then put on Indy's overcoat and left. Meanwhile, Indy was still at the office, when gun shots ripped through the door. They missed him and he ran into the street, headed towards his apartment. He knew he was being followed. At the apartment, he burned the documents and built a dummy for the pursuer to shoot at. As he hid by the door, he heard the other man slowly start to enter and take aim at the dummy. Just then, the door downstairs opened and a figure wearing an overcoat walked in. Thinking it was Indy, the other man turned and shot, hitting Molly, who had come to see Indy. Indy charged out onto the landing and saw that it was Stefan who was trying to kill him. Indy shot him dead. He ran to Molly's side, but she was dying. She told him that she still loved him and still wanted to get married. She then died in his arms.

While trying to leave, they met the master of the castle, and Indy experienced another brush with the supernatural - Targo was revealed to be a vampire that had created a personal army of undead soldiers. Indy succeeded in killing the vampire, believed by some to be <a href="/index.php?title=Vlad_Tepes&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vlad Tepes (page does not exist)">Vlad the Impaler</a>, which freed the soldiers from Targo's influence and allowed them to finally rest in peace.

<p>By November, Indy and Remy had been assigned back to the trenches with orders to arrest a Corporal named <a href="/index.php?title=Bajendra_Sing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bajendra Sing (page does not exist)">Bajendra Sing</a> who was believed to be exchanging munitions data with the Germans.

<p>Indy and Remy resigned their commissions in the Belgian Army and returned to England where Remy was reunited with his wife <a href="/wiki/Suzette" title="Suzette" class="mw-redirect">Suzette</a> and step children. When <a href="/wiki/Miss_Seymour" title="Miss Seymour" class="mw-redirect">Miss Seymour</a> failed to show up at the train station to meet him, Indy went to her house to discover that Miss Seymour died from a fever a week earlier. Indy read a letter left to him by Miss Seymour telling him that she wished him to make peace with his father and make something of himself with his life.
</p><p>Indy stayed with Remy and his wife for a while and Remy told him that he had the map translated. They discovered that the map they possessed may be able to lead them to one of the diamond eyes from a golden peacock statue originally owned by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>. When wine was accidentally spilled on the map, Indy noticed that there was secret writing on the map that could only be seen when wet. They writing gave them a starting point for their treasure hunt and the two traveled to <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>.
</p><p>They discovered that archaeologist <a href="/wiki/Howard_Carter" title="Howard Carter">Howard Carter</a> (who Indy met in Egypt in 1908) was staying at the hotel they had checked into. Indy and Remy found another clue at a museum in a stone tombstone dating back to Alexander the Great's time. They met a German man with an eye-patch at the museum who was drawing the tombstone. Back at the hotel they met up with Carter and novelist <a href="/wiki/E._M._Forster" title="E. M. Forster">E. M. Forster</a>. While Indy worked on translating the inscription from the tomb, he discovered that a key was needed to be placed on the map in order to find out the exact location of the temple they were searching for.
</p><p>Indy and Remy were attacked in their room by the German man with the eye-patch (who turned out to be the soldier who murdered Sing in an earlier attempt to get the map) and a group of thugs. They beat off the men, but the map was stolen. In searching the German man's room they found that he had left on a steamship, unfortunately they found out that they missed the boat he left on by a half an hour.
</p><p>They headed after the German by train and arrived in Port Said where they boarded the ship that the German was on. Peaking through the German's window, they watched as he placed the key on the map to get the location and then burnt the map. Failing to see where the key pointed to, they decided to follow him to the temple and disembark the boat at <a href="/index.php?title=Java&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Java (page does not exist)">Java</a>.
</p><p>They checked into the hotel where the German was staying and met a woman named <a href="/index.php?title=Lily&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lily (page does not exist)">Lily</a> who was sitting at the table with the German and a group of people. She told them a little about the various people: <a href="/index.php?title=Ku_Wong&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ku Wong (page does not exist)">Ku Wong</a>, <a href="/index.php?title=Jambi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jambi (page does not exist)">Jambi</a>, a tobacco trader, and <a href="/index.php?title=Jongrann&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jongrann (page does not exist)">Jongrann</a>, a diamond trader. After she left they overheard the three men call the German Zyke and that they had financed his expedition. They needed to get the diamond to a "fat man" in Singapore who would pay triple the black market price within a week or he would be gone.

<p>They followed <a href="/index.php?title=Zyke&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Zyke (page does not exist)">Zyke</a> on horseback to the temple and managed to find a locked box believed to contain the diamond before he could. Zyke found them and took the box, however, Indy managed to steal the key from him which was needed to open the box. Indy and Remy returned to Zyke's room in the hotel where they found him dead. They found a ticket for a boat going to <a href="/index.php?title=Singapore&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Singapore (page does not exist)">Singapore</a> and found that Ku Wong, Jambi and Jongrann were also aboard.
</p><p>Indy met up with Lily again who was aboard, but had no money. He let her stay in his cabin as he sat off to search for the box with the diamond in the cabins of the other three men. Remy tried to distract the men with a game of cards while Indy searched, however Jongrann returned to his cabin before Indy could search the room. Indy and Remy both sneaked into his room while he slept, but Jongrann woke up and pulled a gun on them. Before he could shoot, however, pirates boarded the ship and started attacking everyone. Indy briefly engaged in a ferocious duel of lightning-fast kicks using Northern Style Kung-Fu against a pirate using the the same style of martial arts, and barely emerged victorious.  The female pirate captain, who turned out to be Jin Ming, the singer from the ship's nightclub, demanded everyone's possessions and Indy and Remy were surprised to find that Lily had the box. She told Indy that she was the one who shot Zyke; he was supposed to be her partner, but he was going to kill her.
</p><p>The pirates also took the key from Indy. The pirates left and Indy, Remy and Lily followed after them in a lifeboat. The three sneaked aboard the pirate ship and managed to retrieve the box. The pirates attacked and Lily was shot dead as she tried to escape with the box by herself. A fire broke out on the ship and as the pirates fleed on a lifeboat with the box, Indy and Remy followed on another lifeboat in pursuit. Both lifeboats ran ashore on an island and everyone was attacked by headhunters. Remy managed to retrieve the box in the brief battle and he and Indy sat out to sea again.
</p><p>Eventually, they landed on another island and were captured by a group of natives who took them back to their village. Indy and Remy managed to show that they meant them no harm and the natives gave them food and shelter. The next morning Indy befriended a small native boy named <a href="/index.php?title=Biok&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Biok (page does not exist)">Biok</a>, but later that day Indy and Remy were tied up during an initiation ceremony for the younger male tribe members.
</p><p>A tribe from a neighboring island arrived on boat and a ceremonial battle was played out. During the battle, Indy managed to free himself, but he ran to the aid of Biok when he saw him get hit by a spear. The boy died and was carried back to the village by both of the tribes.
</p><p>The next day, Indy and Remy departed with the neighboring tribes and were taken back to their village where they met anthropologist <a href="/wiki/Bronislaw_Malinowski" title="Bronislaw Malinowski">Bronislaw Malinowski</a>. He told them that the tribes did not want to fight, but did so because the "ghosts" wanted them to battle. Indy and Remy learned that a freighter came by occasionally and that they would be able to get back to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>.
</p><p>Back at Malinowski's house, Indy and Remy managed to pry open the box. Instead of finding a diamond inside, however, they found a stone and Remy exploded in rage. Over dinner, Malinowski told them how he was documenting the culture of this tribe so that it wouldn't be lost when it eventually changed. Remy returned to his room and Indy told Malinowski how they had been treasure hunting. Indy said how he'd like to eventually return to the states and attend the University of Chicago to study archaeology.

<p>The next morning Indy showed Malinowski the stone which had an inscription on it. Together they worked on translating it and discovered what may be a clue as to the diamonds whereabouts. Indy began to see how the treasure hunt had begun to become an obsession to Remy and began to wonder if he wanted to continue on in search of the diamond.
Later, Malinowski asked Indy what he would do once he had found the diamond. Indy replied that he'd return to the states and attend college. Malinowski pointed out that was exactly what he wanted to do before he began his treasure hunt and that it was foolish to waste his time searching for something he did not really need while he could be pursuing his real dream.
</p><p>Indy later told Remy that he was not going to continue on the search, but instead he was returning to the states. Remy tried to talk him out of it and, when he realized that Indy would not change his mind, he told him that he would continue on alone. Indy and Remy left on the freighter and eventually went their separate ways. Indy didn't know it then, but years later he would once again find himself searching for the diamond.

<p>By May 1919, The Germans had surrendered to the Allies and the Kaiser had abdicated and fled the country. The leaders of the Allied countries had gathered in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> for the peace conference. The three main heads of the conference were French Premier <a href="/index.php?title=George_Clemenceau&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="George Clemenceau (page does not exist)">George Clemenceau</a>, British Prime Minister <a href="/index.php?title=David_Lloyd-George&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="David Lloyd-George (page does not exist)">David Lloyd-George</a> and United States President <a href="/index.php?title=Woodrow_Wilson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Woodrow Wilson (page does not exist)">Woodrow Wilson</a>. Indy had secured a job with the American delegation as a translator. His boss was pleased with his work and said that there would be a job available for him in the State Department when the conference was over.
</p><p>While there, Indy ran into <a href="/wiki/T.E._Lawrence" title="T.E. Lawrence" class="mw-redirect">T.E. Lawrence</a>, who was helping to see that <a href="/index.php?title=Arabia&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Arabia (page does not exist)">Arabia</a> was awarded her independence. He believes that colonialism was dead now that dozens of countries were petitioning the conference for their freedom. He invited Indy along for dinner. At dinner, Ned introduced <a href="/index.php?title=Gertrude_Bell&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gertrude Bell (page does not exist)">Gertrude Bell</a>, a writer who had been championing the Arab cause. They were also joined by a member of the British delegation, <a href="/index.php?title=Arnold_Toynbee&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Arnold Toynbee (page does not exist)">Arnold Toynbee</a>. Toynbee was afraid that the leaders of the conference would give in to the publics' outcries for blood and retribution. Indy tried to defend Wilson, saying that he was a good man. Toynbee said that Wilson was obsessed with his League of Nations idea and would concede anything to get it. The world was changing and history was now moving in a spiral, he said. If they tried to push Germany down now, it would only rise again. He gave Indy some words of advice which he then later wrote in his journal - "Those who forget the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them."

<p>The next day, Wilson addressed the conference about his League of Nations. At dinner afterwards, Ned told Indy and Gertrude about his dreams of a free Arabia. Unfortunately, it seemed that politics may prohibit it. Although <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> promised Arabia its freedom, it also promised Arabia to <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> in exchange for <a href="/index.php?title=Kuwait&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kuwait (page does not exist)">Kuwait</a> and its oil fields.
</p><p>A few days later, Indy was brought to Wilson's study to transcribe a conversation between Wilson, Lloyd-George and Clemenceau. They were arguing over Arabia. Wilson was not happy with Lloyd-George's and Clemenceau's secret agreement. He proposed a commission to find out the will of the people as to who should rule them. The other two reluctantly agreed. 
</p><p>That night at dinner, Indy told Ned what happened. He was happy and felt that this would help free Arabia. However, he planned on not waiting for the commission, but having <a href="/index.php?title=King_Faisal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="King Faisal (page does not exist)">King Faisal</a> present his case to the conference and run rings around Wilson. Indy was not happy with Ned's plan and they argued. Ned finally walked out. Indy went to follow Ned, but was stopped by their Vietnamese waiter, who overheard the whole argument. The waiter wished to talk to Indy, but Indy brushed him off in his haste to catch Ned.
</p><p>Indy did catch up to Ned down the street. Ned apologized, saying that he'd become cynical. He wondered how Indy got through the whole war without losing his ideals. A few days later, King Faisal of Arabia addressed the conference. Ned translated for him. Faisal asked for justice and the fulfillment of England's promise of freedom. He asked that his country not be divided up like war booty for the colonial powers. As Indy was walking home that evening, he was stopped by the Vietnamese waiter, who introduced himself as Nguyen. He said that he was part of a delegation of patriots who wished address the conference, but no one would see them. They were beginning to get desperate. Indy was not sure that he could help, but he would see what he can do. Indy presented the idea to his boss, who was against it. He told Indy to forget what Wilson said about helping all the people of the world. Presidents may come and go, but diplomats would always stay. Indy did manage to persuade him to get the Vietnamese a hearing.
</p><p>Later, the Vietnamese delegation presented their request to some of the diplomats. All they asked for were certain freedoms and a voice in the French Parliament. They were told it would be considered. Outside of the hall, Indy apologized, saying that he wished it could have gone better. Nguyen was happy that they at least got their chance to be heard. Another member of the delegation called him <a href="/index.php?title=Ho_Chi_Min&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ho Chi Min (page does not exist)">Ho Chi Min</a>, which meant "Father of his Country." The delegation then left for home.
</p><p>At dinner, Indy was disgusted that no one seemed to care. Toynbee told him that no one was interested in the common people's interests except for Wilson. The real decisions were being made in private, with the colonial powers carving up the world for themselves. Indy wondered why they fought the war in the first place. Ned arrived and let them know that the German delegation had finally arrived. They were delayed by the French who forced them to take a train ride through some of the worst areas of the battlefield. At the station, the train was met by an angry mob which the police could barely keep back. The German delegation was refused cab service and had to walk to their hotel.
Indy and Ned talked about why they thought the war was fought. Ned originally thought it was to preserve democracy, but now was not sure that it was accomplished. As Indy was walking home, he saw the German delegation being followed by an angry mob of people. He followed them to the hotel, where a porter began throwing out their luggage to the crowd. Indy was close to the front and managed to hand one of the bags back to a young German diplomat.
</p><p>The next day, the Germans came before the conference. Clemenceau said that there would be no negotiating of terms and that the Germans had fifteen days to sign the treaty. Later at the opera, Toynbee joined Indy, Ned and Gertrude. He said that Wilson had finally conceded almost all of his fourteen points. He also said that the terms of German reparation was even harsher than anyone thought that they would be. This plan would bankrupt Germany and perhaps drag the rest of Europe down with it. He predicted that the war would be fought all over again, in ten to twenty years. He also told them that Germany must assume all responsibility for the war.
</p><p>At the conference, the German delegation said that they laid down their arms in accordance with Wilson's fourteen points, but now found that they were not in the treaty. They also refused to bear the guilt of the war. Clemenceau rebuked that the treaty must be accepted. Reluctantly, the head of the German delegation agreed.
Later, at a reception, the young German diplomat walked in. Everyone stopped and stared at him. Indy went over to him and helped him get a cup of coffee. The German recognized him from the hotel. They talked and found out that they both fought at Verdun. The German said that there would be no future for anyone if the rulers at the conference had their way.

<p>After the formal signing ceremonies, there was a large celebration. Indy said that he was glad that it was finally over. Toynbee disagreed, feeling that it is just beginning. As Indy was helping with the packing up of the American delegation's office, he came across the file with the Vietnamese delegation's request. It was stamped with the words "No Action." Indy was then summoned with his boss to President Wilson's office. There, they witnessed another conference between Wilson, Lloyd-George and Clemenceau. Wilson was upset that a commission was not being sent to Arabia. Lloyd-George said that the situation in the Middle East was much too volatile to make a decision now. Instead, he and Clemenceau proposed "Zones of Influence" for England and France. They promised Wilson to find something for King Faisal. Wilson conceded to them. After they left, Wilson was full of doubt. He got his League of Nations, but at what cost?
</p><p>Indy decided to turn down the State Department job and instead plans on returning home and then attending the University of Chicago in the fall to study archaeology. He and Ned promised to stay in touch as they said goodbye at the train station.

Indy was depressed to learn that she married his high school rival <a href="/index.php?title=Butch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Butch (page does not exist)">Butch</a> nearly two years earlier. He was even more depressed by the cold reception he got from his father when he arrived home. Indy's father was angry at Indy for running off to Europe to fight in the war, but tried to act as if he didn't care.

</dd></dl>
<p>By April <a href="/wiki/1920" title="1920">1920</a>, Indy was working his way through college as a waiter at <a href="/wiki/Colosimo%27s_Restaurant" title="Colosimo's Restaurant">Colosimo's Restaurant</a>, home of the best food and the best jazz in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Indy loved jazz, but his admiration was not appreciated by the restaurant's band leader, <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Bechet" title="Sidney Bechet">Sidney Bechet</a>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, at school Indy was not getting along well with his roommate, <a href="/wiki/Eliot_Ness" title="Eliot Ness">Eliot Ness</a>. Eliot was far too uptight, but one evening Indy was able to talk him into going to the Royal Garden, a jazz club. At the club, Sidney and the band were jamming and were joined by a singer named <a href="/index.php?title=Goldie_Williams&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Goldie Williams (page does not exist)">Goldie Williams</a>. Eliot got upset when he was served "Prohibition Water" - gin. He went to leave but ended up causing a commotion after he tripped over another customer. Both he and Indy wound up getting thrown out.
</p><p>The next evening at work, Indy apologized to Sidney for the commotion, but wound up gushing how much he loved jazz. Sidney asked Indy if he'd ever played an instrument and he admitted that he played soprano sax a little bit during the war. Sidney had a soprano sax which he gave to Indy to practice. After work, Indy got to tag along with the band as they performed at a speakeasy, The Four Deuces.
</p><p>For the next couple of weeks, Indy spent his free time playing sax and driving Eliot up a wall. One afternoon, Eliot dragged Indy to a football victory party at a campus frat house. Indy had his sax with him. When a cheerleader Eliot had a crush on saw Indy's sax, she arranged for him to sit in with the band and barber shop quartet that's performing. However, he was kicked out of the party when he started to improvise around "April Showers." He was told that jazz was brothel music and not respectable.

<p>At work, Indy conned Sidney into letting him jam with them on a song at the Four Deuces. Unfortunately, it didn't go as well as Indy had hoped. Sidney gave Indy some pointers on jazz. He told him that he had to learn to walk before he could run. He also instructed Indy to learn "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" forwards and backwards.
One Sunday morning Indy went to a black revival church with Sidney. Some of the other parishioners were uncomfortable with Indy's presence. They went to Goldie's house afterwards for Sunday dinner. Indy learned that her brother, <a href="/index.php?title=C.J.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="C.J. (page does not exist)">C.J.</a>, was in the war and they traded jokes about life in the army. The discussion took a serious turn when C.J. expressed his dissatisfaction with the black plight in America. This lead to an argument with his father about the methods for achieving civil rights.
</p><p>A few nights later, Indy, Sidney, Goldie and C.J. spoke about change. As weeks went on, Indy continued to practice, getting better as he went. One night, Sidney overheard him at work and was impressed with his progress. After work, the band headed over to the Golden Palace to hear Goldie sing. While Sidney was jamming with the band, he invited Indy up on stage and they proceeded to storm through a swinging version of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star”.

<p>Later at the Four Deuces, Indy learned that <a href="/index.php?title=Colosimo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Colosimo (page does not exist)">Colosimo</a> owned the speakeasy.

The next day, as the restaurant was getting ready to open, Colosimo was shot to death in the doorway. No one saw anything, although one waiter had to chase out a customer only a few minutes before the shooting. Indy noticed that Colosimo's rings were gone.

<p>One of the reporters was an old friend of Indy's from the war, <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, who was working as a free-lancer for the Chicago Tribune. Back at Indy's dorm room, they discussed the case. Eliot expressed interest. It seemed that Colosimo's first wife was the one who got him out of bootlegging and into the much more profitable brothel trade. After he made a fortune, he dumped his wife and took up with the singer <a href="/index.php?title=Dale_Winters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dale Winters (page does not exist)">Dale Winters</a>. Ernie was excited by all the gossip, but Eliot suggested solving the crime procedurally, establishing motive, method and opportunity.
</p><p>Their first move was to go to the funeral procession to see who turns up. As the casket was solemnly paraded through the streets, they ran into "Big Al" Brown, a bartender at The Four Deuces who had a nasty scar on his face. Among the dignitaries in the procession were Mayor Bill Thompson, some judges and a couple of congressmen. Indy had to leave the funeral for work where they were holding a reception afterwards. Ernie had a couple of leads he wanted to check out. Eliot had a friend in the morgue and went to see what he could learn.
</p><p>Meeting with the coroner, Eliot learned that Colosimo was shot in the back of the head, possibly as he was looking out the front door's peephole. Ernie hanged out at the police station with some reporters, but learned nothing. They met at a soda fountain for lunch and traded information. Unfortunately, all they had are half formed theories with no evidence to back them up. They figured that Colosimo was waiting for someone and the killer knew it. If they could figure out who the killer was waiting for, they might be able to crack the case. Indy promised to talk to the waiter who chased the customer away. Ernie continued his digging in the Tribune's morgue. He also writes The New York Times for information.
</p><p>Sidney told Indy that Torrio would be taking over the restaurant and other business interests. He also said that Colosimo was waiting for a shipment of bootleg liquor. Later, Indy, Ernie and Eliot met. They decided to go to the restaurant and find out who sold Colosimo the liquor. Indy sneaked in and found the bootleg was packed in boxes marked "Cristo Lemonade Company." They traced this to a warehouse along the Lake Michigan waterfront. They went to the warehouse and broke into office. Unfortunately, they were discovered before they could find anything. The boys made a mad dash out and almost escaped, but were cornered when their car ran out of gas.
</p><p>The three were taken to see <a href="/index.php?title=O%27Bannon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="O'Bannon (page does not exist)">O'Bannon</a>, head of the Irish mob in Chicago and owner of the warehouse. He told them that he didn't have Colosimo killed, but wondered if someone was setting him up. He then let them go. That night at work, Torrio was gladhandling the customers, including the mayor. Indy spotted Al Brown wearing one of Colosimo's rings. He met with Eliot and Ernie and passed on what he saw. Ernie's information had arrived from The Times. It included the fact that Al Brown was really a small time gangster named <a href="/index.php?title=Alfonse_Capone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Alfonse Capone (page does not exist)">Alfonse Capone</a>, who fled New York with a murder rap over his head. There was also a photo of Capone and Torrio together. Eliot revealed that he had grabbed some papers off of the warehouse's desk before they fled. One of them showed that it was Torrio that placed the order for the liquor. Torrio and Capone had to be the ones behind Colosimo's murder.
</p><p>The three took their findings to Garrity who destroyed the evidence and threw them out. He warned them to keep quiet about the whole affair. Garrity was obviously on the take. Ernie decided to go to Paris to write, while Indy quit his job. Later at The Four Deuces, Indy was still brooding about how things worked out. Sidney decided that Indy was now ready to play the blues.

<p>In June, Indy was leaving Chicago for a summer job that Sidney Bechet was arranging for him in New York City. On the train, he sat next to a beautiful young woman who didn't seem to like or trust him very much. However, after a misunderstanding over an apple that Indy dropped, they started to get along.

Gershwin was impressed with Indy's playing and they went to get something to eat.
</p><p>Later, while shooting pool with some of George's composer friends <a href="/index.php?title=George_White&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="George White (page does not exist)">George White</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Irving_Berlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Irving Berlin (page does not exist)">Irving Berlin</a>, Indy told him about Peggy. Gershwin and the others told Indy about love and music. He also told Indy to go to the Globe Theater and asked a man named Mac about a job. When Indy got back to Kate's they talked for a bit and wound up kissing.
The next morning Indy went to the theater and landed a job as the assistant to the stage manager, Mac. The theater was deep in rehearsals for its show Scandals of 1920 which its star and director, George White, hoped would blow away Ziegfeld's Follies. To that end, he had hired away Ziegfeld's star <a href="/index.php?title=Anne_Pennington&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Anne Pennington (page does not exist)">Anne Pennington</a>. However, his assistant, Schwartz was worried about the expenses the show was incurring, but White didn't want to be bothered. George was writing the music for the show. During a break, Indy told George about Kate. Gershwin invited Indy and Kate to a party on Fifth Avenue. Back at Kate's she declined the invitation as she was going to a poetry reading. She told Indy to go ahead without her.
</p><p>George and Indy arrived at the party and Indy was swept away by the splendor of the penthouse and the beauty of <a href="/index.php?title=Gloria_Schuyler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gloria Schuyler (page does not exist)">Gloria Schuyler</a>, daughter of the host. He followed her out to the balcony as the band began to play a tango. She and Indy danced and she was swept off her feet. She finally took him home in a limousine at dawn. They made plans to see each other that night. Indy rushed into Kate's with only an hour before he had to be at work. Kate was just getting up and they made plans to have lunch at the Hotel Algonquin at one o'clock.
</p><p>That morning at work, White was driving the chorus girls hard. Anne Pennington arrived to rehearse her number which Gershwin wrote. He complained that she was taking it too fast, but she didn't like the song anyway. White told him to write her another song. Later Gershwin asked Indy about how things went with Gloria and ribbed him about having two girls. Gloria then arrived to take him out to lunch. Afterwards, he got her to drop him off at the Algonquin under the pretext of having to run an errand for White. He also made plans to meet her for a late dinner at ten o'clock.
Inside the hotel, Kate introduced Indy to some of her friends that they'd be joining for lunch. Among them were author <a href="/index.php?title=Dorothy_Parker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dorothy Parker (page does not exist)">Dorothy Parker</a> and critic <a href="/index.php?title=Alexander_Woollcott&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Alexander Woollcott (page does not exist)">Alexander Woollcott</a> Most of the rest are theater critics who had already taken a dim view of White's production. Indy didn't think it was fair that they had written their reviews already. That afternoon at the theater, auditions were being held for new chorus girls. One of them was Peggy, who tells Indy that she didn't make it. Indy talked to George who gets her hired. Happy, she told Indy that she was buying him dinner tonight after work at six.
</p><p>Indy then got a phone call from Kate who was looking forward to having dinner with him around eight. While he was on the phone, a box of candy arrives from Gloria with a note reminding him of their date for ten o'clock. George could only marvel at Indy's predicament, but offered no help. As Indy tried to leave work, Mac, who had been drinking, gave Indy more work to do. He wound up being late to meet Peggy. She treated him to chili dogs, which he quickly ate, saying he had to get back to the theater. He then raced to Kate's where she fed him a big pasta dinner. Then making the same excuses about work, he headed out to Gloria's. When he got there, she noticed that he was looking a bit run down and lectured him on the importance of eating three meals a day.
</p><p>The next day at work, things were not going well. The new girls were slow to learn the dance numbers and the show opened in just ten days. White still hadn't found a girl to sing the song Anne rejected. Indy talked to George about having Peggy audition for it. Meanwhile, Schwartz had bad news for White. The backers had pulled out of the show and they needed twenty thousand dollars or the show would fold before it opened. That evening Indy told what happened to Peggy, Kate and Gloria. Gloria placed a call to her father.
</p><p>The next day, Peggy was set to audition for the song when she was interrupted for an announcement. They had a new backer for the show, Gloria's father J.J. Schuyler. He had arrived to watch rehearsals with Gloria. He was impressed with Peggy's audition, so White gave her the number. Backstage, Indy was given a kiss by an excited Peggy, when Schuyler and Gloria showed up on a backstage tour with White. George saw Indy's predicament and pulled Peggy away before Gloria caught up to him.
</p><p>That night at Kate's, some friends were over for a poetry reading. She read them a poem about love that she wrote for a flattered Indy. He then left for dinner at Gloria's, where she gave him a watch. After dinner, he went to see Sidney with George and Peggy. While there, she gave him a monogrammed handkerchief. After practice the next day, Indy and George talked about his problem. Indy just couldn't decide what to do.
</p><p>A few days later, Indy joined Kate and her friends for lunch. They told him that Ziegfeld had threatened to pull his ads from their papers if they gave White's show good reviews. The critics promised not to let Ziegfeld blackmail them. During the meal, Indy spilled water on Kate. He pulled out Peggy's handkerchief to mop it up and she absently placed it in her purse.
</p><p>With less than a week to go before the show, things had reached a hectic pace at the theater. The show was running overtime, so Peggy's number was cut. Indy gave her Gloria's watch pin to help her get to practice on time. When he went to Kate's after work, Gloria called, insisting that he come right over. Making an excuse to Kate, he rushed right off. At the penthouse, Indy read her lines from Kate's poem. She loved it and promised to have it engraved on his cigarette case.
</p><p>A day before the show, Indy received a dozen roses from Gloria which he passed onto Peggy. White was driving everyone unmercifully. Indy was having trouble getting the stage's turntable to run smoothly and it was vital to the show's first act finale. George and Indy relaxed after practice talking about the fate of the show. Indy remembered that it was his twenty-first birthday.
</p><p>On opening night the backstage area was chaos. Kate arrived and told Indy that she had to review the show as the paper's regular critic was sick. Gloria and Mr. Schuyler showed up to wish Indy luck with only a few minutes until the curtain went up, the first emergency popped up. Mac was passed out drunk, courtesy of a bottle of booze sent by Ziegfeld. Indy would have to run the show. The next emergency cropped up moments later. Someone had stolen the costumes for the first number. Indy quickly improvised giant fans out of some costume feathers. The opening number went on, shocking some of the audience and impressing the critics.

<p>The next number feathered Anne, but her dressing room door was jammed shut. Indy quickly battered it down and carried her bodily to the stage. Meanwhile, Bonzo, the monkey in an animal act that was part of the show, was running amuck in the rafters. As Indy tried to catch him, he inadvertently sent pillars crashing down onto the stage. The rest of the first act went well until the finale. The stage's turntable was broken beyond repair. George got an idea. He had Peggy sing the song he wrote exactly at the slow pace they practiced it at. What White had tried to make a jazzy ragtime number, Peggy sang as a slow love ballad and brought the house down.
</p><p>After the show, Peggy, Gloria and Kate were all at the cast party, but George helped Indy put by keeping them distracted. The early editions of the papers arrived and the reviews were fantastic, with special notice of Peggy's singing. Despite George and Indy's jockeying, Kate, Gloria and Peggy ended up in the powder room at the same time. There, Kate noticed a few lines of her poem inscribed on Gloria's cigarette case. Gloria noticed her watch pin pined to Peggy. Peggy noticed her handkerchief in Kate's hand. Back at the party, a birthday cake was wheeled out for Indy. As he blew out the candles, the three women entered. Indy tried to explain, but they simply pushed his face into the cake.

<p>By August, Indy was stuck in New York after being fired from his job at the theater with a month of summer vacation left, no job and not enough money for next year's tuition.

Indy was hired by <a href="/index.php?title=Carl_Laemmle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Carl Laemmle (page does not exist)">Carl Laemmle</a> to go to Hollywood to force director (and star actor) <a href="/wiki/Erich_von_Stroheim" title="Erich von Stroheim">Erich von Stroheim</a> to complete his movie Foolish Wives within ten days or close down the filming which had gone outrageously over budget.

<p>Indy was introduced to <a href="/index.php?title=Claire_Lieberman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Claire Lieberman (page does not exist)">Claire Lieberman</a>, one of the writers of the movie. She explained to Indy how von Stroheim kept adding scenes to the movie without any end in sight. When Indy told her that many of the planned scenes would have to be cut she gave Indy a copy of the script to read before he "made any more stupid suggestions."
At breakfast with Claire and Irving, Indy tried to decide what to cut. Irving introduced Indy to director <a href="/index.php?title=John_Ford&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John Ford (page does not exist)">John Ford</a>. Ford told Indy to forget the script and view the film that had already been shot in order to decide what to cut. After watching the prints, Indy and Claire went to the beach to look at the night sky. Claire told him how currently the director was the "king" of the movie, while Bernstein wanted to shift that power to the producer. In the course of their conversation, a romance began to bud, but Claire told Indy that she had a boyfriend. In the middle of kissing Claire came up with a way to end the movie.
</p><p>The next day, Claire found out that she was fired from Foolish Wives. To further complicate matters, Indy found out that Stroheim had taken all of the prints for the movie to his house. Indy went there to get them back and, over watching von Stroheim drink ox blood, von Stroheim told him that he did not take the film. Irving later told Indy that they had the negative and could strike another print from it. They decided that in order to end the movie, they needed to film a scene where von Stroheim's character died.
</p><p>While driving, Claire told Indy that she loved him, but she also still loved her boyfriend <a href="/index.php?title=Tony&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tony (page does not exist)">Tony</a>. Indy was informed the next day that he couldn't get the scenes shot that he needed to end the film because <a href="/index.php?title=Prince_Massimo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Prince Massimo (page does not exist)">Prince Massimo</a>, the Italian prince actor, was arriving to film other scenes. Indy decided to stop Massimo from showing up by kidnapping him and dumping him in Mexico. Indy, Irving and Claire went to a party being thrown by <a href="/index.php?title=Douglas_Fairbanks&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Douglas Fairbanks (page does not exist)">Douglas Fairbanks</a> and <a href="/index.php?title=Mary_Pickford&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mary Pickford (page does not exist)">Mary Pickford</a> to snatch the Prince.

</p><p>The following day, von Stroheim exploded in a rage when he found out that Massimo had not showed. He began thinking up new scenes in order to avoid filming his death scene and rehired Claire to write the scenes for him. After filming the new scene, Indy declared that he'd think of something even if he had to kill von Stroheim himself. During the duel scene being filmed the next day, Indy rolled marbles under von Stroheim's feet so it would look like he'd been shot and they'd have their death scene with which that could finish the movie.
</p><p>Unfortunately, all of the extras fell over while von Stroheim remained standing. At lunch, Ford told Indy, Irving and Claire they needed to slip von Stroheim a "mickey" to get him to fall over and slipped a horse tranquilizer pill into von Stroheim's drink. On the set, von Stroheim could barely stay awake as he tried once again filming the duel scene. Von Stroheim ended up dramatically stumbling and falling after he was "shot" and Indy got the scene on film he needed to end the movie on the tenth and last day he was allotted.
</p><p>Indy went to von Stroheim and congratulated him on the finish of the film, but von Stroheim congratulated Indy on beating him. Von Stroheim gave Indy tickets to a gala movie premiere with which he could take Claire and Irving. While they were there von Stroheim took the whole production crew to Mexico to continue filming the movie. Indy received a telegram from Laemle telling him that he'd been fired without his bonus. Irving also received a telegram from Laemle, however, his told him that he'd been made head of Universal Pictures and his first assignment was to go to Mexico and take control of von Stroheim.

<p>Finding himself stuck in Hollywood with no money and no job, Indy took a job with John Ford as his assistant on his next western movie Six Steps to Hell. Ford told Indy how his real name was Sean Allouicious O'Feeney and that his brother Francis Ford was the first to rename himself when he first came to America. Ford introduced Indy to <a href="/index.php?title=Harry_Carey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Harry Carey (page does not exist)">Harry Carey</a>, the star actor and Indy took notes as Ford and Carey rewrote the bad script they were given.

Wyatt Earp told Indy, Ford and Carey about real gunfights as opposed to the fictional stories. After finishing typing the new script that Ford and Carey wrote, Indy went to see Claire. Claire once again told Indy that she still had feelings for Tony, but Claire decided that if things worked out between her and Indy over the next two weeks she'd break up with Tony. The next day, however, Indy found out that they'd be filming on location for the entire time and he wouldn't be able to see Claire. Indy went to tell Claire before he headed out and he found her with Tony.
</p><p>The whole crew headed out and en route stops to film the final scene first in front of the setting sun. At night, Wyatt Earp told stories of the old west to the crew as Indy tried writing a letter to Claire. Indy ended up getting advice from the crew about what to do with Claire. The general consensus was that he should get over her because she was not going to leave Tony.

<p>While filming the next day a small earthquake hitted and a fire started in the house they were shooting a scene in. Ford continued to film and began improvising a new scene working the burning building into it. Filming continued without any problems over the next few days until one of the lead actors was killed in his sleep by a poisonous snake. Ford had Indy take over the deceased actor's role, however, Indy's lack of acting ability soon became evident. Indy improved over the next few days of filming, however, Ford found himself a day behind schedule and without any stuntmen after they are all injured on the set. Claire arrived to visit Indy after getting his letter. On the last day of filming, Ford had Indy act as a stuntman to complete the final scene to filmed - the runaway coach scene. Indy agreed to do it for extra pay and risked his life as he jumped from his horse to the wagon, missed and ended up underneath the wagon, being dragged on his back, pulling himself to the front where he grabbed hold of the reins and stopped the horses from going over a cliff. With the movie done, Indy said his farewell to Claire and everyone else and returned to the University of Chicago with a broken leg and enough money for tuition.

<p>In March 1933, Indy and his guide, <a href="/index.php?title=Bernabe&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bernabe (page does not exist)">Bernabe</a>, discovered a <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Skull_of_Cozan" title="Crystal Skull of Cozan">Crystal Skull</a> in the lost city of Cozan, British Honduras.

The tomb of Emperor <a href="/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang" title="Qin Shi Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a>, China's first Emperor, had been found and it could not be accessed without the complete Mirror of Dreams.

A superstitious Chinese populace had postponed the excavation of the tomb, but the pearl still had to be recovered before it fell in the wrong hands, for the Nazis were also after the pearl. A special artifact had to be found before you could enter the tomb, but, alas, it was in three parts. One of those parts was found in Ceylon.
</p><p>Indy traveled to a 15th century alchemist's castle in Prague, and a Nazi excavation of the fabled palace of Belisarius in Istanbul.

<p>Jones and Wu Han traveled to the Peng Lai Mountains in the South China Sea, where Kai's fortress was located. There Indy came across a temple where he found an ancient Chinese weapon that Mei Ying said that he would need within the tomb. Mei Ying was rescued while Kai combined all three pieces of the artifact. Indy took the artifact and he, Mei Ying and Wu Han opened the emperor's tomb. Inside they found many cunning traps. Marshal Kai and the Black Dragon Triad caught up with the group and they fought within the tomb. Von Beck, realizing that he had been double crossed, entered the tomb himself where he met his demise. Indiana Jones located the emperor's crypt and took the pearl, however the power of the artifact was too much for Indy to handle and it overwhelmed him. Indy dropped the pearl and it rolled right to Kai, who had been conditioned and could handle the power, retrieved it. Indy defeated Kai with the <a href="/wiki/Pa_Cheng" title="Pa Cheng">Pa Cheng</a>, and the Heart of the Dragon rolled harmlessly into the abyss.

Indy caught the boy with his whip, and instead of punishing him, took him under his wing. Jones introduced the boy to American baseball, especially the New York Yankees, and taught him several other useful things, such as driving.

<p>Indy went to Lao Che’s nightclub <a href="/wiki/Club_Obi_Wan" title="Club Obi Wan">Club Obi Wan</a> to meet up with the gangster. After an impressive performance of “Anything Goes” in Mandarin by the American singer <a href="/wiki/Willie_Scott" title="Willie Scott">Willie Scott</a>, Jones sat down with Lao Che and his sons to discuss the deal. Indy delivered the urn containing the ashes, and demanded the diamond in return. Lao Che gave him the Peacock’s Eye, but started laughing diabolically as Indy drank from his glass of champagne. Lao Che demanded the diamond back, and in exchange he would give Indy antidote to the poison he just drank. Indy, realizing it was a matter of life and death, threatened Willie Scott with a knife and tried to bargain with her life. Lao Che was not concerned about his lover’s life. Suddenly the waiter, <a href="/wiki/Wu_Han" title="Wu Han">Wu Han</a> in disguise, pointed a gun at Lao Che. As a champagne cork popped Chen shot Han with a hidden gun. Indy turned to his friend Wu Han, who died in his arms. Indy, weakened from the poison, hurled a skewered pigeon-flambé into Chen’s chest to avenge. As panic broke out, Indy tried to catch the antidote, but it was thrown out on the floor, as was the diamond. Indy tried desperately to catch the antidote as Kao Kan and his mobsters tried to shoot him down with automatic weapons. Indy hid behind a giant gong, as Willie found the antidote. Indy took her hand, and together they leaped out of the window, and fell down in a car – driven by Short Round. As Indy drank the antidote, Short Round drove the three to the airport, where Indy’s contact <a href="/wiki/Earl_Weber" title="Earl Weber">Earl Weber</a> had managed to secure them seats on an airplane. Indy failed to notice that the plane in fact belonged to Lao Che.

<p>Airborne somewhere above <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, Willie had realized that the pilots had abandoned the plane, and woke Indy up. Indy tried to fly the plane, but the engines died, and they had to jump out of the plane on a lifeboat. As they fell to the ground, the lifeboat swept over the snowy mountainside, past a vast waterfall, and finally down to the lower ground. There, Indy caught sight of an old man following them next to the river, and then declared that they were in India.

<p>Indy, Willie and Shorty followed the old man to the village of Mayapore. The village crops and wells were totally dry, and no children were present. The old man, a shaman, and the village leader told Indy that they would supply them with a guide to take them to <a href="/index.php?title=Delhi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Delhi (page does not exist)">Delhi</a> – but they would have to make a stop on the way – <a href="/wiki/Pankot_Palace" title="Pankot Palace">Pankot Palace</a>. Indy pointed out that Pankot was not on the way to Delhi, and the village elders explained how evil was again present at Pankot, which had once been the center for the <a href="/wiki/Thuggee" title="Thuggee">Thuggee</a>-clan who had worshiped their goddess <a href="/wiki/Kali" title="Kali">Kali</a> with human sacrifices. The elders explained that the village had been in possession of one of the so called <a href="/wiki/Sankara_Stones" title="Sankara Stones">Sankara Stones</a>. The Thuggees had kidnapped the village’s children and taken the holy stone, which had granted the village its fertility.
</p><p>Indy, Willie and Shorty sat off to Pankot, riding on elephants. On the way Indy caught Shorty cheating while they were playing poker, at the same time Willie encountered several wild animals which brought her to a state of panic. Finally closing in to the enormous palace, Indy and the Indian guides found an ancient statue of Kali. The statue was covered with fresh blood. The horrified guides rode back. Indy, Willie and Shorty walked to the palace, where they were greeted by the Pankot Prime Minister, <a href="/wiki/Chattar_Lal" title="Chattar Lal">Chattar Lal</a>.
</p><p>Indy, Willie, and Shorty later attended a dinner in honor of the local Maharadjah, a boy not much older than Shorty. As Willie was terrified with the primitive dishes they were offered, Indy discussed with <a href="/wiki/Captain_Blumburtt" title="Captain Blumburtt" class="mw-redirect">Captain Blumburtt</a> of the English Army. Blumburtt briefed Indy on the history of the Thuggees, who were thought to have been wiped out by the British a hundred years earlier. Indy told Chattar Lal the story the village elders had told him; and that they said that the Thuggees were active once again. Lal was insulted, and the Maharadjah, having overheard the conversation, said that he was ashamed of the Thuggees, and assured that he would not allow them to flourish in his kingdom.
</p><p>Later Indy and Willie flirted with each other, but none of them could admit their attraction for the other, so it all ended in an argument. Indy returned to his room, where he was attacked by an Indian thug. Shorty threw Indy his whip, and the thug was strangled when the whip was caught in the mechanical fan. Indy ran to Willie’s room to find her unharmed. There he discovered a secret passageway leading to an underground tunnel. Indy and Shorty entered, and found themselves in the middle of thousands and thousands of different insects in various sizes. They were then trapped in a room in which the roof was filled with razor-sharp spikes. Shorty unwillingly happened to start a mechanism that made the roof move downwards. At the last second Willie, who almost was scared to death by all the insects, was able to pull a break which stopped the moving roof. The three then continued through the tunnel, which eventually lead them to a vast underground temple. There they witnessed the Thuggee-cult during one of their rituals. The high priest, <a href="/wiki/Mola_Ram" title="Mola Ram">Mola Ram</a>, using black magic, removed the heart from the victim, and then lowered him down to his death on a river of molting lava.
</p><p>As the Thuggees vanished, Indy went down to the altar to collect the Sankara Stones. However, Willie and Shorty were captured by some thugs, and Jones was also caught. As Jones and Shorty were tied up, Mola Ram told them of his plan to take over the world – using the power of the sacred stones. Mola Ram forcibly fed Indy with infected blood, which then made Indy fall into what was called “the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sleep_of_the_Kali_Ma" title="Black Sleep of the Kali Ma">black sleep of Kali Ma</a>”.
</p><p>When Indy awoke, he had become a shadow of his former self, now completely under the spell of Kali. Mola Ram let Indy prove his dedication to Kali by personally supervising the sacrifice of Willie. Willie tried to bring Indy back to his former self, but to no avail. The Thuggees started to lower Willie down, as Shorty, in frustration, burned Indy with the fire from a torch. The fire brought Indy back to his senses, and together with Shorty, he fought off the surrounding Thuggees and was able to take the stones. Indy managed to bring Willie back to the surface before she was killed by the flames throwing from the lavabed. Willie, thinking Indy was still under the spell, hit him. Indy assured her that he was himself again.

<p>Now, Indy was determined to finish what he came there to do. He confronted the Thuggees who were forcing the children to continue the tunnel digging in search of the final Sankara stones. Together with Willie and Shorty, he freed the children, who, in turn, helped the three to overthrow the slavers. Indy was caught in a fight with a giant thug. The Maharajah, who was also under the spell, was holding a voodoo-doll of Indy in his hands, and stabbed it with a knife. Indy was struck with severe pain, and the thug got the upper hand in their fight. Shorty managed to beat the Maharadjah, and pulled the knife out of the doll. He also was able to free the Maharadjah from his spell using a torch. Indy beat the thug, who was crushed to death at the end of a conveyor belt.
</p><p>The trio then tried to escape on a mine car, but they were followed by thuggees. Through skill and a large amount of luck, the followers where lost, and Indy was able to stop the mine car with his feet, after the break had broken down. However, Mola Ram had released an enormous bowl of water, which forced Indy, Willie and Shorty to take cover on the other side of the tunnel, which happened to be on the edge of a cliff on the side of a deep ravine.

<p>Willie and Shorty started to cross the ravine on a crudely-built tree-bridge, as Indy fought off a band of Thuggees. On the bridge, they soon found themselves surrounded by more Thuggees. Mola Ram demanded the stones. Indy realized that he only had one option, and used his newly acquired sword to cut through the bridge. Indy, Willie and Shorty held on to one half of the bridge as it fell to the wall of the cliff. As they tried to climb up, Mola Ram confronted Indy, and tried to use his magic to pull the latter’s heart out. Indy started chanting in the Indian language, and by his words, the Shankara stones started to glow. They fell through the bag they were contained in, and as Mola Ram caught one of them it burned his hand. Indy then caught it as it had cooled down, and declared to Ram that he had betrayed Shiva. Mola Ram fell into the river, and was eaten alive by crocodiles. Captain Blumburtt and his band of 11th Poona Rifles arrived in time to shoot down the remaining Thuggees. Indy climbed up the cliff and was met by the relieving smiles of Willie and Shorty. In his hand he held the stone.
</p><p>Indy, Willie and Shorty returned to the Indian village together with the lost children. The crops had started to flourish once again. The children were reunited with their parents, and Indy returned the stone to the village elders. Willie suggested Indy keeping it, but he decided against it. Willie told Indy she wouldn’t follow him on any more adventures, but he caught her with his whip, and they kissed.

As Tibetan bandits attacked, the three escaped on <a href="/wiki/Jock_Lindsey" title="Jock Lindsey">Jock Lindsey</a>'s <a href="/wiki/OB1" title="OB1">plane</a> to <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. The junior Beresford-Hope gave them his father's piece, which contained a map pointing to the tomb's location in <a href="/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>.
</p><p>Brody tried to convince Jones to give up the search, because the secrets locked behind this key were beyond human history. Jones disagreed, and set off with Beresford-Hope on a freighter bound for the Arctic Ocean to find the knowledge of the Tomb of the Gods. After stopping in <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, Jones and Beresford-Hope were captured by von Hassell and Le Roi, now working for the Nazis. With all three pieces of the key in his possession, von Hassell threw Jones in a shot-up rowboat, betrayed Le Roi by cutting her arm and tossing her in with Jones and set them adrift without oars. 
</p><p>Jones tied off Le Roi's wound, but <a href="/wiki/Shark" title="Shark">sharks</a> were already drawn to their wreck. Trying to create a signal, Jones created a small fire using his and Le Roi's shirts. Before they could be finished off by sharks, they were rescued by Brody on a whaling ship. Aboard the ship, Jones locked up Le Roi, not willing to trust her. Reaching the coast of Siberia, Jones released her when she revealed that she had hidden a map copied off of the two pieces that von Hassell had first gained. Combined with a copy of the map that Jones had from the Beresford-Hope piece, Jones, Brody, and Le Roi set out on dogsled to catch up with von Hassell. Taking a shortcut across an ice bridge, they caught up with von Hassell's sledges, and Jones tried to rescue Beresford-Hope. A lightning strike caused the ice to open, and both teams fell into the chasm.

<p>Jones slid into an underground passageway and was found by Le Roi, who showed him that Brody was now a captive of the <a href="/wiki/Ahnenerbe" title="Ahnenerbe">Ahnenerbe</a> group. Jones and Le Roi secretly followed von Hassell and his men into the giant <a href="/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Gods" title="Tomb of the Gods">Tomb of the Gods</a>. When von Hassell ordered Beresford-Hope to open the Tomb's doors or face death, Jones guessed that the younger man would give into his own curiosity, and was shocked when Beresford-Hope refused, and then was quickly cut down by von Hassell's blade. When several members of the Ahnenerbe group came under possession of the voices in the chamber and opened fire on the rest of their colleagues, Jones swung into the scene to save Brody, kicking down a <a href="/wiki/Blond_Ahnenerbe_Agent" title="Blond Ahnenerbe Agent">blond gunman</a>, and punching out a <a href="/wiki/Bald_Ahnenerbe_Agent" title="Bald Ahnenerbe Agent">bald attacker</a>, before trying to help Brody up with his satchel of dynamite. The pair were saved from a <a href="/wiki/Goatee_Ahnenerbe_Agent" title="Goatee Ahnenerbe Agent">third gunman</a> by Le Roi. Von Hassell used the key to open the massive doors, and entered the vault. Taking Brody's dynamite, Jones followed him inside. Von Hassell cut at Jones, and tried to get him to admit that they were both in this quest for the new knowledge. Jones agreed, but sought vengeance for Beresford-Hope's death, and to prevent the Nazis from getting the secrets, and dropped von Hassell into the pit, and ignited the dynamite and threw it in the pit as well. Running from the vault, Jones gathered up Brody and Le Roi and fled from the tomb before it collapsed from the explosion. Resting for a second, Jones was congratulated on his actions by Brody, and was held closely by Le Roi, who was a little disappointed in the lack of treasure.

<p>Only a short time later, several golden <a href="/wiki/Chachapoyan" title="Chachapoyan">Chachapoyan</a> figurines began to surface at the antiquities market. This made Jones suspicious. All evidence pointed to a rival archeologist from <a href="/wiki/Princeton" title="Princeton">Princeton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forrestal" title="Forrestal">Forrestal</a>. Indy had recently acquired a part of an ancient map detailing the route to the Indian temple, and so he travelled to <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a> and started searching the jungles together with some of his South American contacts. Another part of the map was in the hands of the unreliable Peruvian guides <a href="/wiki/Satipo" title="Satipo">Satipo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barranca" title="Barranca">Barranca</a>. Fully aware of that they couldn't be trusted, Indy made a deal with them anyway, as he needed their portion of the map.
</p><p>As Indy and his guides came closer to the temple, Barranca made a foolish attempt to kill him. Jones disarmed the bandit with the help of his whip. Indy then found the temple together with Satipo. When they entered the ancient building, they soon realized that the Chachapoyan Indians had designed several lethal traps that one had to get through in order to find the treasure. For instance the entrance was filled with giant tarantulas.
Soon Indy also discovered how Forrestal met his end, when a bed of wooden spikes shoot out from the tunnel with the remains of the rival archeologist on it.

<p>Several traps later, Indy finally reached the room where the <a href="/wiki/Chachapoyan_Fertility_Idol" title="Chachapoyan Fertility Idol">Chachapoyan Fertility Idol</a> stood waiting. The disk that held the Idol was pressure-sensitive, and therefore Indy tried to replace the artifact with a bag of sand. However, he realized all too late, that his estimate was wrong when the idol's pedestal sank into its table, and the temple walls started to collapse. Indy eluded poison darts that shot from the walls as Satipo used the bullwhip to swing to the other side of the chasm. Satipo held the whip and demanded that Indy toss him the idol in exchange. Indy passed Satipo the idol, but the guide doublecrossed him and droppred the whip out of the archaeologist's reach. With great difficulty, Jones jumped to the other side of the chasm and make it under a stone slab before it slammed shut. He then found Satipo impaled on the same spikes that killed Forrestal. Seconds later, Indy found himself running from an enormous boulder which had fallen from the ceiling. 
</p><p>Indy came out of the temple alive, only to find himself surrounded by a group of armed Hovitos, under the influence of <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Emile_Belloq" title="René Emile Belloq">René Belloq</a>. Belloq took the Idol from Jones, but as he turned and showed the warriors the treasure, they fell to their knees, Indy took the oppotunity to escape. The Hovitos pursued Indy, but he was able to make it to the shore of a river where his pilot <a href="/wiki/Jock_Lindsey" title="Jock Lindsey">Jock Lindsey</a>, was waiting to fly them away to safety.

<p>Jones returned to <a href="/wiki/Marshall_College" title="Marshall College">Marshall College</a>, and after <a href="/wiki/Archaeology_101" title="Archaeology 101">a lecture</a> he told <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Brody" title="Marcus Brody">Marcus Brody</a> that he failed to recover the Idol. Brody, however, told Indy that a couple of Army Intelligence men where waiting for him. When Indy went to see them, they told him that they recently had intercepted a secret Nazi message sent from <a href="/wiki/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> to <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>. The message said that a dig at <a href="/wiki/Tanis" title="Tanis">Tanis</a> was proceeding, and that something called the <a href="/wiki/Headpiece_to_the_Staff_of_Ra" title="Headpiece to the Staff of Ra">Headpiece to the Staff of Ra</a> had to be found. It also mentioned the name of <a href="/wiki/Abner_Ravenwood" title="Abner Ravenwood">Abner Ravenwood</a>, Indy's former mentor. The Intelligence officers, <a href="/wiki/Eaton" title="Eaton">Eaton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Musgrove" title="Musgrove">Musgrove</a>, wondered if Indy could tell them what the message was all about. Indy and Brody told them about Prof. Ravenwood and his obsession with the city of Tanis and the Staff of Ra, and how those to elements were tied together with the legend of the <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a> - the golden chest in which <a href="/wiki/Moses" title="Moses">Moses</a> and the Hebrews kept the stone tablets containing the 10 Commandments that were given from God. In theory, the Headpiece was to be placed on a staff (with an unknown height) that when placed in a place called the <a href="/wiki/Well_of_the_Souls" title="Well of the Souls">Well of the Souls</a> would pin-point the exact location of the Ark. Indy was assigned by the American Secret Service to find the Ark before the Nazis did. Indy looked through Prof. Ravenwood's old journal, which he still had in his possession. The last entry mentioned the country of <a href="/wiki/Nepal" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> as a possible location of clues to the whereabouts of the Ark. Indy decided to travel to Nepal to look for his old mentor.

<p>In Nepal Indy met up with his old friend, <a href="/wiki/Lin-Su" title="Lin-Su">Lin-Su</a>, who told him that Ravenwood was last seen in the region around <a href="/wiki/Patan" title="Patan">Patan</a>. Lin-Su loaned Indy his car. Indy found a pub in the mountain village of Patan called "<a href="/wiki/The_Raven" title="The Raven">The Raven</a>", but Abner was nowhere to be found. Instead Indy reunited with his former girlfriend <a href="/wiki/Marion" title="Marion" class="mw-redirect">Marion</a> (Abner's daughter). Marion seemed to be both pleased and disturbed by his return, as he had romanced her when she was, in her own words, "just a child". Indy asked if she knew where the Headpiece to the Staff of Ra was located. Marion told Indy to come back the next day, and as he left another interested party arrived - the Gestapo agent <a href="/wiki/Toht" title="Toht" class="mw-redirect">Toht</a> and his thugs. When Toht tried to hurt Marion in order to have her tell him about the Headpiece, Indy suddenly came back. With the help of Marion, and quite a large amount of luck, Indy killed the thugs. As the bar was burning down to the ground, Toht spotted the Headpiece, but it was so hot due to the fire, that it burned his hand, and he panicked out in the snow. Marion, having lost her bar, gave Indy the Headpiece, and declared that she was going to be his partner for the rest of the journey.
</p><p>Indy and Marion travelled to Cairo, <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, where they stayed at the residence of Indy's old friend <a href="/wiki/Sallah" title="Sallah" class="mw-redirect">Sallah</a>. Sallah told Indy that Belloq was leading the Nazi-founded excavation looking for the Ark. Indy told Sallah that Belloq wouldn't find the Ark without the Headpiece.
</p><p>In the streets of Cairo, Indy and Marion were ambushed by Egyptians employed by the Nazis. A long chase, which included Indy having to shoot an <a href="/wiki/Arab_Swordsman" title="Arab Swordsman">Arab Swordsman</a>, and had Marion hide in a basket, culminated when the basket was taken by Nazi agents, who seemed to put it in a truck. Indy fired at the truck, not knowing that it was full of explosives, which resulted in the fiery destruction of the truck. Indy mourned the apparent death of Marion, and confronted Belloq at a local bar. Belloq told Indy that they weren't too different, that archaeology was their religion.

<p>Later, Indy and Sallah visited the scholar <a href="/wiki/Imam" title="Imam">Imam</a>, who translated the inscriptions on the Headpiece. They soon came to realize that the Nazis only had a copy of one side of the Headpiece. The Nazis lacked the back side, which said that the staff had to be one kadam shorter than what the front side of the headpiece had said, in order to honor the hebrew God whose Ark it was.
</p><p>Indy and Sallah visited the dig site in the desert, and witnessed how the Nazis hadn't been able to find the Ark, as they were digging in the wrong place. Indy entered the <a href="/wiki/Map_Room" title="Map Room">Map Room</a>, where a miniature model of the city of Tanis could be found. He used his staff (with the right length) and, when the sun rose the sunbeam passed through the crystal in the headpiece, and made a beam of light which pointed at the spot where the Ark was buried.

<p>Indy stumbled into one of the Nazi-tents, and there he found Marion - alive, but captured. He decided that he should leave her there until later, so that his presence would not be exposed. At sundown Indy and Sallah's gang of diggers started to dig. When night came, they reached a structure of stone. They lifted the tablet, and under it they found the entrance to the Well of the Souls. Indy went down first, but to his horror he feel right in the middle of thousands of poisonous snakes. Eventually he located the Ark, and lifting it up with large wooden poles, Indy and Sallah brought it back to the surface. Indy didn't get the chance to come up again, however, until Belloq and his men spotted them. Sallah was captured, and Marion was thrown down to accompany Indy in the underground well. As the entrance was sealed, Indy and Marion had to fight their way through all of the snakes. At the same time they tried to find another way out. Indy used a large statue of Anubis to break the wall down, which made them find a way out.

<p>When they came out, they found that the Nazis where preparing to fly the Ark to Berlin in an <a href="/wiki/Flying_Wing" title="Flying Wing">advanced aircraft</a>. Indy's plan was to steal the craft, but he was spotted by some German mechanics. As Indy had to fight off an enormous German thug, Marion tried to get the plane started. Due to the leaking gasoline, the craft exploded. The Nazis were forced to transport the Ark to Cairo by truck. Indy rode after it on a white horse. A long and intense chase erupted, which eventually ended when Indy was able to take control of the truck that was holding the Ark, and thanks to Sallah's connections in Cairo, he got away.
</p><p>Indy and Marion sailed away with the Ark on the freighter <i><a href="/wiki/Bantu_Wind" title="Bantu Wind">Bantu Wind</a></i>, whose captain, <a href="/wiki/Simon_Katanga" title="Simon Katanga">Simon Katanga</a>, was a friend of Sallah's. It took not long however for the Nazis to locate them, and they took the Ark back, and kidnapped Marion. Indy was able to escape, and rode on the outside of the <a href="/wiki/Wurrfler" title="Wurrfler">German submarine</a>, which then took him to a military station, on an <a href="/wiki/Geheimhaven" title="Geheimhaven">island</a>, somewhere in the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. From there he followed the Nazis on their way to a secretly prepared outdoor altar where they planned to open the Ark. Indy tried to set Marion free by threatening to blow up the Ark with a bazooka, but Belloq called the bluff. Indy was captured.
</p><p>Jones and Ravenwood were bound to a pole close to the altar. As Belloq began his Jewish recitations, he opened up the Ark. He was gravely disappointed to find only sand inside of it. The sadistic Toht started laughing, but soon the silence was broken by an odd buzzing sound. Smoke and fog started to erupt from inside of the Ark, and soon what appeared to be heavenly spirits, or angels, rose and started floating above them. Jones told Ravenwood to keep her eyes shut. As Belloq's excitement grew, the angels suddenly changed appearance into what appeared to be ghoulish demons. The Nazis panicked and screamed in horror, as they were one by one killed and destroyed by lightning of fire coming from the Ark. The wrath of God had silenced those who had dared to look at the secrets of the Ark. The power of the Ark lifted all the bodies of the Nazis up into a storm that rose to the sky. Suddenly the storm diminished, and it was quiet again.
</p><p>Jones and Ravenwood returned to America. In <a href="/wiki/Washington_DC" title="Washington DC">Washington DC</a>, Brody and Jones met up with the Army Intelligence officials who paid them for their work and promised that the Ark would be researched by "top-men". Jones and Brody were disappointed, as they felt that the government agents didn't understand or respect the vast powers that the Ark beheld. Outside the government offices, a disillusioned Jones was met by Ravenwood, who offered him a drink.<sup id="cite_ref-raidersmovie_52-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-raidersmovie-52">[53]</a></sup>

<p>In <a href="/index.php?title=Buenos_Aires&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Buenos Aires (page does not exist)">Buenos Aires</a>, Jones was presented to Professor <a href="/wiki/Julio_Huertas" title="Julio Huertas">Julio Huertas</a>, an old friend of the Uribe family, who knew nothing of Felipe's present whereabouts. Continuing searching for clues, Jones and Francesca were told that Felipe had spent a lot of time studying the diary of <a href="/wiki/Vasco_de_la_Posco" title="Vasco de la Posco">Vasco de la Posco</a>. Breaking into the museum at night, the two found a hidden map inside the diary, pointing to the Peruvian border. Just when they were about to board a ship, they were attacked by a group of primitive natives called 'the soldiers of the sun', who demanded the map. Jones answered by swallowing it. In need of another kind of transport, the two professors were flown by aviator <a href="/wiki/Antoine_D%27Espere" title="Antoine D'Espere" class="mw-redirect">Antoine D'Espere</a>. Bad weather conditions forced Jones and Francesca to jump out of the plane with parachutes. Later they were found by locals, and taken to a temple, where they found Felipe, who revealed to Jones that he and Francesca had planned to kill him all along, in remembrance of their late father, who had told them that Indy had stolen the credit for discovering the <a href="/index.php?title=Pu-Abi_Harp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pu-Abi Harp (page does not exist)">Pu-Abi Harp</a> in <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> fifteen years earlier. Felipe also revealed his plans of claiming control over Peru with the help of his Neo-Incan empire, and using the arms of gold to destroy all threats against their power. Jones was left to be sacrificed on top of an Andes mountain, claiming that he never once had stolen a find from someone else.
</p><p>Using Hindi body-control, Indy managed to flee. Close to freezing to death, Jones saw a spectre guiding him to a baby llama, which in turn would lead him to a small village. Following the instructions on the map, Indy aquired the help of some locals, and started digging into the ground next to a large lake. Inside of a vast underground chamber, Jones found the Arms of Gold, but was then confronted by a group of men led by Major <a href="/index.php?title=Claude-Reed_Whitby&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Claude-Reed Whitby (page does not exist)">Claude-Reed Whitby</a> who were also searching for the treasure. A fight broke out between Whitby's men and the Incas. Felipe and Francesca arrived, with the latter having been drugged so as not be able to protest her brother's plans. The Incas began a ritual, which was suddenly interrupted by an earthquake. Felipe was killed, but Indy and Francesca managed to escape with their lives intact.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104">[105]</a></sup>
</p><p>In August, Jones recovered the <a href="/index.php?title=Shield_of_Perseus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Shield of Perseus (page does not exist)">shield</a> of <a href="/index.php?title=Perseus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Perseus (page does not exist)">Perseus</a> from an ancient sunken ship while diving off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a> in the presence of several news reporters.

<p>A few days later Indy returned to <a href="/wiki/Barnett_College" title="Barnett College">Barnett College</a>, where he delivered the cross to <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Brody" title="Marcus Brody">Marcus Brody</a>. After a lecture where Indy specifically told his students that a spot never were marked by an “X”, he was approached by several upset students who wanted their essays to be graded. Indy told his secretary <a href="/wiki/Irene" title="Irene">Irene</a> to make a list of of all the names, then he locked himself in his office, where in his mail, he found a package sent from <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>. He brought the package with him, and jumped out through the window. Outside he was approached by several threatening-looking men who asked him to step into their car.
</p><p>The men took Indy to a high class-party in a <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> hotel’s penthouse, where he was met by fellow historian <a href="/wiki/Walter_Donovan" title="Walter Donovan">Walter Donovan</a>, whom Indy knew fleetingly from his donations to the local museum. Donovan showed Indy the half of an ancient stone tablet with text mentioning the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Grail" title="Holy Grail">Holy Grail</a>, the chalice used by <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a> during the last supper. According to legend, one who drank from the Grail would be granted eternal life. The Grail was said to have been brought to a hidden location by two knights during the <a href="/index.php?title=Crusades&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Crusades (page does not exist)">Crusades</a>. Donovan also had in his possession a page of a manuscript written by a friar who chronicled the story of the knights. The text stated that two markers would lead the way to the Grail – and one of them was the stone tablet. As Donovan’s researcher recently had gone missing, he offered Indy the job to continue the search for the Grail. Indy told him to ask his <a href="/index.php?title=Father&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Father (page does not exist)">father</a>, the real expert, but Donovan revealed that Indy’s father was the man who had disappeared.
</p><p>Indy and Brody went to Indy's father's <a href="/wiki/25_Pine_Road" title="25 Pine Road">house</a> in Ferndale, and found it ransacked. Indy remembered the package from Venice, and opened it. Inside was his father's <a href="/wiki/Grail_diary" title="Grail diary" class="mw-redirect">Grail diary</a>; a collection of all the research he had ever done in the quest. Indy decided to take the job, and together with Brody he flew to Venice, where he was told to meet up with Donovan’s employee Dr. Schneider.

<p>In Venice, Indy and Brody met Dr. Schneider, who was in fact revealed to be a young woman with the first name <a href="/wiki/Elsa" title="Elsa">Elsa</a>. Elsa had been working with Henry until his sudden disappearance. The three went to an old church, now used as a library, which supposedly was the place where Henry was last seen. By finding clues in the wall paintings, Indy eventually realized that what they were looking for was a tomb – and that it was marked with an “X”. Indy and Elsa went down under the floor, and made their way through hundreds of rats, until they found the tomb of <a href="/wiki/Richard" title="Richard">Sir Richard</a>, one of the three knights. On top of Richard’s corpse Indy found the second stone tablet. Meanwhile Brody had been ambushed by a couple of fez-wearing men, who tried to burn Indy and Elsa alive. They managed to survive by hiding under the tomb, and then sat out after the ambushers on boat. Eventually, Indy confronted their apparent leader, who said that his name was <a href="/wiki/Kazim" title="Kazim">Kazim</a>, and that he was a member of the <a href="/wiki/Brotherhood_of_the_Cruciform_Sword" title="Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword">Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword</a> – whose mission was to protect the Grail from being found. Indy assured him that he wasn’t looking for the Grail, but for his father. Kazim told Indy that his father was being held at the <a href="/wiki/Castle_Brunwald" title="Castle Brunwald">Castle Brunwald</a> on the German/Austrian border. Before they journeyed there, Indy had time to romance Elsa. Indy also took a look at the diary pages Brody had been given. They detailed the way to the hiding place of the Grail – in the <a href="/wiki/Canyon_of_the_Crescent_Moon" title="Canyon of the Crescent Moon">Canyon of the Crescent Moon</a>. The only problem was that Henry had not known the name of the city from which to begin looking – but now Indy and Brody knew – <a href="/wiki/Alexandretta" title="Alexandretta" class="mw-redirect">Alexandretta</a>, now called <a href="/wiki/Iskenderun" title="Iskenderun">Iskenderun</a>.
</p><p>When they arrived at Castle Brunwald, Indy and Elsa tried to gather entrance by impersonating the Scottish lord Clarence McDonald and his assistant. The local butler was not convinced, but Indy beat him down. Indy and Elsa discovered that the Castle was a secret stronghold for Nazis. Indy used his whip to swing into the room where his father was held. Henry, thinking Indy was someone else, hit him in the head with a vase. Upon realizing that his son had come to save him, Henry was briefly overjoyed with meeting his son for the first time in almost twenty years. Soon, however, several Nazis arrived. Indy confused them by his bickering with Henry, and then suddenly shot them down with an MP40 machine gun. Indy and Henry were soon caught again. The Nazis had seemingly taken Elsa hostage, and used her as a bait in exchange for the diary. Henry told Indy that Elsa was in cahoots with the Nazis, but he didn’t believe him. Elsa then revealed that she was in fact a Nazi agent, and took the diary in her possession.

<p>Indy and Henry were tied up to a chair. Elsa realized that the diary was missing several pages, which had been given to Brody who had been sent to Iskenderun. Indy and his father were then left alone in the room. Henry managed to reach a lighter that Indy had brought with him, but burned his hand and in a reflex threw it to the floor, which then caught fire. The two had to move the chair away from the growing fire, and found themselves on the side of a moving wall. They were seen by Nazi agents who alerted their colleagues. Indy and Henry managed to escape, and found themselves on a motorbike. Followed by Nazis, Indy used his creativity to come up with ideas for how to get rid of them.
</p><p>After a heated argument Indy and Henry decided to go to <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> to recover the diary once again. They got the city as the Nazi Party was having a massive festival. Indy confronted Elsa and took the diary back. While trying to get back, he unwillingly stepped onto <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, who took the diary in his hands, not realizing its importance however, and signed it. Indy and Henry then boarded a flight on a zeppelin to <a href="/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>. They were discovered by the Allgemeine SS officer <a href="/wiki/Vogel" title="Vogel" class="mw-redirect">Vogel</a>, but escaped on the flight. On the way the zeppelin turned back, the crew having been informed of the identity of their travellers. Indy and Henry made their way off on a small airplane docked at the zeppelin.
</p><p>Indy was able to fly the plane good enough for them to flee, but as Nazi pilots chased after them, Henry mistakenly damaged the plane, and they were forced to land. As they still were pursued by a last plane, Henry thought up the idea to frighten off a flock of seagulls and making them fly onto the plane, thus making it lose control and crash. This made Indy look upon his father with a new kind of respect.
</p><p>Indy and Henry were met up with <a href="/wiki/Sallah" title="Sallah" class="mw-redirect">Sallah</a> in Iskenderun. Sallah told them that Brody had been kidnapped by the Nazis, which meant that they also had the map. The three travelled to the desert of the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Hatay" title="Republic of Hatay" class="mw-redirect">Republic of Hatay</a>, where they eventually caught up with the Nazis. Suddenly a fire-fight broke out. The Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword had arrived to tell the Nazis to keep out. However, they were all killed. Indy, Henry and Sallah made an attempt to save Brody and charged on the Nazi tanks on horseback. As Indy was busy fighting off the Nazi thugs, Henry sneaked into the tank where Brody was hidden, and tried to save him, but was also captured by Colonel Vogel. After several close encounters with death, Indy managed to free both Henry and Brody, but at the same time the tank went rolling towards a giant cliff. The tank fell over the cliff, and Indy threw himself off it at the last possible moment. Henry, Brody and Sallah thought, however, that he had perished. As they were standing above the cliff, mourning, Indy suddenly joined them. He was embraced by his father and they shared a brief moment of tenderness, before Henry told them to continue their mission.
</p><p>Indy and the others found the canyon with the help of the map, but discovered that Donovan and Schneider had already gotten there. They found a temple, carved into the mountain walls. Inside the Nazis had already tried to get past the three obstacles one had to pass in order to reach the Grail. The first of these tests was “the breath of God”. As Indy and the others were discovered, Donovan shot Henry in the stomach in order to force Indy to try and pass the tests. Indy had to recover the Grail if he was to save his father’s life.

<p>Indy stepped into the passage with the Grail diary in his hands. Henry had told him that only the penitent man would pass, which made Indy realize that as a penitent man he would have to kneel in front of god. As he kneeled, he barely kept his head from being cut off by giant razorblades. Indy grabbed a rope and hooked it on the blades, stopping them. The next test was “the word of God”. Indy entered a room where the floor was used as a checkerboard of cobblestones. He had to stand upon the write letters in order to pass. The word of God meant the name of God, and Indy instinctively stepped on the stone marked with a “J” (as in <a href="/index.php?title=Jehovah&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jehovah (page does not exist)">Jehovah</a>). The stone broke, and Indy almost fell to his death. He realized his fooliness; in Latin Jehovah started with an “I”. Indy passed the test, and stepped onto the third and last riddle – “the path of God”. The passageway then stopped, and Indy looked at what appeared to be an abyss – at the other side of it the passageway continued. No one could possibly jump that far. He remembered the invisible bridge from a painting in his father’s house. He had to believe if he was to save his father. As he took a step, he fell onto solid ground, but he could not see what he was standing on, but realized that there was in fact a bridge – only it had been painted to look like it wasn’t there. It was an invisible bridge, which one truly had to believe existed in order to pass.

<p>Indy stepped into the final room in which he saw an altar where hundreds of different grails were standing. In front of it an ancient-looking <a href="/index.php?title=Knight&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Knight (page does not exist)">knight</a> was sitting. The knight (the last of the brothers who swore to protect the Grail) tried to confront Indy, but was too weak, and fell on his back. The knight told Indy that he would now take his place, as he had vanquished him. At that moment Donovan and Schneider entered. The knight told them that they had to be careful – only the right Grail would bring life, the others would take it. Schneider picked a grail for Donovan – from which he drank, convinced that it indeed was the Cup of Christ. Donovan started to age rapidly, and all too late realized that he had picked the wrong one. He rotted in front of the others, and then turned to dust. Indy went to make his pick when his eyes fell on one that was different from the others – it was a simple cup, one that looked like it could have belonged to a carpenter. Indy drank from it, and the knight said that he had chosen wisely, however if the Grail was to be taken out of the temple – it would cost one’s immortality.
</p><p>Indy brought the Grail with him, and let his father drink from it. Henry was healed, and as they began to leave, Elsa grabbed the Grail and tried to run away with it. When she passed the giant seal, the temple walls started collapsing. As Elsa desperately tried to reach the Grail, she fell to her death. Indy then almost had the Grail in his grasp, but his father convinced him to let it go when he for the first time called him “Indiana”.
</p><p>Indy, Henry, Brody and Sallah left the temple, riding off into the sunset. Indy and Henry had found something more important than the Grail – they had found each other again.

<p>Also in 1938, Jones reunited with <a href="/wiki/Sophia_Hapgood" title="Sophia Hapgood">Sophia Hapgood</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Atlantis" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> buff who believed she had psychic premonitions, and sought the <a href="/wiki/Covenant_of_Buddha" title="Covenant of Buddha">Covenant of Buddha</a> across Asia.

With the help of Serpent Lady, Indy and the others escaped the city when the population realized Khamal was not their deity, only to be confronted by a warlord known as <a href="/wiki/Ch%27ao_the_Red" title="Ch'ao the Red">Ch'ao the Red</a>. Ch'ao made a grab for Sophie, but instead was stabbed by Khamal. When Ch'ao drew his sword on the boy, the warlord was shot dead by Jones. Afterward, Jones and Kali located the temple housing the Covenant, but were attacked by Kyojo.

<p>Indy and Sophia returned to Iceland where Doctor <a href="/wiki/Bjorn_Heimdall" title="Bjorn Heimdall">Bjorn Heimdall</a> directed them to two other scholars. In <a href="/wiki/Tikal" title="Tikal">Tikal</a>, Guatemala they met Doctor <a href="/wiki/Charles_Sternhart" title="Charles Sternhart">Charles Sternhart</a> who translated Plato's 'Hermocrates' into English. Inside the temple Sternhart took care of Indy's discovery of a tomb and a <a href="/index.php?title=Wordstone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Wordstone (page does not exist)">stone disk</a>, which Sternhart recognised as a 'Worldstone'.

</p><p>The document said that in order to gain access to Atlantis, three stone disks, the Sunstone, the Moonstone, and the Worldstone, were needed.

</p><p>Indy and Sophia went to Monte Carlo and tricked Trottier out of the Sunstone, before heading to Algiers, where they confronted Omar Al-Jabbar, a shopkeeper. Omar revealed that there was a dig by the Germans somewhere in the desert. Indy stole a touring balloon but the balloon was shot down by one of the Nazis who was guarding the dig. At the dig site they discovered a mural that gave Indy directions for Crete, the Palace of Knossos as an Atlantean colony.

<p>At the ruins of <a href="/index.php?title=Knossos&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Knossos (page does not exist)">Knossos</a>, using the hints from Hermocrates, Indy and Sophia dug out a hidden Moonstone.

There they found the body of Doctor Sternhart, who starved while unable to get out from a certain chamber. Indy and Sophia took the Worldstone from him. After a lot of searching they reached a map room containing a detailed model of Atlantis.
</p><p>Meanwhile, a Nazi submarine surfaced off the island and the Nazis entered the labyrinth. They kidnapped Sophia but Indy managed to get on the submarine and impersonate a crew member. He quietly freed Sophia and got the stolen disks back. Then he steered the ship towards an underwater entrance and dock, which was none other than the entrance to Atlantis itself. Sophia was then again kidnapped when they arrived to Atlantis.
</p><p>After a lot of exploring and machine repairing to rescue Sophia from a prison and enter Atlantis' second ring, Indy found out that Nur-Ab-Sal guided Sophia to Atlantis through the medallion, in order to reclaim his old kingdom. His ghost possessed Sophia completely. Indy took the opportunity to snatch the necklace and hurl it into a pool of lava in Nur-Ab-Sal's throne room.
</p><p>Indy and Sophia continued on to the heart of the city, a massive chamber full of lava with passageways leading up and down. The two managed to navigate the chamber to the city's centre. In the <a href="/index.php?title=Colossus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Colossus (page does not exist)">Colossus</a> - a huge machine in the centre of the capital, which gave the Atlanteans god-like powers, they were ambushed by Ubermann and Kerner. Kerner decided he was the most worthy one around to transform into a god. Based on Plato's tenfold error, Ubermann fed the machine with 1 bead instead of 10, which turned Kerner into a grotesque horned dwarf, who falls into the lava below. The Nazis then forced Indy to stand in the machine to be the target of the next experiment.

<p>Jones managed to convince Ubermann not to use him as the experiment, lest Ubermann and the Nazis became targets of a godly Indiana Jones' wrath. Rather, he appealed to Ubermann's anger and lust for power to let him be transformed by the machine instead. He fed the machine 100 beads and the machine turned him into a being of pure energy, who then exploded, activating the volcano that had been asleep for millennia. As the city was crumbling, Indy and Sophia made their way to the submarine and took it to the surface. The city collapsed deeper under the water, while Indy and Sophia watched the sun set on the smoke.<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114">[115]</a></sup>

Alone, Indy entered the tomb of <a href="/index.php?title=King_Atreus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="King Atreus (page does not exist)">King Atreus</a> to find an ancient knife, older than <a href="/index.php?title=Mycenae&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mycenae (page does not exist)">Mycenae</a> itself. Leaving the tomb, Jones found himself in the middle of a Nazi camp, taking one soldier hostage.

<p>The Nazi commander shot Jones' live shield dead, forcing Indy to flee on a bicycle. Jones was saved by a young woman named <a href="/wiki/Omphale_Kiapos" title="Omphale Kiapos">Omphale Kiapos</a>, who hid him inside a barrel containing olive-oil. While looking for a way to leave Greece, Jones was attacked by a group of hooded men speaking Turkish, who took the knife from him and on the way mentioned the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Fleece" title="Golden Fleece">Golden Fleece</a>. Omphale opened fire, and the thugs fled. Stealing an airplane from the Nazi camp, Jones and Omphale left Greece. The plane was damaged in an airbattle with a Nazi squadron, forcing them to land on top of the Mediterreanean next to the Dardanelles. Omphale managed to nurse the craft to health so that they could reach <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>.

</p><p>Looking into an old transcript of an auction twenty years earlier, which appeared to have had the ram of the fleece as one of its items for sale, they were assaulted by government people, but were able to escape, and found the name <a href="/wiki/Mehmed_Sarper" title="Mehmed Sarper">Mehmed Sarper</a> listed in the transcript. Sarper was revealed to still have the ram of the fleece in his possession, as no one had been interested in purchasing it. Jones and Daan found the fleece intact inside of the ram. Daan insisted it'd be kept in his possession, and drugged Jones and Omphale, so that he could escape with it. Waking up, Indy found Daan dead in his basement, killed by the cultmembers. Traveling east, to ancient <a href="/index.php?title=Colchis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Colchis (page does not exist)">Colchis</a>, Jones and Omphale walked right into a furious snowstorm, when Omphale started giving birth to her babyboy. At the same time the cult awoke the protector of the fleece, a giant snake. For reasons Indy could not explain, he lifted the baby up into the sky, and begged Hecate to honor it's innocence. Hecate struck the cultmembers down, and the serpent burned to death. The fleece was  transformed into a golden goat, which rejoined her in the skies.<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[119]</a></sup>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/1957" title="1957">1957</a>, Indy and George McHale were digging in some <a href="/wiki/Coastal_Mayan_ruins" title="Coastal Mayan ruins">ruins</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Yucat%C3%A1n" title="Yucatán" class="mw-redirect">Yucatán</a> when the two were captured by Russian soldiers, and brought to <a href="/wiki/Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> in the U.S. where the Russians infiltrated the secret military base <a href="/wiki/Hangar_51" title="Hangar 51">Hangar 51</a>. Indy and Mac were pulled out from the back of a car. Here they were confronted by the leader of the Russian band; <a href="/wiki/Irina_Spalko" title="Irina Spalko">Irina Spalko</a>. They were brought into a vast storage facility, and Spalko ordered Indy to locate the <a href="/wiki/Roswell_Remains" title="Roswell Remains" class="mw-redirect">remains</a> from the aircraft-wreckage which Indy inspected ten years prior. If Indy refused they would kill Mac. As Indy knew that the remains were highly magnetic, he told the Russian soldiers to empty their guns. The gunpowder then showed the way to the container. The soldiers opened the container, and Indy tried to escape his execution, but was betrayed by Mac, who was secretly working for the Russians. Despite the odds, he managed to escape, and on the way he briefly glimpsed the crate containing the <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>. After fighting his way through several Russian soldiers, among them the giant Colonel <a href="/wiki/Dovchenko" title="Dovchenko" class="mw-redirect">Dovchenko</a>, Indy fled from the military base on a <a href="/wiki/Rocket_sled" title="Rocket sled">rocket sled</a>.
</p><p>Indy then walked into what appeared to be an ordinary American town, but soon came to realize that it in fact was a <a href="/wiki/Doom_Town" title="Doom Town">test site for nuclear bombs</a>. Indy, once again narrowly escaped with his life, when he hid inside of a fridge lined with lead, which saved him from the enormous explosion. Indy was then captured by the <a href="/wiki/FBI" title="FBI" class="mw-redirect">FBI</a>, who suspected him of being working with the Russians. He was interrogated by the agents <a href="/wiki/Smith" title="Smith" class="mw-redirect">Smith</a> and <a href="/wiki/Taylor" title="Taylor">Taylor</a>. At the military base Indy was defended by his old friend, General <a href="/wiki/Bob_Ross" title="Bob Ross" class="mw-redirect">Bob Ross</a>. Indy then told the agents of the Russian woman he had met, and they identified her as Irina Spalko – one of <a href="/wiki/Stalin" title="Stalin" class="mw-redirect">Stalin</a>'s best agents.

<p>When Jones returned his teaching duties at <a href="/wiki/Marshall_College" title="Marshall College">Marshall College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Bedford" title="Bedford">Bedford</a>, he discovered that his encounter in Nevada had gained him the wrong kind of attention: the Red Scare was on, the government was relentlessly searching for Communist infiltrators, and Jones' presence at a top-secret military installation in the company of a Russian special forces unit made certain people wonder if he did not share their sensibilities. The FBI ransacked his offices, and this scared the administration at Marshall College into pushing for him to be fired. <a href="/wiki/Charles_Stanforth" title="Charles Stanforth">Charles Stanforth</a> succeeded in getting the concession that he be placed on indefinite leave with pay, but to do this, Stanforth had to tender his own resignation.
</p><p>Indy decided to leave Bedford and look for available jobs elsewhere, but just as his train was leaving, he was approached by a young man on a motorcycle, who asked for his help. Indy walked off the train, and as he was talking with the young man over a cup of coffee, the latter presented himself as "<a href="/wiki/Mutt" title="Mutt" class="mw-redirect">Mutt</a>" Williams, the son of a woman who apparently knew Indy. Mutt’s mother had recently disappeared when looking for Williams’ surrogate father and Indy’s old schoolmate <a href="/wiki/Harold_Oxley" title="Harold Oxley">Harold Oxley</a> in <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a>. Oxley had gone looking for the <a href="/wiki/Crystal_Skull_of_Akator" title="Crystal Skull of Akator">Crystal Skull of Akator</a> and the lost city of <a href="/wiki/El_Dorado" title="El Dorado" class="mw-redirect">El Dorado</a>, but had not been heard of in some time. Mutt’s mother had sent him a letter telling him to find Indy. Upon hearing this, Indy agreed to accompany Mutt to Peru. They were, however, ambushed by a group of Russian spies, and had to fight their way out of the restaurant. Indy then sat on the backseat of Mutt’s motorcycle, and after an intense chase through the streets of Bedford, they relocated to Indy’s <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones%27_house" title="Indiana Jones' house">home</a> where Indy told Mutt everything he knew about the Crystal Skull.
</p><p>Indy and Mutt flew to <a href="/wiki/Nazca" title="Nazca">Nazca</a> in Peru, where they started looking for Oxley in a <a href="/wiki/Nazca_sanatorium" title="Nazca sanatorium">mental hospital</a> where he had been staying. In Oxley’s old room they found it full of carvings of the Crystal Skull. Through Oxley's clues, Jones realized that <a href="/wiki/Francisco_de_Orellana" title="Francisco de Orellana">Orellana</a>'s cradle actually meant Orellana's resting place and discovered a map on the floor of Oxley's cell, showing a cemetery. Driving up on Mutt's motorcycle to the <a href="/wiki/Chauchilla_Cemetery" title="Chauchilla Cemetery">Chauchilla Cemetery</a>, the two began searching for <a href="/wiki/Orellana%27s_Tomb" title="Orellana's Tomb">Orellana's Tomb</a> but were ambushed by two Nazca cemetery warriors wearing skulls as masks. Indy and Mutt managed to defeat them, and walked into the hallway leading to the tomb. They found seven mummies, and behind Orellana's corpse, Jones found the Crystal Skull. As they left the tomb, however, they were captured by Spalko and her men, who had been able to follow Indy thanks to Mac.

<p>In the Russian camp, Spalko tried to unlock the secrets of the Crystal Skull by using its telepathic powers on Indy. Mac made her stop before it killed Indy. Outside, Indy found Oxley, appearing completely deranged. Spalko tried to force Indy to help her by first threatening to kill Mutt and then his mother, who was revealed to be none other than <a href="/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood" title="Marion Ravenwood">Marion Ravenwood</a> – Indy's old girlfriend. Jones then deciphered Oxley's mumblings, and realized that they gave clues to the whereabouts of El Dorado. While everyone was distracted, Mutt seized the opportunity to escape by setting one of the tents on fire. Indy, Marion, Mutt and Oxley ran away, but stopped as Indy and Marion fell into a pit of dry sand. Thinking they were about to die, Marion revealed to Indy that Mutt’s real name was Henry Jones III, and that he was his son. Mutt threw them a large <a href="/wiki/Rat_snake" title="Rat snake">rat snake</a> to use as rope to climb out of the pit. Indy was finally able to make his way out of the pit, even though his phobia of snakes made it difficult for him. The Russian soldiers arrived and captured them again.
</p><p>The following day, the Russians travelled through the thick jungle with a caravan of trucks, one of which was transporting Indy, Marion and Mutt. They took control over the truck, and Indy used an RPG to blow up the tree-wrecking Jungle cutter. A long and intense chase ensued as Indy and Mutt tried to reclaim the Crystal Skull from Spalko’s grasp. In the chaos, the skull happened to come into Oxley’s hands. The caravan soon stumbled into an acre of dry ground, which happened to be the nest of thousands of giant, vicious driver ants called <a href="/wiki/Siafu" title="Siafu">siafu</a>. The ants attacked, and Indy beat Dovchenko to his death as he fell into a pile of ants.
</p><p>Indy, Marion, Mutt, Oxley and Mac (who now appeared to be on Indy’s side) escaped by driving the truck over a cliff and landed on a huge tree. They then proceeded to fall through tree vast waterfalls. Having survived this, they entered a cavern shaped as a human head. They passed a tunnel with carvings of people with unnaturally elongated craniums. They were then ambushed by a band of <a href="/wiki/Ugha" title="Ugha">Ugha</a> natives, who chased them out of the temple and into the open. Oxley brought forth the skull, and the natives backs away.
</p><p>Indy and the others climbed to the top of a <a href="/index.php?title=Mayan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mayan (page does not exist)">Mayan</a> pyramid with an obelisk over key. Indy figured that to open the "Palace of Eternity", one had to move the obelisk. As Indy and the others emptied the obelisk of sand, the construction started to move. The group was sucked underground.

<p>Pursued by Spalko and her soldiers, they then arrived at the <a href="/wiki/Temple_of_Akator" title="Temple of Akator">Temple of Akator</a> where they found thirteen crystal skeletons. Spalko, returning the Crystal Skull to the body of one headless skeleton, activated a force in the room that combined the thirteen bodies into a single living alien. While the alien endowed Spalko with the "great gift" of knowledge, Jones and the others escaped the crumbling Temple. Unfortunately for Spalko, the alien knew of her evil intentions and used its transfer of knowledge to overwhelm her human brain, causing her body to spontaneously combust. A portal opened in the ceiling of the Temple which the Russian soldiers were sucked into, as well as Spalko's remains and the remaining Russians. Mac's true loyalties remain ambigous, since, though he appeared to be a Soviet double agent, Jones still tried to save him, trusting that that was the right thing to do. Mac, however, was humbled by his old friend, and went peacefully to prevent himself from delaying Indy's escape. It is unknown if he died or simply was "abducted" since the portal through which he disappeared was later actually revealed to be the bottom of a huge flying saucer.
</p><p>Following the Peru adventure, Jones was allowed to resume his teaching position at Marshall College, and was promoted to associate dean under Charles Stanforth, who also got his job back. With their relationship rekindled, Indiana and Marion wed soon after, with Harold Oxley and Charles Stanforth as witnesses.<sup id="cite_ref-KotCS_44-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-KotCS-44">[45]</a></sup>

Complementing his compassionate character was an unshaking sense of integrity and respect for knowledge, believing that culture was something to be shared and preserved for future generations. However, Indy's belief that artifacts belonged in a museum earned him a fair share of enemies, along with a reputation as a graverobber in some countries.

<p>Aside from his proficiency in his trademark whip, Indy is shown to be a competent unarmed combatant, even briefly demonstrating ability in Northern-style Kung Fu in the South China Seas when attacked by pirates in his quest for the Eye Of the Peacock. Although his proficiency in Eastern Martial Arts was never explicitly retconned into the film series proper, Indy is nevertheless shown to be at least skilled in US Marines Close Quarter Combat (CQC) techniques from <i>The Temple Of Doom</i> onwards.
