<p class="cnn_pt_notpad"><strong>(CNN) &#8211;</strong> John McCain’s campaign defended Sarah Palin Tuesday over a report that highlighted some of her travel expense claims as governor, and announced the launch of the “Palin Truth Squad” to fight future attacks on the VP nominee.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/08/AR2008090803088_pf.html"><strong>The Washington Post</strong></a> reported Tuesday that the Alaska governor had billed the state a per diem for 312 days she spent at home, and requested reimbursement for plane rides and hotel rooms for her husband and children, including a $707 room when her daughter accompanied her on a trip to New York to attend a Newsweek forum.</p>
<p>The paper noted that officials said the claims were justified under existing state regulations.</p>
<p>The McCain campaign said that Palin had reduced yearly travel expenses by roughly 80 percent of the amount spent by predecessor Frank Murkowski, in part by selling the governor’s private jet. Roughly half the $93,000 spent went to cover expenses incurred by her family. In a post on the campaign’s Web site, adviser Michael Goldfarb <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/McCainReport/Read.aspx?guid=c7f6f5f4-dcc5-4ef0-b1af-c25b8d93ed8d" target="_blank"><strong>told supporters</strong></a> that Alaskans were paying “pennies on the dollar,” and accused the Washington Post of “hunting for ‘scandal.’”</p>
<p>“As governor of the state, Palin is expected to travel across Alaska to meet her constituents and attend community events. As a mother of five, she occasionally brought her children with her,” wrote Goldfarb. “Her travel-related activities have been appropriately documented, are completely transparent, and entirely legal. She also saved Alaskan taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in the budgeting process and hundreds of thousands in cutting waste from her own office. It is an impressive record of reform by any measure.”</p>
<p><span id="more-17819"></span><br />
The McCain-Palin team has made her record on cost-cutting a central element of her vice presidential bid.</p>
<p>The campaign — which has been sending “fight the smears” e-mails whose tone echoes similar messages from Barack Obama’s campaign — also said staffers and major campaign surrogates at the state and national level were forming an official rapid response team that will respond to rumors about the Republican vice presidential nominee, sending alerts and campaign statements to voters and reporters.</p>
<p>“We will not allow those on the left and in the media to smear a woman who has always served her constituents with honor,” the campaign said in a statement. “We know the truth and are committed to ensuring it as well."</p>
<p>The McCain-Palin team has campaigned on media coverage that they describe as excessive or unfair.</p>

      <p>Not much of a defense. 700 dollar hotel rooms to send her kid on a trip. She wasn't even with her. If our kids want NY trips we have to pay for them. I wonder what else is in the 93000 travel expense.</p>

      <p>So, tell us McCain, did she sell that plane on Ebay, or was that just another fabrication?  </p>
<p>Really find it interesting (okay, yeah, I really mean sickening) how you guys keep saying that BO took $1 billion in earmarks for Illinois, when the real number is $311 million.  Compare that to your "reformer" running mate who has the highest per-capita earmark receipt of any state in this nation.  </p>

      <p>Can someone start the discussion as to why McCain and Palin still are together on the campaign trail?<br />
I think that, at least in theory, the McCain camp is concerned that McCain would draw less crowds than his running mate....thus making him less appealing by showing that the people aren't there for his "message" at all.</p>

      <p>This woman charged the state of Alaska for when she was AT HOME.</p>
<p>This is a woman who claims to be against unnecessary government waste.  But here she was, charging the government for being at home.</p>
<p>"Per diem" charges are for travel, not for being at home.  Can you imagine if Arnold Schwarzenegger charged the state of California for living at home?  If I charged my employer per diem when I was at home, I'd be fired.</p>
<p>Yes, it may be "pennies on the dollar", but that's not the point.  The point is that it's not ethical, even if it's legal.  And the other point is that it's hypocritical of her to do this.  She's essentially double-dipping from the state of Alaska.</p>

      <p>McCain is succeeding in distracting SOME of the American people from the real issues. The Republicans want to win the nomination on personality.....I want a campaign on the issues and I will broadcast just as loud as McCain to get my voice heard.  I'm not a disgruntled Hillary voter or a disenfranchised woman. So get Read Republicans ..keep bringing on your shenanigans and get your face slapped with the real truth about how to campaign  with integrity. McCain does not know the meaning of the word or can even spell the word "integrity." He truly a Ma-vo-WRECK!</p>

We are truly in the age of trash TV, where superficiality trumps substance.  Sad.  So sad.  Our forefathers would be ashamed.</p>

      <p>Maybe if she were accessible to talk to the media, we could get the data we need to "know" Palin the candidate.   With her being sequestered by the Republican campaign handlers, these stories are all we have to go on.   </p>
<p>The Republican campaign is forcing there to be questions in the biggest area of all:   What is her competence level, her ability to make decisions and think on her feet?   I can only conclude that they are very poor, given that they don't trust her to be out on her own and say anything that is not scripted for her.</p>

      <p>Let me see if I understtand this. Sarah Palin as governor sold the governors Jet( not on e-bay for a profit, but with a broker at a loss of $700,0000) and now is claiming that she has saved the taxpayers of Alaska lots of money and that justifies her charging the tax payers for her staying at home working. I think the bottom line is she has cost them alot more than she's saved, but its probably legal (maybe not ethical, but when did that ever stop a politician). Mar-Republican in PA.</p>

___________________________________________________<br />
How is that twisting the facts?! These claims are true they are well documented in financial statements. The article also mentioned that this isn't illegal, it just doesn't look good for someone claiming to be a 'fiscal reformer'  billing the state for meals when they are at home! What 'official' business could her kids have possibly be on. I'm confused by your entire quote....I mean are you talking about the Republican...LOL we know that's their motto Lie, and Lie again and if you get caught repeat the Lie someone's bound to believe you.</p>

      <p>I think that it is funny that McCain is now defending Palin, while the democrates don't have to really defend Obama anymore like they did when he first was on the scene.  Also, notice how McCain and Palin are campaigning together while Obama is in one state while Biden is in another.  Is it because McCain doesn't want to leave Palin alone to campaign where she could blow the whole deal of reform? McCain needs to let go of his kid aka Palin and let her fend for herself and see how she does.  Obama and Biden are in different states as is Hillary.  They aren't all campaigning together.  Maybe they trust each other more than McCain trust Palin?  There a question to ask yourself</p>

      <p>If Sarah Palin is a true reformer as she claims, she wouldn't have bilked Alaskans for all these charges &#8211; it may be legal but it's not right. </p>
<p>If Sarah Palin were a real reformer she would have called BS on the Bridge to Nowhere BEFORE Congress got up in arms about it, not after.</p>
<p>If Sarah Palin were honest, she'd admit she was stretching the truth on her "thanks but no thanks" line she CONTINUES to use on the stump. This is all about fooloing people into thinking these two Republicans are mavericks, and they're not at all.</p>

      <p>If anyone in industry claimed per diem for staying in their own house they would be fired.  If they did it to the tune of "Palin's" claims, they would be prosecuted.  She has demonstrated business as usual in politics.  How can people blindly support someone that they know so little about?  At least find out who she is, what she has done, and what she will do before you drop to her feet and start kissing........</p>

      <p>More than anything else I fear about Sarah Palin is her affiliation with the Evangelical Christian movement.   As far as media coverage being unfair?  I guess the Republican party refuses to believe that we as voters need to know who this person is.  How can make an educated vote if we don't know about her beliefs and governing process?  Maybe the Republican party just doesn't want us to know!</p>

More to come...and the repubs of course can just deny, deny, and claim "Oh the press is being mean to her" well if she were not a woman th epress would ahve been all over worse than they have been. She is playing the sexism charge, and her handlers have her on short leash.

      <p>It is pathetic what I see happening in my beloved country. After 8 years of total and complete failure by Bush and the republicans the American people are considering putting back the Republicans for 4 more years. This should have been a one sided affair. We must be the laughing stock of the world right now. Sarah Palin was brought in to get the pity votes. Nothing else! After all McSame had so much more time than Obama to choose a running mate and he ended up with Palin one week after the Biden announcement.<br />
John McSame is a great war hero. So therefore to honor that we must vote for him. And Sarah Palin looks nice and pretty and speaks nice so let us vote for her. What kind of UTTER CRAP is that? What about the issues and peoples lives? Is it that the WalMart moms have not lost enough sons and daughters yet in the Iraq war to wake up? Are we better off as a nation than we were 8 years ago? Tell the truth!!<br />
This is truly a fed up American.<br />

<p>Just because she cut cost down from her predecssor doesn't mean all her cost are legitimate. Get real Mr McSame. </p>

      <p>FactCheck you should really read factcheck.org.  Every "slime" as they put it about Palin has turned out to be FALSE even the Bridge to Nowhere.   How about CNN posting how Palin wanted to send The Bridge to Nowhere money to Katrina victims while Obama/Biden nixed it.   Maybe CNN can do some digging on that.   Isn't a Governor entitiled to an expense account like Obama was when he took his family and friends on the campaign jet to Hawaii?  He isn't even President yet and he is using his jet like Airforce One. LOL</p>

Is there anyone in the media besides Randi Rhodes and Bill Maher that will call them on their lies?  Stop with the CORPORATE MEDIA POLLS, they are completely inaccurate.  If you want a poll, look at the conventions.  The attendance says it all.  John McCain couldn't fill a stadium even when he was considered a Maverick.</p>

She may have been pregnant at 16 aand mom flew 10 hours back to Alaska from Texas after her supposedly water broke just to have her baby in Alaska. Ohh wait one more minute...not only did she fly 10 hours to Alaska and not go immediately to the hospital...she drove another 45 minutes to the hospital of her choice to have the baby. All in 12 hours after water had already broke? Come on!! He daughter was still sick with mono during that also right? Why are there no pictures from any of the conventions in Texas or anywhere else for that matter to refute the questions. Ohhh...again my fault she toook one with a plump belly for a camera crew.

      <p>Does "quality of life" mean anything to you?  Regardless of one's bias on this, this is a public servant making the best of her responsibilities both to her public as well as to her family - on one can fault you on that.  Having done business with the federal government myself, they are "people too" and have permitted certain costs similar to the hotel costs because our proposed alternative saved the Government many thousands of dollars - just as Palin's plans did (selling the plane, etc.).  It is convenient to be high and almighty and debate only the data you feel convenient - but a whole different picture emerges when you consider the whole picture and give credit where credit is due.  Palin seems to have made some very prudent and economical choices.</p>

      <p>Note that when Obama has to defend against a smear, the attack is usually a completely unfounded internet rumor that has been emailed all over the web.</p>
<p>When McCain has to defend against an attack, it's a recorded fact that the media has found and is reporting on. It's a recorded fact that Palin went on record supporting the Bridge to Nowhere before she went on record against the bridge when it became unpopular. It's also a recorded fact that she put one of her daughters up in a room that cost $707/night.</p>

      <p>Before anyone casts any stones at this story, they had better look at how much their own govenor , senator , and representative  are being reimbursed.  A few of their statements and you might just change your mind.</p>

      <p>I do not think people are reading this carefully. It also said that Palin travel expenses is 80% less than the previous Governor. Looks like Obama friends in the media are getting desperate! Anyway, I hope the media does an analysis on Biden's travel expenses as well.</p>

      <p>I hold a pretty high position within my company and travel a great deal on compnay business and I can tell you that if I dropped $707 a night on a hotel room there would be red flags flying all around.  The fact that this was taxpayers money and she's supposed to be a fiscal hawk makes this an issue.  The McCain camp is trying to make everything that comes out about Palin just smears and excessive reporting.  Where's the smear in the WaPo story and how is this exessive?  He's the one touting her experience as a fiscal hawk as the main reason to vote for her and McCain. Why can't the American voters get a look at her actual record and make a decision.  We just can't go on what she says in prepared remarks on the stump.</p>

      <p>I wonder if the Palin administration offered the same perk to all state employees with travel requirements.  I doubt it &#8211; more likely it's another example of Palin believing that one set of rules apply to her, and another to everyone she wants to govern.</p>
<p>When either my wife or I travel for our jobs and want to take along our family, we pay the incremental costs ourselves.  We accepted jobs with responsibilities that require sacrifice, and live with the consequences.</p>
<p>Sarah Palin as VP of the USA...a sure sign of the Apocalypse. Perhaps that is why the rabid right is so excited about her!</p>

      <p>I might not argue with Palin's travel expenses ( maybe those of her family members at taxpayers expenses), but how does one justify charging the State of Alaska (the taxpayers) a per diem for 312 days while she was at home. That makes no sense at all. </p>
<p>It seems perhaps that Palin is finally getting vetted like the other candidates have been. Forget the family issues. The kids and such have no place in such a vetting process and need to be left alone. But the American people have every right to know about Palin's record as Mayor and Governor, the decisions she made while Mayor and Governor, her stand on the major issues facing this country as well as her leanings from previous statements or comments, her spending of taxpayer money, her religious beliefs (as Obama's and Mcacin's have been reviewed), her treatment of employees and constituents while Mayor and Governor, her aquisition and use of special interests monies, who her political ackers are,  and so on.</p>

      <p>Palin has saved the citizens of Alaska millions of dollars, and people are pointing out she never fired her personal chef, ridiculous.</p>
<p>The reason why the Obama campaign is panicking and why they are mailing out a detailed description of what a community organizer actually does, and is begging powerful democratic women to support Obama is because Palin is the republican equivalent of Obama...she is getting Repulicans excited about the campaign, and has helped McCain surge ahead of Obama in the polls.  </p>
<p>So, instead of arguing whether or not Palin still has a personal chef, why don't we point out the fact that Obama's self-proclaimed "most important political experience" as a community organizer came when he was hired by a private party(as in, not elected), and told people in a community of which he knew success was not possible, how to live their lives.</p>

<p>It's a bummer when the truth comes home to bite the Repubs. They don't seem to be able to handle it.</p>

These reports are not coming from Obama. They are coming from the media. They are finally doing their job and not running scared from the Republicans.</p>
<p>Guess it is OK when they dig up stuff on the Democrats but please don't attempt to say anything about the Republicans!<br />
The Republicans are nothing but smoke, mirrors, and hypocrisy.</p>

   Palin may have said “Thanks, but no thanks” on the Bridge to Nowhere, though not until Congress had pretty much killed it already. But that was a sharp turnaround from the position she took during her gubernatorial campaign, and the town where she was mayor received lots of earmarks during her tenure.</p>

Palin did NOT want to send the bridge money to Katrina victims. That money was dispersed to other programs in the state. </p>
<p>What I want to know is, if she was SOOOOO concerned about the money being wasted, why didn't she order it returned? She didn't, now did she?<br />
We should ALL want to know why congress didn't make Alaska return the money when the project got cancelled.</p>
<p>This whole thing just stinks of corruption.</p>

      <p>Maybe McCain is thinking that we're all stupid, I don't know. How can he pretend to change Washington when almost all people in his staff are working for special interest groups? I watched his speech at the convention and I was not surprised. He still has the same policies than Bush. Fortunately I'm not stupid; that's why I'm gonna vote for real change with Obama. </p>

      <p>I think the We who will not allow those on the left and in the media to smear a woman, should take Sarah back home and let her continue to Govern Alaska. We don't need her. She's not experienced for the job, she's far from genuine and Americans don't need her religious views shoved down their throats. So take her back to Alaska so she can save you more millions! If she's that good you should have all tried harder to keep her!</p>

It was almost as bizarre and funny as the EBay Plane scandal segment Wolf Blitzer did.</p>
<p>Why not just accept that there is nothing there to dig up on her instead of waste time with this stupid stories. I would rather hear about the news going on in other parts of the world than this Jerry Springer type of reporting.</p>

      <p>How come the press is not all over Jews for Jesus comment by Sarah Palin pastor? Saying "What we see in Israel, the conflict that is spilled out throughout the Middle East, really which is all about Jerusalem, is an ongoing reflection of the fact that there is judgment. There is judgment that is going on in the land, and that's the other part of this Jerusalem Dilemma. When Jesus was standing in that temple, He spoke that that judgment was coming, that there's a reality to the judgment of unbelief. He said "I long to gather you, but..." what? "You were unwilling." God never forces His way on human beings. And so because Jerusalem was unwilling to receive His grace, judgment was coming. He says, "Look, your house has left you desolate!"... Judgment is very real and we see it played out on the pages of the newspapers and on the television. It's very real." This is scary!!!!!!!</p>

      <p>This is what happens with a surprise candidate.  We know so little about Mrs. Palin, it will take us until election day to get all these stories out.  Here's one major problem: if Mrs. Palin had been fully vetted by the McCain campaign, they could be on a proactive path to blunt the rumors and accusations before they are widespread in the media, rather than playing catch-up on all this stuff afterwards.<br />
John McCain, this is your mess, and you can't blame anyone else for it, especially the media.</p>

<p>Biden's comments about stem cell research were accurate, but he will offend many Christian families that struggle with the tradeoff between their beliefs and the hope provided by research.  For non-religious folk this will play well, but it isn't just the far right wing conservative evangelicals that struggle with this.</p>

   Palin may have said “Thanks, but no thanks” on the Bridge to Nowhere, though not until Congress had pretty much killed it already. But that was a sharp turnaround from the position she took during her gubernatorial campaign, and the town where she was mayor received lots of earmarks during her tenure.</p>

      <p>$700/night for a hotel room in NYC is not unreasonable, particularly if it was a suite, which would be a legitimate need for a governor.</p>
<p>Also, if you actually read the article in the Post, Palin did not charge the state for staying in her home.  Instead, she collected a per diem intended to defray her expenses while she was working at her home in Wasilla as opposed to the Governor's Mansion in Juneau.  She apparently did not collect a per diem for her children, although Alaska law would allow her to do so.</p>
<p>The charges appear to be legitimate and reasonable, and would not cause anyone to bat an eye in the private sector.</p>

McCain and Palin are both white ! because of that fact alone, America could see the largest up rising among latinos, blacks, all other nationalities that are not white..now...thats really scary...racist, no, I consider myself un biased..I am white ! and have friends of all colors..and when listening to some of them, I cant help but pick up on the "race" issue still with us..I really pray I am wrong !!!!</p>

I can't believe that some people would abandon their party!  Like Hillary has any similarities with Palin.  What a waste of a vote.  I wonder how Hillary would feel if she knew her followers were really voting for McCain.  Must not have been a true follower.</p>

      <p>Bottom line ... If you vote for McCain you're only destroying you're nation. McCain/Palin have no real agenda except to kill more American's soldiers and cizilians, let alone give big corporations more money which they dont need and take all they can from normal average people. Heck, you Government cant even tell one story to the attacks behind 9/11 and keeps changing the timelines and events.  </p>
<p>If you want to live in distress and struggle vote McCain. Put it this way, 33% of the US like Bush, the rest don't and many because they know he isnt right for the job and not qualified. So why would you put Palin the unknown in? and McCain the Bush Campaigns Carbon Copy?</p>

      <p>From what I understand there are certain expenses that political figures can claim and they are legal.  It may sound unbelievable to us, but that is the way the government functions.  Just as many people can claim expenses on a work related trip for their company.  It is easy to condem her, as well as all other politicians, but we just don't have all the facts.  Some of the expenses seem odd to say the least without any other information, like the trip to NY by her daughter, but some do not apper so odd, like the food expenses, seeing as governors have a full time cook when in office that are quite expensive as well, which she would not have utilized. </p>
<p>What is more concerning is the time spend at home.  300 days.  Now, some jobs can be done from home.  However, I think when working for the public, the individual has to sacrifice a lot, and one such sacrifice should be (and this is just my opinion) to be in the governor's house majority of the time or the white house (when president).  </p>
<p>I would imagine that many parents would be very concerned if a principle of a school spend a majority of time working from home.</p>

      <p>It's amazing that you have to do all of that for someone who is only the VP. That's because she can't defend herself. Same reason she hasn't been on any talk shows, sunday political shows, etc. Its because she doesnt have the ability to defend herself. Just goes to prove that his pick was the wrong pick. Yes, it's deflecting American voters from focusing on the issues and focusing on poor helpless VP candidate Sarah Palin with her Bridge to Nowhere T-shirt wearing self!</p>

<p>CNN seems bent on reporting only their interpretation of the news. Just report newsworthy items and let us form our own opinion. Do all democrats let CNN do their thinking for them? You wouldn't know otherwise by reading most of the previously posted comments. </p>
<p>The bottom of the ticket matter less than the top. I'm waiting for some clear indication that Barack deserves my vote. I'd like to give it to him, but wish that Biden was on top (even though he's been in Washington a long time....)</p>

      <p>Yes John McCain is switching his colors and talk to match Obama's. Conservative Republicans are running as Democrats now. But be not fooled. This is not the reason for his recent poll bumps.</p>
<p>Stop looking for dirt on Palin because she is clean, maybe vindictive at best. The hard reality is that women identify with her because she looks and feels familiar to them. The problem is that they really can’t see how different she is from most of them. When they switch the Supreme Court next year, pro-choice goes out the window with it. But not for 4 years, but for the next 20 years. That is the wool being pulled over women’s eyes.</p>
<p>Problem is, women are not carrying this critical issue (their right to choose) in the forefront of their minds. They won’t get it tell it’s too late, and after the price for Palins seat proves too expensive in personal rights.</p>

      <p>Scott from Rochester and CAK,</p>
<p>The point is that many of the "per diem" expenses were taken when she was AT HOME, not when she was traveling.  You seem to ignore that inconvenient fact.  While this may have been legal, it certainly is not ethical, and it is also hypocritical when you look at her platform.</p>
<p>If you want to make an INFORMED decision, Scott, then you need to INFORM yourself with ALL the facts...not just some of them.</p>
<p>To CAK, you also ignore the "at home" part.  On top of that, it's irrelevant if her travel expenses were less than the previous governor.  That doesn't justify her actions.  She was taking travel expenses for being AT HOME.</p>
<p>Name me ONE employer that would allow such actions.  I can't think of any.  Yes, it may have been legal, but legal does not always mean ethical.  And when your platform is all about reducing wasteful spending, charging the government a per diem when you are at home is quite wasteful.</p>

      <p>At first I thought that many democrats and media pundits just hated Hillary because she was a Clinton and that's why they trashed her so bad, but now with the way they're going after Sarah Palin and her kids is very telling of the misogyny with any women that becomes a threat to Barrack Obama. The fact is that the majority of americans understand that Palin has saved millions in peoples tax money more than anyone in politics up to date. Get it! Hello! She has saved millions of dollars for her people! Keep on trashing her and  wait for the backlash. Enough is enough.</p>

<p>What lies are being spread about Palin? If anything we are just beginning to find out the truth about her. You just want a woman, it doesn't matter who it is. So much for you being a hillary supporter, you are a joke and I am glad you will now lose twice in the same election. Palin is against everything you once stood for, thats even if you stood for anything in the first place.</p>

      <p>Palin's expenses are considered valid in Alaska alone where corruption is the order of each day of everyone's political life and beyond. If, in fact, she did reduce the expenses rolled out by Murkowski it must be remembered she isn't even halfway through a term. In every other corner of both the public and private sectors, working from one's home is regarded as a perk, not a per diem expense &#8211; Palin simply manufactured a cozy little double-dip to scam the public funds.  Palin's answer to fighting corruption is to displace former corrupt politicians to become the beneficiary of the system they created. It's time people saw through her lies and the ones her supporters are willing to tell in her defense.</p>

      <p>A couple of comments, although yes, I've alredy posted.</p>
<p>1)  I don't think the issue is whether her expenditures are legal in Alaska.  The issue is whether she's as much of a reformer as the Repubs make her out to be.</p>
<p>2)  The Truth Squad thing is sticking in everyone's craw here because every word that comes out of the McCain camp lately is a lie.  A fabrication, a lie or a smear.  Yes, Obama has a page on his website dedicated to the smears put out against him.  But he doesn't lie about his opponent.  Every ad has been a true representation of McCain/Palin's positions.  If the truth about their positions is ugly, sorry.  But, Palin utters a lie every time she reads that same canned speech.</p>

      <p>This election isn't about Palin. It's not about people at all. It's about the issues. What do we want the new president to actually DO when he is in office?</p>
<p>Palin seems to me to be an average politician with the same sins, weaknesses, or flaws that most governors, senators, or representatives don't have. We are not going to find a saint to run for office &#8211; well, there is Nader, but he's not going to be elected. He is too saintly. Same with Jimmy Carter I guess. </p>
<p>Palin's nutty theology is not any stranger than Romney's. Obama's church has some pretty non-standard teachings as well. </p>
<p>In short, who cares? All this Palin talk is really distracting us from the election.</p>

Well this American is saying enough.  I am tired of  the ruthlessness, the disregard for the American people and the way of thinking that  they can do what ever they want.  We ARE NOT STUPID!!!  What is it that would make someone vote for McCain after all of the arrogance, deceitful and thuggish politics that have been thrown in our face...and the nerve of McCain to think that we would endure more of this! Palin is no better.  She has been called on her lies on "the bridge to nowhere" at least 7 times since she was selected as VEEP and people think its cute!!  Now the new ethics is saying there are charges being made that she charged her state for staying in her own personal home.  Don't you see the same things that the Bush-Cheney-McCain is doing? They are actually saying what they will be doing in the WHite House if they are elected.  We cannot be caught up in a euphoria...WAKE-UP PLease!! Our children's legacy depends on you doing the right thing.  God Bless!</p>

      <p>To Not falling in line,</p>
<p>So now you are falling in line with McCain. You think McCain gives a hoot about you or any womens issues? You are a fool. If the dems lose Hillary is not going to run again. Wake up. However, you are most likely a McCain staff member anyway just trying to stir up trouble so never mind.</p>

      <p>This site is full of pathetic Obama supporters who are blinded to the truth and will believe anything that he and the MSM (Main stream Media) will throw out there.  </p>
<p>Think for yourselves people!  If she was ripping off the state of Alaska, why the heck would she have an 80% approval rating!  They aren't stupid up there you know.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying Obama in defensive mode.  He's behind now and will do and say anthing to get elected.  Hmmm, sounds like something HE used to say about Clinton....</p>

      <p>Hmmmm.  Maybe this Palin truth squad should have been out and about before he chose her as his VP running-mate quick-flash style. </p>
<p>Do you really want a president who will make "quick-flash" type decisions?  Who will place an unqualified person in line to possibly become president after a few conversations and now thorough background investigation.  </p>
<p>Come on!  I applied for a basic fed job and underwent a 2 year background check.  How does a person become possible VP with a bachelors degree and no serious bkgrnd check?  </p>
<p>It insults my intelligence that they have the nerve to act as if she is more qualified than Obama and Biden.</p>

      <p>I think the country should brace itself for the onslaught of Sarah Palin news.  The reason is because she has NOT been vetted.  If she had gone through the proper process, she would be able to get off the bus.  But since the GOP want to play dirty, the press should give them a run for their money.  They should not leave one stone, or in Sarah's case, airplane unturned until they get the truth.  John McCain may not care about this country, but the press sure does.</p>
<p>Thank you news media&#8211;do your job and do it quickly.  If the GOP has their way, we'll have mandatory prayer in every public school.</p>

<p>The question isn't Are you voting for O'bama because he's black? ( no, just another thought of a bush replica in the white house should be enough unless all is forgiven for the last 8 years..pathetic) it should be<br />
ARE YOU NOT VOTING FOR O'BAMA BECAUSE HE'S BLACK? Basically this is truth for alot of people but they won't say because there prejudice and racist and cowards.</p>

      <p>No polls should be published or believed without the follwing accompanying them:</p>
<p>1. The wording of the questions asked.<br />
2. Breakdown of the Republicans, Democrats and Independents who were involved<br />
3. A breakdown of age, income and racial identity</p>
<p>With the sudden media attention to the white vote (funny how it was the black vote during the primaries; makes one wonder how racist the media is) it is paramount that polls indicate whether this demographic is the major focus of recent polls. As the press is fixated on this, it is only credible that this breakdown be included.</p>
<p>To refuse to accept anything else is manipulative of the polls and the election itself!</p>

<p>Is it me or does $68,000.00 &#8211; $64,000.00 + $60,000.00 = a net cost of an extra $56,000.00? I mean... I DID go to just ONE college, but I think I got the math down.</p>
<p>As Governor, she makes roughly $125,000.00 a year (plus, obviously, per diem pay backs at another $43,293.20, though some of that was for her children and husband traveling and lodging).</p>

      <p>I agree that we should focus on the issues &#8211; and one of those issues is McCain's poor judgement.  He rushed into a risky decision on his VP pick without properly vetting her.  And if that wasn't poor judgement enough &#8211; he lied repeatedly about her accomplishments.  Now we're finding out all of the lies, stretches, distortions and exaggerations that we were told about her.  If she had been properly vetted and introduced with honesty, we wouldn't be trying to sort through all this mess.  It's just one more in a long line of poor judgements from McCain.  Let's keep this discussion focused on the candidate &#8211; and how his risk-taking and poor judgement reflects on his character.</p>

      <p>Instead of "Truth Squad", perhaps Palin herself could answer these questions.  Oops! I forgot. The media has been so mean to the pitbull with lipstick so she is hiding away. Poor poor Palin. </p>
<p>Why does the republicans need a "truth sqad". Didn't they get the answers to these questions when she was so thoroughly vetted?  </p>
<p>Perhaps Charlie "softball" Gibson will ask her some serious questions.... However, I am not holding my breath. Look at the personal questions that Stephanopolis and he concentrated on during the Hillary vs Barack debate. Charlie Gibson used to be a respected journalist, now he is in the same category as Brit Hume.</p>

      <p>CNN STOP CENSORING ME! am a working mother of 2 with a condo I managed to scrape everything together to buy 2 years ago that is losing value every minute, with my credit rating sinking right along with it. Medical bills, gas prices, grocery prices! I'm not just on the brink of misery, I'm holding on by my fingertips to keep from falling off the cliff. And I have a good job &#8211; with benefits. And here is what really knocked me back on my heels: McCain plans on taxing my employer-paid medical benefits as income. That"s right. My benefit premiums paid by my employer become income and he taxes them!  I"m not rich. I will go under. I will have to opt out of the insurance to avoid those taxes &amp; keep my home. A lot of people will. Talk about increasing the uninsured!  Does this plan help working families like me? Who cares about Palin's past &#8211; it's my future I'm worried about.</p>

      <p>McCain campaign should have launched a Palin "truth squad" before he put her on the ticket. Now that the the truth is coming out about his un-vetted, extremist, lying, fanatical running mate he wants to squash the truth and sell the American people more lies, lies, lies.</p>
<p>McCain/Palin = Bush/Cheney  Lies, Lies, Lies, Lies, they even keep repeating their lies after they are revealed as lies. Yes, they really do think Americans are STUPID!  If American's stay asleep to the truth and hit the snooze alarm on Obama's wake up call to save and restore the American Dream we will all wake up something in the next four years screaming in terror in this ongoing American Nightmare! Then it will be too late and the wars these two war-mongering, gun toting lunatics will get us into are not something we or the world will recover from. Anyone who voted for Hillary and is now voting against Obama out of spite bettter look again at your own best interest. Destroying the world is really not worth your pettty satisfaction. WAkE UP AMERICA!!!!  Put your selfish, petty bias aside and step up to the plate of participating in restoring our country.</p>

And as for her talking to the press? why should she until she wants to. The press is not the best place to put anyone. Please don't think she is not prepared &#8211; there is a strategy behind it &#8211; you can bet on that.</p>

<p>I guess McCain's VP Pick  needs a squad of talking heads released upon the media like a squad of cockroaches because it's very apparent that  she is totally incapable of speaking on her own beyond a prepared script. </p>
<p>It unprecedented that a major party candidate for a national position is being sequestered  by party handlers and kept away from the press. I mean come on if Palin can't take the heat she shouldn't be in the kitchen let alone a heartbeat away from the Presidency.</p>

      <p>I just want Sarah Palin to know that the media and Obama camp are trying to use her faith to divide her supporters. She should stick with her beliefs because what Obama camp and the media does not understand is that her belief is one of the reasons why she is so popular and Obama and Joe Bidden are not. It is John McCain's Pro-Life stance that attracted Evangelicals to him and when he picked Sarah who has the same values, the game completely changed. So the media is going to put her in a corner by making her think that the public will not like her that much if they can force her to deny her faith. Well am sure she is smart enough not to even go there and stick to her guns and deny God at this point because her appointment by John McCain, I believe is ordained by God. This is the same reason Bush won the second term in Office in addition to his handling of the 911 atttack.</p>
<p>So Sarah please don't listen to them. You are in good hands with Evangelicals and God.</p>
<p>Also, Sarah's response to the media should be that "It is better to be a good Christian in a good church where love and patriotism is taught all her life than to be a member of a church for 20yrs. where the pastor preaches nothing but anti-American and hateful messages against fellow Americans"</p>

<p>Come on guys you are in trouble and can't you remember some of these arguments against Palin were used against Obama not that long ago and you called the GOP nasty words for doing the same thing (using the same arguments). McCain (and Hillary I might add) know darn well what the Dems do well and its Smear the opposition. </p>
<p>Dems really do not have a memory or don't care.</p>

      <p>So Gov. Palin billed the state $16,951 for eating and staying at home for 53% of her first 19 months in office and then bragged about firing the chef?  Like a good mother, she said her children knew how to make sandwiches &#8211; must have been some high-dollar sandwiches.</p>
<p>Alaska also paid $11,000 to fly a seven yr. old girl around.  That doesn't sound like good use of taxpayer money.</p>
