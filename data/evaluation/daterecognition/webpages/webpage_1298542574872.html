                <br>
                The company began with early projects for refurbishment works for 
                Southend Council and Waymade Health Care. Confidence in the company 
                grew and new build was ventured into, a new factory for Waymade 
                Health Care in Basildon was undertaken. From that experience a new 
                bowling alley in Ashford was built for a private client, during 
                which time their reputation grew and Southend Council appointed 
                the company for larger projects including new build for schools. 
                They won the Brentwood Diocese contracts for the new 6th form block 
                at St Thomas Moreâ€™s School for Boys, Westcliff-on-sea and Lady of 
              Ransome Church Hall, Rayleigh.</p>
              <p> Now growing from strength to strength, 
                they became accepted as an approved contractor for Essex Police 
                Authority and subsequently were in urgent need of larger premises 
                in Leigh. The company began to start their own development including 
                the Victoria Business Park, Southend. Their reputation for reliability 
                and quality continued to grow and they began to build houses and 
                apartments for their existing private clients, including sixteen 
                luxury apartments along the Esplanade, Southend; two luxury detached 
                houses in Benfleet; industrial and warehouse units at Burnt Mills, 
                Basildon; Essex Police Firing Range; Pitsea Police Station; Greenways 
                Junior School, Southend; and the luxury &amp; award winning project 
              at The Leas, Southend.</p>
              <p>The company's services include being the approved responsive 
                maintenance contractor for Southend Borough Council, Essex Police 
                and Essex County Fire Brigade. Current projects are diverse from 
                eighteen apartments at Wier Pond Road, Rochford to a luxury mansion 
                and swimming pool in South Benfleet. Current projects also include 
                a ten storey development of forty-five luxury apartments along 
                Southend Seafront - a contemporary modern design concept building 
                using brick and natural stone, glass, and copper and stainless 
                steel, and two new luxury detached five bedroom houses at Badgers 
                Hall, Benfleet.</p>
              <p> More recently the company have sympathetically renovated a derelict barn in Rawreth and it is here where their prestigious offices 
                now can be found. The building both stunning inside and out is the outcome of the meticulous conversion of a   dilapidated 19th century barn. Many features of the original building have been   restored and retained together with the restoration of the original pond and ditch network.
