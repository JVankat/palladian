	<br />
	<br />
	<h2><a name="g">G</a></h2>
	<p><b>Gift Funds:</b> Free down payment assistance that is given to a buyer in order to help them purchase a home.  VA Loans allow the use of gift funds to make the down payment on a home. There are third party organizations that offer this assistance, although they have recently come under scrutiny.</p>
	<p><b>Gift Letter:</b> If you are given money for a down payment from a friend, relative, or employer, you must have a letter stating that the person giving you the money does not expect to be paid back. If you borrow money that you are expected to repay, the mortgage lender will need to calculate this into your income to debt ratio.</p>
	<p><b>GPM-Graduated Payment Mortgage:</b> A type of mortgage loan where payments start out low and increase with time.  This type of loan is good for people who expect their income to increase over time.</p>
	<p><b>Grantee:</b> The legal term for a buyer in mortgage loan paperwork.</p>
	<p><b>GEM-Growing Equity Mortgage:</b> A type of mortgage where the payments increase overtime, but the extra money is applied to the principal of the loan in order to pay off the loan faster. </p>

	<br />
	<h2><a name="h">H</a></h2>

	<p><b>Home Loan Guarantee Program:</b> A program within the Department of Veterans Affairs that guarantees a loan for Veterans to purchase homes.  Because the loans are partially guaranteed by the VA Veterans are able to get home loans easier and under better terms.  This is one of many benefit programs offered to Veterans. Related Article: <a href="http://www.vamortgagecenter.com/va_benefits_info.html">Information on Your VA Benefits</a></p>
	<p><b>Home Warranty:</b> A warranty that covers any problems that occur with your home within a specific amount of time.  Some real estate companies offer a one year home warranty when you purchase your home that covers main systems such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and appliances.  If you build a new home, the builder offers a limited warranty on the home.</p>
	<p><b>Homeowner's Insurance:</b> Insurance that covers damage to your property or home.  This type of insurance also covers your personal belongings and contents of your home.  Homeowner's Insurance is required by your mortgage lender.</p>
	<p><b>HUD- The Department of Housing and Urban Development:</b> A government agency that aids people with purchasing homes, getting financing for a home mortgage, counseling and education for the home buying process, and much more.</p>
	<p><b>HUD-1 Form:</b> A list of the purchases and transactions involved when you buy a home through The Department of Housing and Urban Development and The Federal Housing Authority. </p>
	<p><b>Hybrid Mortgage Loan:</b> A loan to purchase a home that combines an adjustable rate mortgage with a fixed rate mortgage.  Most hybrid mortgages have a fixed interest rate for the first ten years after which time the interest rate becomes adjustable.  This type of mortgage is good for people who are not planning to live in the home during the adjustable interest rate period or who plan to refinance the mortgage before the interest rate begins to rise.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<h2><a name="i">I</a></h2>
	<p><b>Income:</b> Any money that you receive in a given period of time.  For the purposes of obtaining a mortgage, you should consider your steady monthly income when determining your affordable mortgage payment amounts.  You may not want to include income such as child support, interest on investments, or other variable amount types of income.</p>
	<p><b>Interest:</b> The money paid to a lender for the use of their money.  In the case of a mortgage, the interest is a percentage rate over a certain period of time paid to the mortgage company.</p>
	<p><b>Interest Only Loan:</b> A mortgage loan that allows the borrower to pay only the interest on the mortgage for a set amount of time before they start paying towards the principal.  People use this type of mortgage when they expect an increase in income in the future, do not plan to live in the home for a long period of time, or plan to refinance the mortgage on the home once their current mortgage begins requiring them to make larger payments.  Often, once the interest only period is over, the mortgage converts to an adjustable interest rate which is also undesirable if you plan to stay in the home for a long period of time.</p>
	<p><b>Interest Rate Cap or Interest Rate Ceiling:</b> The highest amount of interest that can be charged according to a legal agreement.  With adjustable rate mortgages, there is an interest rate cap that allows the mortgage lender to raise the interest rate to a certain point, and then the lender is not allowed to raise the rate any further. </p>
	<p><b>IRRRL- Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan:</b> This is a VA Mortgage Loan that takes mortgages in the VA Home Loan Guarantee Program and allows the owner to refinance the loan for a lower interest rate.  The loan can either be an adjustable rate mortgage refinanced to a fixed rate mortgage or a fixed rate mortgage refinanced to another fixed rate mortgage as long as the new interest rate is lower and your monthly mortgage payment decreases.  The VA does not allow you to take cash out of an IRRRL, but you may finance to pay for energy efficient home improvements or to take advantage of lower interest rate trends in the market.</p>

	<p><b>Lease-Purchase Agreement:</b> A way to purchase a home by renting the home for a set amount of time before purchasing.  This is also called rent-to-own and is extremely useful to people who need time to repair their credit or want to wait for lower interest rates before obtaining a mortgage loan. </p>
	<p><b>Lease-Purchase Mortgage Loan:</b> A way for low income families to purchase a home by first leasing the home and then purchasing it.  This option, offered by Fannie Mae, allows families to lease the property from the not for profit organization with the opportunity to purchase the home later.  Part of the monthly rental payments are saved in order for the renters to have down payment money at the end of their lease in case they want to purchase the home.</p>
	<p><b>Lender:</b> The company that loans you the money to purchase a home.</p>
	<p><b>Lender Appraisal Processing Program:</b> A program through which the Department of Veterans Affairs allows VA-approved lenders to conduct their own value appraisals on a property.

Related Article: <a href="http://www.vamortgagecenter.com/lapp.html">Lender Appraisal Processing Program</a></p>
	<p><b>Lien:</b> The legal right to ownership of a property or part ownership of a property.  In the case of a mortgage loan on your home, the lender has the legal right to the amount of money your home is worth up to what you still owe as your principal balance.  Any lien on a home is paid when the home is sold.</p>
	<p><b>Lifetime Cap:</b> This is the highest interest rate than can be charged over the life of the loan with an adjustable rate mortgage.</p>

	<p><b>Loan Approval:</b> When the lender agrees to loan money to a borrower based on information such as income, debt, assets, employment, and credit worthiness.</p>
	<p><b>Loan Servicing:</b> The maintenance required for any given loan.  In the case of a mortgage loan with an escrow account, the servicing is needed to take the monthly mortgage payment and split the money between the principal, interest, and the escrow account. Then, when the time comes for the homeowner's insurance and property taxes to be paid, the loan servicer is responsible for making those payments on time.  This fee is usually added to your monthly mortgage payment.</p>
	<p><b>Loan Guarantee Entitlement:</b> The amount of money that you can get from the VA for guaranteeing your home mortgage loan.</p>
	<p><b>LTV- Loan to Value Percentage:</b> The amount of a home you own compared to the amount of a home you still owe to a mortgage lender, expressed as a percentage.  For instance, if you put 25% down on a home, your Loan to Value Percentage is 75% because that is what you still owe to the mortgage lender.</p>
	<p><b>Lock-In:</b> An agreement with a mortgage lender that a specific interest rate will be guaranteed, or locked in, as long as the borrower closes within a certain period of time.</p>
	<br />

	<p><b>Market Value:</b> The value you home will sell for depending on the current real estate market trends in your area.</p>
	<p><b>Mortgage:</b> A loan that allows you to purchase a home in return for monthly payments over a set period of time that pays back the loan with interest. </p>
	<p><b>Mortgage Banker:</b> A company that makes mortgage loans to people in order to sell the mortgages for a profit.  Once the mortgage is closed, the company will sell it on the secondary loan market to another company that wants to invest in the mortgage in order to get the interest money.</p>
	<p><b>Mortgage Broker:</b> A person who takes the financial and credit information of people who are looking for a mortgage lender and facilitates the mortgage process by shopping for a mortgage loan for the borrower.  You will usually pay a commission fee for the services of a mortgage broker who, in essence, is the "middle man" of a mortgage loan transaction.</p>
	<p><b>Mortgagee:</b> A term used in mortgage loan paperwork that refers to the lender.</p>
	<p><b>Mortgage Insurance Premium:</b> The amount of money you pay, either monthly included as part of your mortgage payment or annually out of an escrow account, that insures your mortgage from default.  The FHA requires mortgage insurance for any borrower that is financing a loan through them and puts less than 20% of a down payment on the home.</p>
	<p><b>Mortgage Interest Rate:</b> The percentage of interest you agreed to pay in your mortgage loan terms.</p>
	<p><b>Mortgage Margin:</b> With an adjustable rate mortgages, this is the set amount of how much your interest rate can increase at each adjustable period of time.  For instance, if your loan agreement states that your interest rate cannot increase more than .5% in any 6-month period of time, this is your mortgage margin.</p>
	<p><b>Mortgage Note:</b> The legal paperwork of a mortgage loan that specifies the terms of the loan, including the monthly mortgage payment amount, the interest rate, the amount of the loan, and the length of time the term of the loan is for.</p>

	<br />
	<br />
	<h2><a name="n">N</a></h2>
	<p><b>Negative Amortization:</b> If the monthly mortgage payment is not enough to cove r the interest and principal amount due on the loan, the negative difference will be added to the loan.  This means that the amount you owe will increase instead of decrease.  A good example is a graduated Payment Mortgage in which the monthly payments start out low and grow overtime. This means that at the start of your mortgage, your payments may not be high enough to cover the principal and mortgage payments, but the difference is added to the total principal of the loan, which you will pay off in time as the monthly mortgage payments gradually increase.</p>
	<p><b>Notice of Default:</b> If a borrower goes into default, the mortgage lender will send the borrower this notice informing them that the mortgage contract agreement has been broken.  At this time, the borrower should contact the mortgage lender to work out a forbearance or terms of repayment for the missed mortgage amount.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<h2><a name="o">O</a></h2>
	<p><b>Origination Fee:</b> The fee the lender charges the borrower for the services required to create a mortgage loan agreement.  This usually includes underwriter costs, legal fees, and other fees associated with originating the mortgage loan.</p>
	<p><b>Owner Financing:</b> If the buyer cannot get a mortgage loan due to lack of down payment or derogatory credit, the seller may make arrangements to finance the loan for the buyer. In this case, the buyer would sign an agreement with the seller as to the loan terms.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<h2><a name="p">P</a></h2>
	<p><b>Payment Cap:</b> Some adjustable rate mortgages have a limit as to how high a monthly mortgage payment can increase, even when the interest rate is increased.  For instance, you may have a payment cap that does not allow the monthly payment to go over $800, but the mortgage company has increased the interest rate to where the payments should be $855 per month.  In cases such as these, the additional money owed would be added to the principal of the loan, creating negative amortization.</p>
	<p><b>PITI- Principal, Interest, Taxes, and Insurance:</b> These are the four monthly costs that are combined into a mortgage payment.  Some mortgage loan agreements do not include these additional housing costs, so make sure you know what your monthly mortgage payments include before you choose a loan.</p>
	<p><b>PUD- Planned Unit Development:</b> An association in a neighborhood of homes that shares some common property in exchange for monthly or annual fees for the association to maintain the common property.  An example of a PUD is a condominium development where each homeowner pays a monthly maintenance fee that is used for the upkeep of the property(mowing grass and removing snow), and the upkeep of any shared facilities such as playgrounds, tennis courts, or pools. </p>
	<p><b>Points:</b> Usually one point is 1% of the mortgage loan amount that is paid as an up front finance charge. Points are paid in order to negotiate lower interest rates on a loan.  Sometimes, if you pay more points at the beginning of your mortgage when you originate the agreement, you can save a lot of money overtime in unpaid interest.</p>
	<p><b>Power of Attorney:</b> A legal document that gives one person the full legal right and authority to act for another person.</p>
	<p><b>Prepayment Penalty:</b> The fee paid to a lender if you pay off your mortgage loan before a certain amount of time has gone by.  This penalty may or may not be written into a mortgage loan agreement.  It is designed to deter the borrower from refinancing the loan so that the lender is guaranteed a certain return on their investment.  If you are financing through the VA Home Loan Guarantee Program, you cannot have a prepayment penalty written into your mortgage contract.</p>
	<p><b>Pre-purchase Counseling:</b> First-time buyers should get counseling on the process of purchasing a home and obtaining a mortgage prior to beginning the process.  This is done in an attempt to give the borrower the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the purchasing process.  With FHA Loans, you are required to obtain pre-purchasing counseling before you can get a loan.</p>
	<p><b>Pre-qualification:</b> A borrower can give all of their financial and credit information to a lender. This lender will use this information to inform the borrower about what type of loans they qualify for and how much of a monthly payment they can afford based on the borrower's personal situation. This way, the borrower knows exactly in what price range they can shop for a home and is assured they can get a mortgage loan.</p>
	<p><b>Principal:</b> The amount of money that is loaned to a borrower. With most types of mortgages, the principal loan amount decreases every time a mortgage payment is made.</p>
	<p><b>PMI- Private Mortgage Insurance:</b> If borrower puts down less than 20% of a down payment when purchasing a home, the lender usually requires mortgage insurance until the amount of equity is built up to or surpasses 20%.

	<p><b>Promissory Note:</b> The legal document a borrower and his or her spouse must sign indicating they agree to pay the mortgage loan back to the lender.</p>

	<p><b><a href="http://www.vamortgagecenter.com/purchase.htm">Purchase</a> Contract:</b> The contract that is signed once the buyer and seller finish negotiating the terms of the sale of the home.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<h2><a name="q">Q</a></h2>
	<p><b>Qualifying Ratios:</b> Lenders look at asset-to-debt and other ratios in order to determine exactly how much the borrower can financially afford as a maximum mortgage amount.  The more you owe in debt, the less you will be able to borrow. This is because the lender considers your total monthly expenses when determining how high of a mortgage payment you can afford.  This is why it is important to rid yourself of as much unnecessary debt as possible, such as unsecured credit card debt, as possible before you apply for a mortgage loan to purchase a home.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<h2><a name="r">R</a></h2>

There is usually a meeting where the borrower sits down with the lending agent while the agent reviews all of the associated costs and fees of the mortgage loan.</p>
	<p><b>Real Property:</b> Any land, improvements to land or structures, and physical structures or buildings that someone is entitled to by ownership of a title or deed.</p>
	<p><b>Refinancing:</b> Getting a new mortgage loan that replaces and pays your existing mortgage loan in full.  This is like getting an entirely new mortgage loan, and is usually done in order to lower interest rates on a current mortgage loan or take cash out of the equity in a home.  If you have a VA Home Loan, you can refinance with the VA through its <a href="http://www.vamortgagecenter.com/cashout.htm">Cash Out Refinance</a> option or its Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loans, IRRRLs, which allow Veterans to refinance their current VA mortgage to a lower interest rate in order to save them money and lower their monthly payments. Related Article: <a href="http://www.vamortgagecenter.com/existingrefi.html">Refinancing an Existing Loan</a></p>
	<p><b>Rent and Mortgage Payment History:</b> A lender will look into the history of other dwellings you have inhabited in order to see if you make your payments on time and are credible in the area of housing payments.  Lenders will contact past landlords or look at your credit history from any previous mortgages to make sure you were never delinquent.</p>
	<p><b>Rescission Agreement:</b> The legal document that both parties sign in order to cancel a previously signed legal contract. If, in the case of real estate transactions, there was a signed purchase agreement and then the buyer or seller changed their minds about the home then a rescission agreement would have to be signed.</p>

	<h2><a name="s">S</a></h2>
	<p><b>Second Mortgage:</b> Another loan on the equity of a home.  The second mortgage takes secondary authority to the first mortgage on the lien to the home.  When the home is sold or foreclosure upon (in the case of a default), the first mortgage lien holder is paid first and the second mortgage lien holder is paid later.  Second mortgages usually have higher interest rates since they are higher risks because in the case of a foreclosure, the lender may not fully be able to redeem their investment.</p>
