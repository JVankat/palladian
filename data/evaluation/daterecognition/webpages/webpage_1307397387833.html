This article is mostly about the adaptive advantage of alkaloids in plants, and some remarkable examples of psychoactive (hallucinogenic) alkaloids found in some of the most amazing plants on earth.  Stimulant (or tranquilizer) alkaloids such as nicotine from tobacco (<font color="#FF0000">Nicotiana tabacum</font>), caffeine from coffee (<font color="#FF0000">Coffea arabica</font>), and cocaine from coca (<font color="#FF0000">Erythroxylum coca</font>) are highly addictive and clearly alter one's mental and physical state, but are beyond the scope of this article.  Likewise, narcotic, pain-relieving alkaloids from the opium poppy (<font color="#FF0000">Papaver somniferum</font>), including codeine and morphine, are excluded from this article.  Although marijuana (<font color="#FF0000">Cannabis sativa</font>) is often discussed in books about mind-altering plants, its active chemical tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is not an alkaloid.  It does not contain nitrogen and consists of both terpene and phenolic subunits--hence, it is called a terpenophenolic compound.

<font size="7">D</font><font size="4">uring the past 130 million years, flowering plants have colonized practically every habitat on earth, from arid deserts, boggy meadows and windswept alpine summits, to sun-baked grasslands, lush rain forests and wave-battered rocky shores.  They have replaced most of the ancient ferns and seed plants that dinosaurs subsisted on, and developed a complex and fascinating relationship with insects and mammals.  During these countless centuries of time, flowering plants have gradually evolved all sorts of ingenious protective devices to discourage hungry herbivorous animals.  Leaves and stems have developed a variety of vicious spines and stinging hairs (trichomes).  In some plants, the dense covering of silvery hairs may also provide other ecological advantages such as solar reflection and insulation in arid environments.  But mechanical defenses, such as spines and trichomes, are of limited value and probably would not deter all hungry herbivores, particularly the chewing and sucking insects.  Therefore, plants have developed a &quot;chemical warfare,&quot; a defense strategy based on a vast arsenal of chemicals which are toxic or distasteful to animals.  According to Daniel Janzen, noted authority of the Costa Rican rain forest, developing seeds of the tropical liana <b>Mucuna</b> (including <b>M. urens</b> and <b>M. pruriens</b>) are nearly free from seed predators.  [These vines produce the distinctive hamburger-shaped &quot;sea beans&quot; that drift ashore on tropical beaches throughout the world.]  In addition to a dense covering of stinging trichomes, the pods of <b>Mucuna</b> are rich in the potentially toxic amino acid L-dopa.  [L-dopa, precursor of the brain neurotransmitter dopamine, is given to patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease.]  Just as genetic variability and time allow agricultural pests to tolerate pesticides, so can some herbivores circumvent a plant's natural chemical defenses.  This &quot;predatory pressure&quot; has resulted in the evolution of an endless array of complex plant molecules, from gums and terpenes to alkaloids and phenolic compounds.  For example, in nettles (<b>Urtica</b> species) the sophisticated defense chemicals acetylcholine and histamine are employed in an ingenious system of &quot;injection hairs&quot; strategically placed throughout the plant.  When we touch these plants, we may be accidental casualties in a chemical warfare between plants and herbivores that has waged through countless millennia.</font><p>

<font size="7">O</font><font size="4">ne of the largest groups of chemical arsenals produced by plants are the alkaloids.  Many of these metabolic by-products are derived from amino acids and include an enormous number of bitter, nitrogenous compounds. According to R.F. Raffauf (<b>Plant Alkaloids: A Guide To Their Discovery and Distribution</b>, 1996), more than 10,000 different alkaloids have been discovered in species from over 300 plant families.  Alkaloids often contain one or more rings of carbon atoms, usually with a nitrogen atom in the ring.  The position of the nitrogen atom in the carbon ring varies with different alkaloids and with different plant families.  In some alkaloids, such as mescaline, the nitrogen atom is not within a carbon ring.  In fact, it is the precise position of the nitrogen atom that effects the properties of these alkaloids.  Although they undoubtedly existed long before humans, some alkaloids have remarkable structural similarities with neurotransmitters in the central nervous system of humans, including dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine.  The amazing effect of these alkaloids on humans has led to the development of powerful pain-killer medications, spiritual drugs, and serious addictions by people who are ignorant of the properties of these powerful chemicals.</font><p>

<center><a NAME="Ants"></a><h3><font color="#FF0000">A Tree Protected By Ants Instead Of Alkaloids</font></h3></center><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">housands of different alkaloids have been discovered from throughout the plant kingdom, but there are some species that do not contain any of these bitter, nitrogenous compounds.  One of the most remarkable examples of the &quot;competitive disadvantage&quot; of a tree unable to produce alkaloids is the bullhorn acacia (<b>Acacia cornigera</b>) of Central America.  The common name of &quot;bullhorn&quot; refers to the large, swollen thorns (technically called stipular spines) that occur in pairs at the base of leaves, and superficially resemble the horns of a steer.  In fact, the thorns of <b>A. cornigera</b>, and a related species <b>A. collinsii</b>, are so striking that they are often strung into unusual necklaces and belts.  In El Salvador the horn-shaped thorns provide the legs for small ballerina seed dolls which are worn as decorative pins.</font><p>

<font size="7">A</font><font size="4">ccording to the famous botanist G.L. Stebbins (<b>Flowering Plants:  Evolution Above The Species Level</b>, 1974), other species of <b>Acacia</b> growing in the same region of Central America (including <b>A. chiapensis </b>and <b>A. macrantha</b>) produce alkaloids, but grow much more slowly and live in drier areas than <b>A. cornigera</b>.  Apparently these other species of <b>Acacia</b> pay the price for their alkaloid defense system in terms of a slower growth rate, which enables them to compete only in the drier regions where the growth of competing vegetation is also slower and less vigorous.  The ability of <b>A. cornigera</b> to enter more moist, lush vegetation areas is apparently related to its evolution of another defense system that depends on a little hymenopteran helpmate rather than the production of bitter alkaloids.</font><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he &quot;swollen-thorn&quot; acacias of Central America are truly remarkable trees.  In the wild, their enlarged, hollowed-out stipular spines are occupied by fiercely biting-stinging ants that protect them from browsing herbivores and epiphytic plants that might shade them out.  The swollen thorns are not galls, they are not produced in response to chemical or physical stimuli from invasive insects imbedded in their tissues.  The amazing thorns are genetically-programmed structures that are formed with or without the presence of symbiotic ants.  On wild trees they are inhabited by colonies of <b>Pseudomyrmex ferruginea</b>, very aggressive ants with a painful sting.  Disturbed ants release an alarm pheromone and rush out of their thorn &quot;barracks&quot; in great numbers.  According to Daniel Janzen (<b>Costa Rican Natural History</b>, 1983), livestock can apparently smell the pheromone and avoid these acacias day and night.  Getting stung in the mouth and tongue is an effective deterrent to browsing on the tender foliage.  In addition to protecting <b>A. collinsii</b> from leaf-cutting ants and other unwanted herbivores, the ants also clear away invasive seedlings around the base of the tree that might overgrow it and block out vital sunlight.  According to Daniel Janzen (<b>Smithsonian Contributions to Botany</b> Number 13, 1974), the Central American swollen-thorn acacias lack the chemical defenses of most other acacias to discourage ravaging insect predators and competition, and symbiotic ants have taken over this vital role.  The acacias reward their ant helpmates with thorn &quot;condos&quot; to live in, carbohydrate-rich nectar from glands on the leaf stalks, and nourishing, protein-lipid morsels called Beltian bodies on the leaflet tips.  There is no known function for Beltian bodies, except to provide food for symbiotic ants.</font><p>

<font size="7">P</font><font size="4">rior to settling on a thorn acacia, the winged virgin queen ant goes on a mating flight to the highest treetop or nearby hill.  Here she gets inseminated by a winged male and then hunts for an acacia in which to lay her eggs. [This &quot;hilltopping&quot; phenomenon also occurs in San Diego County, California, where sexually mature adult male and female butterflies fly upslope to a rendezvous point at the summit!]  The queen ant cuts an entrance hole into a green thorn, hollows it out, and then deposits her eggs.  Subsequent entrance holes are cut by the new generations of worker ants.  All this astonishing, complicated behavior has evolved in a tree that for some reason doesn't synthesize alkaloids.</font><p>

<font size="7">C</font><font size="4">hile peppers in the wild may also benefit from a naturally-occurring alkaloid present in their fruits.  The active
ingredient causing the intense burning pain when you chew into the walls of these fruits, especially the placental region where the seeds are attached,
is the alkaloid capsaicin.  So
potent is this alkaloid that one millionth of
a drop can be detected by the human
tongue.  Capsaicin is not broken down
during the digestion process--this is why
you often get burned several hours later
after dining on chile peppers.  Like other alkaloids in the chemical arsenal of plants,  capsaicin may serve to discourage mammalian fruit predators.  Botanists believe that birds are immune to the burning sensation of capsaicin, and may serve to disperse the seeds.  Capsaicin may prevent hungry mammals from devouring the fruits, so that they can be eaten by fruit-eating birds who are attracted to bright red fruits.  Passing through the bird's digestive tract relatively unharmed, the small seeds are dispersed to other favorable regions.  According to D. Dewitt and P. W. Bosland (<B>Peppers of the World:  An Identification Guide</B>, Ten Speed Press, Berkeley, California, 1996), there are 5 species of <B>Capsicum</B> peppers native to the New World: <B>C. pubescens</B>, <B>C. baccatum</B>, <B>C. annuum</B>, <B>C. frutescens</B> and <B>C. chinense</B>.  The hottest chile peppers belong the <B>C. chinense</B> group, including the notorious habanero.  Although this species is named "<B>chinense</B>," it is not from China.  Actually, its center of origin is thought to be the Amazon Basin of South America.</font><p>

<center><a NAME="Datura"></a><h3><font color="#FF0000">The Deadly Datura</font></h3></center><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">here are approximately 25 different species of <b>Datura</b> throughout the world, including Europe, Africa, southeast Asia,
Central and South America, Mexico and the United States.  They are often called jimsonweed or &quot;thornapple.&quot;  The latter name refers to the spiny seed-bearing capsules.   Most of the species are low, shrubby or sprawling annuals or perennials, but
some tree-like forms may reach 11 meters (36 feet) in height.  The
tree-like forms are occasionally cultivated as ornamentals and are
usually placed in the genus <b>Brugmansia</b>.  They generally have
the same characteristic trumpet-shaped flowers as <b>Datura</b>
with striking color variations of red, pink and yellow.  Both genera belong to the Nightshade Family (Solanaceae), along with the deadly nightshade (<b>Solanum dulcamara</b>) , tomato (<b>Lycopersicum esculentum</b>), eggplant (<b>Solanum melongena</b>) and potato (<b>S. tuberosum</b>).  Many species of <b>Solanum</b> (called nightshades) are quite poisonous to humans if eaten raw.  Incidentally, the new sprouts of potato tubers contain the toxic alkaloids solanine and solanidine.  Until about a century ago the tomato was thought to be poisonous because of its toxic relatives.</font><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he common native <b>Datura</b> of the western United States, with rank-smelling foliage and large, white flowers up to 20 centimeters (8 inches) long is <b>D. wrightii</b>.  Sometimes the flowers are tinged with purple and
resemble oversized petunia or morning glory blossoms.  It is a
sprawling perennial with an enormous taproot that may extend more
than 60 centimeters (2 feet) into the ground.  <b>D. wrightii</b> has a
large geographic range, including California, Utah, Arizona, New
Mexico and Texas.  It is often listed in older references as <b>D.
meteloides</b>, a name that actually applies to a similar Mexican
species, <b>D. inoxia</b> ssp. <b>inoxia</b>.  Another species with smaller
flowers, <b>D. discolor</b>, is native to desert washes and riverbeds of
southeastern California and Arizona.</font><p>

<font size="4">The large, trumpet-shaped flowers of jimsonweed (<b>Datura wrightii</b>) are sometimes tinged with purple and resemble giant morning glory blossoms.  It actually belongs to the tomato family (Solanaceae) along with petunias, potatoes and tomatoes.  This remarkable plant is common along roadsides and riverbeds throughout the western United States, and is one of the largest and most striking of all native wildflowers.</font>

</TABLE></center><p>

<font size="7">A</font><font size="4">third species, <b>Datura stramonium</b>, is naturalized throughout the United States.  Most older references list <b>D.
stramonium</b> as an Old World species naturalized as an weed in North
America.  According to Dr. Robert Bye of the Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico (personal communication, 1987), <b>D. stramonium</b>
probably originated in the New World and migrated to the Old World
during pre-Columbian time.  It can readily be distinguished from <b>D.
wrightii</b> by its more erect habit, smaller flowers and distinctive
angular or prismatic calyx.  It is a cosmopolitan annual weed and
prolific seed-producer.  A dozen viable seeds planted in fertile
soil in spring may give rise to nearly 50,000 seeds by late summer,
an increase of more than 400,000 percent.</font><p>

<font size="7">A</font><font size="4">lthough jimsonweed is
synonymous with several species of <b>Datura</b>, this unusual
common name is actually derived from <b>D. stramonium</b>.  In 1676
British soldiers stationed in Jamestown, Virginia became
intoxicated by <b>D. stramonium</b> when it was inadvertently included in
their salads by the regimental cooks.  The episode was widely
publicized and the plant culprit became known as &quot;Jamestown weed&quot;,
and later as jimsonweed.</font><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he leaves, stem, root and fruits of <b>Datura</b> contain a battery of tropane alkaloids, the most potent of which are
atropine, hyoscyamine and scopolamine.  These alkaloids affect the
central nervous system, including nerve cells of the brain and
spinal cord which control many direct body functions and the
behavior of men and women.  They may also affect the autonomic
nervous system, which includes the regulation of internal organs,
heartbeat, circulation and breathing.  One autonomic response of
atropine is the dilation of pupils, once considered to be a
beautiful and mysterious look in Italian women.  In fact,
belladonna means &quot;beautiful lady,&quot; so named because sap from the
closely related belladonna plant (<b>Atropa belladonna</b>) was used as
eye drops to dilate the pupils.</font><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he action of tropane alkaloids at the cellular level is complex.  It is summarized by R.E. Schultes and A. Hofmann in the <b>The Botany and Chemistry of Hallucinogens</b> (1973) and in <b>Medical Botany</b> by W.H. Lewis and M.P.F. Elvin-Lewis (1977).  Tropane alkaloids are found in many other poisonous plants, including henbane (<b>Hyoscyamus niger</b>), pituri (<b>Duboisia</b> spp.), and mandrake (<b>Mandragora officinarum</b>), all of which were used extensively in witches' brews and folk medicines.</font><p>

This chemical structure is also found in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which transmits impulses between nerves in the brain and neuromuscular junctions.</font>
		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE></center><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he anesthetic properties of tropane alkaloids may relate to their interference with acetylcholine, perhaps by competing with it at the synaptic junctions, thus blocking or inhibiting nerve impulses.  It is interesting to note that the infamous tropane alkaloid, cocaine, is also a local anesthetic when injected into skin or muscle tissue.  This property led to the discovery and synthesis of the more potent compound, novocain, widely used in dentistry.</font><p>

<font size="7">W</font><font size="4">ithout getting into complicated anatomy and physiology, one nerve cell (neuron) connects to an adjacent neuron by a long extension  called an axon.  The axon branches into axonal endings, each of which attaches to the adjacent neuron at a synaptic knob filled with acetylcholine.  The minute gap or synaptic cleft within this knob is only about 0.02 micrometers.  As a nerve impulse (wave of depolarization or action potential) reaches this gap, acetylcholine diffuses across the synaptic cleft and activates the adjacent neuron.  Acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is deactivated or broken down by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, thus shutting off the action potential.  Organophosphate insecticides, such as malathion and parathion, bind to active sites on this enzyme, thus preventing the normal shut down of nerve impulses and destroying the nervous control of insects.  Nerve gasses developed during World War II have a similar effect on the nervous system.  Gulf War soldiers carried an atropine syrette to counter the possible effects of nerve gas.</font><p> 

<font size="7">D</font><font size="4">epending on the dosages, several tropane
alkaloids of <b>Datura</b> (when absorbed together) may have synergistic properties
resulting in extreme hallucinations, delirium and death.  Since the
alkaloids are fat soluble they are readily absorbed through the
skin and mucous membranes.  Volumes have been written about the uses and properties of <b>Datura</b> in the Middle Ages.  Most of the uses involved the consumption of potions or concoctions made from various parts of the plant.</font><p>

<font size="7">D</font><font size="4">uring ancient religious rituals in India, seeds were eaten by priests to induce hallucinogenic, prophetic and oracular states.  European priests apparently drank <b>Datura</b> for the same reason.  Some authorities believe the intoxicating smoke inhaled by Greek priests over 2,000 years ago at the Oracle of Delphi was <b>Datura</b>.  Thieves in India and Europe used <b>Datura</b> for centuries as &quot;knockout drops&quot; to rob their stupefied victims.  The plant was also known in China, where a law prohibited mixing it with wine and other drinks.</font><p>

<font size="7">I</font><font size="4">n the East Indies, women fed <b>Datura</b> leaves to beetles, and then fed the poisonous dung to faithless lovers.  Prostitutes in India added the seeds to their patron's drinks to induce sexual excitement.  In fact, the use of <b>Datura</b> as an aphrodisiac spread throughout India, the Far East and Europe, and was an important ingredient in love potions and witches' brews.  Specially prepared salves and ointments were also applied to various parts of the body.  The famous seventeenth century Dutch artist, David Teniers the Younger, made several paintings of witches preparing for their demonic orgy or sabbat.  The scenes frequently depicted a nude witch being anointed while she straddled a broom.  According to M.J. Harner, writing in <b>Hallucinogens and Shamanism</b> (1973), the use of a broom or staff was undoubtedly more than a symbolic Freudian act, for it served to apply the salves to sensitive vaginal membranes.</font><p>

<font size="7">C</font><font size="4">lay tablets from Babylonian and Assyrian ruins indicate that <b>Datura</b> was used medically in ancient civilizations several thousand years ago.  Greek and Roman physicians used <b>Datura</b> mixed with opium as a sedative and general anesthetic during surgery.  In fact, the use of scopolamine (one of the alkaloids in <b>Datura</b>) plus morphine as an effective pain reliever and sleep inducer was common practice until the nineteenth century.</font><p>

<font size="7">O</font><font size="4">ne of the most interesting medical cases of the 20th century involved a German physician, Dr. Carl Gauss, and the Lutheran Church.  In 1905, Dr. Gauss used extracts from <b>Datura</b> and morphine to induce twilight sleep treatment for women experiencing difficult child birth.  The church elders denounced Dr. Gauss because the <b>Old Testament</b> said that women were to bring forth in pain (<b>Genesis</b> 3:16).  The combination of scopolamine (one of the active alkaloids found in <b>Datura</b>) plus morphine was used for years as an effective pain reliever and sleep inducer; however, it is generally considered unsatisfactory for women in labor because of hallucinogenic side effects on the mother, and it may repress breathing of the newborn.</font><p>

<font size="7">D</font><font size="4"><b>atura</b> had a number of uses among Indian tribes of the United States, as well as Mexico and South America.  In fact, it is difficult to find a tribe that didn't use a species of <b>Datura</b> from their region in one way or another.  The hallucinogenic uses involved drinking an infusion made from the crushed roots or sometimes the crushed seeds fermented in water.  Some aboriginal Indians in South America gave a <b>Datura</b>-alcohol beverage to wives and slaves of dead warriors and chieftains.  The powerful brew induced stupor before they were buried alive to accompany their dead husbands and masters on the long journey to heaven.  The high priests of some tribes took <b>Datura</b> in order to communicate with spirits of the dead and with their gods.  The brilliant red-flowered tree <b>Datura</b> (<b>Brugmansia sanguinea</b>) is used today by herbal healers called &quot;curanderos&quot; in several countries of South America.</font><p>  

<font size="7">P</font><font size="4">robably the best known use of <b>Datura</b> by several North American Indian tribes was the puberty ceremonial dances involving the drinking of a &quot;toloache&quot; (<b>Datura</b>) infusion by young boys preparing to enter manhood.  The ceremonies generally involved wild erratic dancing, varied hallucinations, and finally unconsciousness.</font><p>

<font size="7">D</font><font size="4"><b>atura</b> alkaloids even have modern medicinal uses.  The fat solubility of tropane alkaloids is employed in a remarkable remedy for seasick mariners called Transderm Scopï¿½. A small, medicated disc resembling a circular Band-Aidï¿½ releases  small amounts of scopolamine into the bloodstream for up to 3 days.  The anti-nausea effects of scopolamine may relate to its anticholinergic action on the central nervous system, which results in inhibition of the vomiting reflex.</font><p>

<font size="7">F</font><font size="4">ive long stamen filaments are attached to the funnelform corolla at the throat.  The filaments extend as ridges down the inner corolla tube, forming 5 narrow canals to the base of the ovary where the disc-shaped
nectary is located.  The nectar canals can best be seen by
examining a corolla tube in cross section.  The curious name
&quot;revolver flower&quot; refers to nectar canals which resemble the
cylinder chambers of a 5-shot revolver.  At night the nectar oozes
along the length of the canals within the corolla tube.</font><p>

<font size="7">D</font><font size="4">uring mid and late summer the white, fragrant blossoms are frequently visited by large nocturnal hawk moths (family
Sphingidae).  They are sometimes called sphinx moths because the
alarm posture of the larva resembles the Egyptian sphinx.  Several
species of hawk moths are known to visit blossoms of <b>Datura wrightii</b>, but two of the most common are <b>Manduca quinquemaculata</b>
and <b>M. sexta</b>.  The larval forms of both are better known as tomato
and tobacco hornworms.</font><p>  

<font size="7">S</font><font size="4">ince <b>Datura</b>, tomatoes and tobacco
all belong to the Nightshade family (Solanaceae), the larvae are
apparently content to feed on whichever plant is available to them.  The larvae are remarkably camouflaged with green markings and are
difficult to spot as they rapidly devour your tomato plants.  After
feasting on <b>Datura</b> (or your tomato plants) all summer, the
robust, ravenous caterpillars crawl to the ground and burrow into
the soil where they undergo pupation.  Unlike many other moth
larvae they do not spin a cocoon.  Probably every tomato gardener
has unearthed the large, carmel-colored pupa with its peculiar &quot;jug
handle&quot; appendage, which is actually a case for the developing
proboscis of the adult moth.</font><p>  

<font size="7">I</font><font size="4">n warm regions there may be two
generations per year: summer pupae produce adults after only a week
or two; fall pupae remain in the ground until the following late
spring or summer.  The adult moth emerges from the pupal case and
pushes out of the soil, eventually flying off into the night. 
After mating the gravid (pregnant) female lays her eggs on a
convenient <b>Datura</b> plant--or on your prize-winning tomato
plants while you sleep.</font><p>   

<font size="7">A</font><font size="4">dult moths have remarkable proboscides
(tongues) up to 12 centimeters long (over 4 inches), long enough to
reach the base of a 10-11 centimeter (4 inch) corolla tube.  When
the moth is not feeding the remarkable tongue rolls up into a neat,
compact coil.  The common white-lined sphinx moth (<b>Hyles lineata</b>)
of the American southwest, with a medium proboscis of 3-5
centimeters (2 inches), can only reach nectar in the upper part of
the nectar canals.  Unlike the <b>Manduca</b> moths, its pupa lacks the
characteristic &quot;jug handle&quot; appendage.</font><p>

<font size="7">D</font><font size="4">rs. Verne and Karen Grant at the University of Texas have made detailed observations of hawk moth behavior (<b>Botanical Gazette</b> 144: 280-284, 1983). The hawk moth approaches the <b>Datura</b> flower
with its proboscis extended, lands on the blossom, crawls onto the
corolla throat, and inserts its proboscis into the nectar canal. 
This is somewhat unusual because on most types of flowers hawk
moths feed from a hovering position.  While feeding they often flap
their wings against the corolla throat.  The proboscis becomes
moist and sticky after insertion into the nectar canal, and pollen
from anthers adheres to it readily.  Pollen also gets on the head
and other furry body parts.  Thus pollen is transferred from one
flower to another as the moth rubs against sticky receptive stigmas
at the tips of long exerted styles.  According to the Grants, hawk
moths are the only flower-visiting insect with mouthparts that fit
the long, slender nectar canals of <b>Datura wrightii</b>.</font><p>

<font size="7">A</font><font size="4">nother fascinating aspect of the Grant's research concerns a rather unconventional type of floral reward for hawk moths visiting
<b>Datura</b> blossoms.  Several intoxicating alkaloids are known
to occur in <b>Datura</b>, but heretofore have not been correlated
with pollination.  Apparently <b>Datura</b> nectar is &quot;spiked&quot; with
alkaloids and the hawk moths seem to like it and come back for
more.  Sometimes they arrive early and hover around the flowers,
impatiently waiting for the blossoms to &quot;pop&quot; open.  Outside the windows at the <b>WAYNE'S WORDï¿½</b> headquarters we have observed what appear to be intoxicated moths flying erratically around <b>D. wrightii</b>, clumsily landing on blossoms and crashing into leaves or falling upon the ground.  With a flashlight their eyes
glow bright red in the darkness.</font><p>

<font size="7">A</font><font size="4">lthough the coincidence of proboscis and floral lengths in hawk moths and <b>Datura</b> is quite remarkable, these coadapted
partners have the ability to obtain nectar and set seeds in the
absence of each other.  According to Verne Grant (<b>Botanical Gazette</b>
144: 439-449, 1983), hawk moths may feed on a variety of bee
flowers and hummingbird flowers, and pollen-collecting bees may
visit <b>Datura</b> blossoms in late afternoon and early morning. 
The hippo staff at <b>WAYNE'S WORDï¿½</b> has observed large carpenter bees (<b>Xylocopa</b>) and bumble bees (<b>Bombus</b>) on the blossoms of <b>D. wrightii</b>, busily collecting pollen from the anthers.</font><p>  

<font size="7">F</font><font size="4">lowers of some <b>Datura</b> species are also homogamous (stamens and pistils mature at the same time) and are self-compatible and partially self-pollinating.  It is thus possible for one partner to migrate beyond the range of the other partner for a time.  According to Verne Grant, flexibility in the
pollination system permits migrational and evolutionary change. 
During times of general flower scarcity, hawk moths are more
dependent on <b>Datura</b> and related sphingophilous (hawk
moth-loving) blossoms because of the reliable nectar source which
is unavailable to other animals.</font><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">here are many other examples of large, white blossoms pollinated by nocturnal hawk moths, including the fragrant gardenias of French Polynesia and South Africa.  In fact, to reach the nectar of a
Madagascar orchid (<b>Macroplectrum sesquipedale</b>) requires a 30
centimeter (eleven inch) proboscis.  This remarkable orchid is also known as <B>Angraecum sesquipedale</B>.  Long before it was found in
nature, both Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace (founding fathers of
the principles of evolution) predicted that it would be a hawk
moth.</font><p>

<font size="7">M</font><font size="4">ost fungi are not deadly to humans and many are perfectly edible (and are quite delicious); however, some species are poisonous and contain potent neurotoxins.  Placing a silver coin in a pan of cooking mushrooms to see if it turns black is not a reliable method of testing poisonous mushrooms.  Unless you understand fungal terminology and know how to use a good taxonomic key (such
as <b>Mushrooms Demystified </b>by David Arora, 1986), the staff at <b>WAYNE'S WORDï¿½</b> does not encourage self indulgence on wild mushrooms.  The beautiful, red, fly agaric mushroom (<b>Amanita muscaria</b>) is unmistakable with its
bright red cap covered with white scales.  It contains the toxic alkaloid, muscimol, which is derived from ibotenic acid--an amino acid.  In Europe the mushrooms were reportedly left in open dishes to kill flies; however, according to some authorities, the flies are merely stunned or stupefied by the toxin, and may even regain control and fly away.  Although it is poisonous to humans, there are other species of <b>Amanita</b> that are much more dangerous and are potentially lethal if ingested.  Some of these dangerously poisonous species are death cap (<b>A. phalloides</b>), death angel (<b>A. ocreata</b>), and panther amanita (<b>A. pantherina</b>).  Fortunately these latter deadly poisonous species are not bright red and are seldom confused with <b>A. muscaria</b>; however, they may be confused with other edible mushrooms by inexperienced gourmets.  According to David Arora (<B>Mushrooms Demystified</B>, 1986), this species may be one of the most common causes of mushroom poisoning in the Pacific Northwest.  David Isaak (personal communication, 2002) stated in a recent e-mail message that in the Pacific Northwest, a number of people gather "the panther" for culinary purposes; cooking it in several changes of water to remove "most" of the psychactive materials.</font><p>

<font size="7">W</font><font size="4">hen ingested by humans, <b>Amanita muscaria</b> may produce visions and delirium, and it is perhaps one of the oldest known hallucinogens.  Recent studies suggest that this mushroom was the mysterious God-narcotic &quot;Divine Soma&quot; of ancient India.  Thousands of years ago, Aryan
conquerors who swept across India, worshiped soma, drinking it
in religious ceremonies.  Many hymns in the Indian <b>Rig-Veda</b> are
devoted to Soma and describe the mushroom and its effects.  According to the <b>Rig-Veda</b>, Soma is without leaves, seeds or branches, with a head and stalk or pillar [the structure of a mushroom]; its dazzling red skin is like the hide of the bull [the red cap]; its dress like that of a sheep, with woolly fragments remaining when the envelop bursts [the outer membranous envelop called the universal veil breaks as the stalk grows upward, leaving white remnants on the red cap].  This is a remarkably accurate description of the fly agaric mushroom <a HREF="amanita.htm#amanitab.gif"> (<b>A. muscaria</b>)</a>.  There are reports of Siberian tribesmen 
who ingested the mushroom to get intoxicated.  Since the active chemical (muscimol) passes through the body relatively unaltered, others would drink the urine from these men to get high.  This way a few mushrooms could inebriate
many people relatively safely and efficiently.  Lapland shamans eat fly agaric mushrooms for enlightenment, and some authors have postulated that this may have given rise to the flying reindeer and the red- and white-costumed Santa Claus legends.</font><p>

<font size="7">A</font><font size="4">pparently not everyone agrees that the &quot;Divine Soma&quot; is <b>Amanita muscaria</b>.  According to Terrence McKenna (<b>Food of the Gods</b>, 1992), the active alkaloid in fly agaric mushrooms (muscimol) doesn't produce the psychoactive effects described in the <b>Rig Veda</b> and other literature.  Although the identity of the Divine Soma was eloquently presented by R.G. Wasson in 1971 (<b>Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality</b>), Terrence McKenna has continued to question the effects of <b>Amanita muscaria</b>, and suggested other possible candidates.  Based on first-hand experience with these hallucinogens, he has suggested that a psilocybin &quot;magic mushroom,&quot; such as <b>Stropharia cubensis</b>, is the true Divine Soma.  In fact, he also states that the use of mind-altering psilocybin mushrooms by ancient humans in Africa may have been a catalyst in the development of language and religion in primitive cultures.</font><p>

<font size="7">A</font><font size="4"><B>manita muscaria</B> was apparently one of the sacred hallucinogenic mushrooms of the Incas, Mayans and Aztecs.  [Other New World psychedelic genera included <b>Psilocybe</b>, <b>Paneolus</b>, <b>Conocybe</b> and <b>Stropharia</b>].  For the Indians of Mexico, Central and South America, partaking of these mushrooms was a deeply religious experience, enabling them to communicate with their gods.  Cortez reported a mushroom
(resembling <b>Amanita muscaria</b>) being eaten during the coronation
of Montezuma, and in Guatemala stone carvings dating back to 1000
BC depict curious figures with umbrella-like tops resembling the
caps and stalks of an <b>Amanita</b> mushroom.  Mushrooms are also
depicted in ancient Peruvian vessels and in the <b>Mexican Codices</b>.  One
drawing shows an animal-like messenger from god offering the
sacred <b>Amanita</b> to a ruler seated on a throne.  And a fresco in a
Roman Catholic Church in Plaincouralt (Indre), France depicts
Adam and Eve on either side of a tree of knowledge that is
unequivocally a branched <b>Amanita</b> mushroom.  Some scholars believe that the original story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,
where Alice speaks to a green caterpillar who is seated on a red-
and white-capped mushroom, is actually the interpretation of a
mushroom experience by the author, Rev. C.L. Dodgson of Christ
Church College in Oxford (better known by his pen name of Lewis
Carroll).  Another hallucinogenic &quot;high&quot; that is commonly
depicted in paintings and children's stories is the infamous,
&quot;politically incorrect&quot; picture of a witch flying on a broom--the
effects of a potion made from the deadly alkaloids of several
solanaceous herbs, including jimsonweed (<b>Datura stramonium</b>).</font><p>

<center><a NAME="indoles"></a><h3><font color="#FF0000">New World Mushrooms Containing Natural LSD</font></h3></center><p>
    
<font size="7">A</font><font size="4">ccording to R.E. Schultes and A. Hofmann (<b>Plants of the Gods</b>, 1979), a number of other hallucinogenic mushrooms are used by shamans in Mexico, Central and South America, including the four genera <b>Psilocybe</b>, <b>Paneolus</b>, <b>Conocybe</b> and <b>Stropharia</b>. The exact species selected by different shamans is determined partly by personal preference and partly by the purpose of their use.  Since mushrooms are often seasonal, their regional availability may also be a factor in the selection process.  The Aztecs referred to these mushrooms as &quot;teonanacatl&quot; (flesh of the gods).</font><p>

<font size="7">W</font><font size="4">hen the Spaniards conquered Mexico, they were appalled to find the natives worshipping their deities with the help of inebriating plants.  Although the Spanish conquerers hated and attacked the religious use of all hallucinogens, including &quot;peyotyl&quot; (peyote), &quot;ololiuqui&quot; (morning glory), and &quot;toloache&quot; (<b>Datura</b>), they especially resented the psilocybin mushrooms &quot;teonanacatl.&quot;  In order for the Aztecs to carry on their cultural traditions without persecution, the use of some of these hallucinogens went &quot;underground.&quot;  According to R.E. Schultes (1976), the Aztecs may have tried to protect their real sacred plant (peyote) by convincing the Spaniards that all their teonanacatl were dried mushrooms, when actually many of the &quot;mushrooms&quot; were really the dried, shriveled crowns of a sacred peyote cactus.  The Spaniards first misidentified peyote as a mushroom in the sixteenth century when they stated that the Aztec substance &quot;teonanacatl&quot; and peyote were the same.  It is easy to see how the Spanish authorities could have mistaken the dried crowns or tops (buttons) of peyote cactus for the caps of teonanacatl mushrooms.  The Aztecs may have fooled their conquerers into thinking that these religious plants were mushrooms, while the identity of one of their most spiritual and sacred plants (peyote) was a cactus.  Even in the 1900s, botanists and anthropologists concluded that teonanacatl and peyote were the same drug.  This mistake was perpetuated until 1936 when hallucinogenic mushrooms were rediscovered and definitely linked to early Mexican ceremonies.</font><p>

Psilocin, a dephosphorylated version of psilocybin, is about 10 times stronger.  After ingestion by humans, psilocybin is automatically converted into psilocin.  Most psilocybin-containing mushrooms have only a trace of psilocin.  According to David Aurora (1986), the common psilocibin mushroom of the Pacific coast of North America, <b>Psilocybe cyanescens</b> has a higher concentration of natural psilocin and is appropriately named &quot;potent psilocybe.&quot;  Although two of the most famous species of psilocybin mushrooms are <b>Psilocybe mexicana</b> and <b>Stropharia cubensis</b>, there are literally dozens of other species in the above 4 genera with similar hallucinogenic properties.  In fact, Paul Stamets (<b>Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World</b>, 1996) describes all of the species and includes color photographs.  Like so many LBM's (Little Brown Mushrooms), they are difficult to identify unless you are familiar with mushroom structure and spore taxonomy, and have a good compound microscope at your disposal.  In fact, two deadly look-alike LBM's (<b>Galerina autumnalis</b> and <b>Pholiotina filaris</b>) resemble certain species of <b>Psilocybe</b>.  The small ring on their stems (called an annulus) and rusty brown spores (rather than black spores) are &quot;dead&quot; give aways to avoid these potentially lethal mushrooms.</font><p>

<font size="7">O</font><font size="4">ne of the most amazing stories about naturally-occurring alkaloids in fungi concerns ergot (<b>Claviceps purpurea</b>), a fungus that infects grains of rye and related grasses.  One of the psychoactive components of ergot fungus is the alkaloid ergine (d-lysergic acid amide), better known as natural LSD.  The more potent synthetic LSD, (d-lysergic acid
diethylamide), also known as LSD 25, is one of the most powerful psychoactive drugs known.  LSD 25 was originally synthesized from natural pshchoactive alkaloids in ergot.  According to Lewis and Lewis (1977), it is 4,000 times more powerful than mescaline.  Natural LSD (ergine) is also found in the seeds of two species of Mexican morning glory vines which are still ingested by native Indians in an important medicinal and religious ritual.</font><p>

<font size="7">E</font><font size="4">rgot forms a dark, compact, fungal mass called a sclerotium where the grain would normally develop.  One or several of these pelletlike sclerotia can be seen in an infected grain spike, typically extending out from the bracts (glumes).  When separated from the grain spike, the sclerotia superficially resemble rat droppings (rat pellets).  The sclerotia are the source of the potent alkaloids in <B>Claviceps purpurea</B>.  In late spring, when rye plants are in bloom, the overwintering sclerotia from the previous year's crop produce stalked ascocarps resembling microscopic fungal fruiting bodies.  The head of each ascocarp contains many embedded perithecia.  The perithecia contain numerous saclike asci, each with eight ascospores.  The ascospores infect the young, developing grains (ovaries) of rye plants, eventually replacing them with purplish-black sclerotia.  Because it produces ascospores within saclike asci, <B>Claviceps</B> is placed in the fungal Class Ascomycetes.</font><p>

<font size="7">D</font><font size="4">uring the Middle Ages, tens of thousands of people in Europe were
afflicted with ergotism, a malady characterized by gangrenous
extremities, convulsions, madness and death.  They ate rye bread
infested with ergot fungus containing several peptide 
alkaloids of the ergotamine group (including ergotamine, ergosine and ergocristine) that affect blood vessels.  Since they are potent vasoconstrictors, these alkaloids can cause gangrene if ingested in sufficient dosages.  Known as &quot;St. Anthony's Fire,&quot; ergotism was a dreaded disease in Europe.  Between 990 and 1129, more than 50,000 people died of this disease in France.  The disease became so devastating that in 1093 in southern France the people formed an order to take care of the afflicted, and they chose St. Anthony as their patron saint.  One of the symptons of the disease was an intense burning sensation, hence the name St. Anthony's Fire.  It wasn't until 1597 (500 years after the first epidemic of ergotism) that physicians finally associated this horrendous disease with the ergot on rye.  Another form of ergot poisoning involves severe hallucinations and madness, caused by pschoactive alkaloids in the sclerotia.  [In case you are wondering, another hallucinogenic alkaloid, mescaline, comes from the Mexican peyote cactus (<b>Lophophora williamsii</b>) and the South American San Pedro cactus (<b>Trichocereus pachanoi</b>), and has a chemical structure remarkably similar to the brain neurotransmitter dopamine.  Mescaline and the sacred peyote cactus are discussed in a subsequent section.]  For more information about these alkaloids please refer to the references below, particularly those by Richard E.

The alkaloid ergotamine has been used extensively to relieve migraine headaches through the constriction of blood vessels.  Thousands of pounds of ergot sclerotia are harvested each year from midwestern rye farms, and are used for various prescription drugs.  In 1943 chemist Albert Hofmann was studying ergot fungus, whose nuclei contain lysergic acid.  When he added diethylamide he produced lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as LSD.

fences, trellises and walls with lush green foliage and colorful funnel-shaped blossoms, and form lovely green carpets of dichondra lawn.  Several
vines of this family provide us with valuable and nutritious root crops,
including jicama and sweet potatoes.  [Note:  The common supermarket jicama sold in the U.S. comes from the  leguminous vine <b>Pachyrhizus erosus</b> (Fabaceae) from Mexico and Central America.]  Although the Morning-Glory Family is usually

The seeds from the white-flowered morning glory <b>Turbina corymbosa</b> are called &quot;ololiuqui&quot; (pronounced o-low-lee-oo-key) by native Indians of Mexico, and to this day provide them with an important medicinal and religious ritual in their cultures.  The black, angular seeds from the pink-flowered <b>Ipomoea tricolor</b> are called &quot;tlitliltzin.&quot;  An intoxicating drink made from the ground seeds of these species is administered by a shaman and is used by a number of different tribes for the devine recovery of illness.

Because of the similar, trumpet-shaped (funnel-shaped) blossoms, the plant was thought to be <b>Datura</b>, a known hallucinogen still used in Mexico.  Finally in the 1930s, the seeds were clearly linked to species of morning glories.</font><p>

<center><a NAME="Locoweed"></a><h3><font color="#FF0000">Locoweeds:  Wild And Crazy Plants</font></h3></center><p>

<font size="7">U</font><font size="4">nlike the previous mind-altering plants, the next group to be discussed are not taken as drugs plants.  If ingested they can cause serious and
permanent damage to the central nervous system.  Nonetheless, their
poisonous effects on unfortunate herbivores is quite fascinating and may
lead to a better understanding of certain human genetic disorders.  These
plants are most commonly associated with abnormal behavior in livestock and
other range animals, and are often referred to as locoweeds.  They belong
to the large and diverse genus of flowering plants, <b>Astragalus</b>.  A few
western locoweeds also belong to the closely related genus, <b>Oxytropis</b>. 
Literally hundreds of different species of locoweeds grow in almost every
conceivable habitat, from coastal bluffs, grasslands and deep desert
canyons to sun-baked sand dunes and rocky alpine summits.  In fact, 
<b>Astragalus</b> is one of the largest genera of flowering plants with
approximately 2,000 different species in the northern hemisphere.  Just
trying to identify all the different kinds of locoweeds in the western
states can be truly overwhelming.  Although most North American species are
poisonous, several kinds were apparently eaten by native Americans and some
are actually good forage plants.</font><p>

<font size="7">L</font><font size="4">ocoweeds belong to the enormous legume family (Fabaceae), along with beans, peas, clover, alfalfa and more than 15,000 other related species.  They are sometimes called milk vetches from the notion that milk secretion in goats was increased when they fed on the common Old World forage species (<b>Astragalus cicer</b>).  Like many legumes, the leaves are typically divided
into a dozen or more leaflets, and the flowers resemble small pea blossoms. 
Some species produce inflated seed pods that make a distinct popping sound
if you step on them.  Locoweeds are also called rattleweed because of the
bladder-like, inflated pods, particularly when a gust of wind rattles the
seeds inside.  <b>Astragalus</b> is derived from a Greek word meaning anklebone,
the plural of which means dice.  Perhaps the dice connotation refers to the
rattling of seeds inside papery pods, like the sound of dice in a thrower. 
In anatomy, the astragalus or talus is one of seven bones in the ankle
joint.  Anklebones were apparently used for dice by ancient Greeks, and to
this day, veteran crapshooters in Las Vegas refer to dice as &quot;bones.&quot; 
Since adult astragalus bones are a little too large for dice, some of the
smaller, cuboidal or cuneiform anklebones were probably used.</font><p>

<center><img src="images/ankljnt1.gif" WIDTH="574" HEIGHT="288"></center><p>

<font size="7">M</font><font size="4">any species of locoweeds native to the western United States are known to be poisonous to livestock (L.F. James, <b>Noxious Range Weeds</b>, 1991).  The actual mechanism of locoweed poisoning may involve: (1) Toxic levels of selenium absorbed from the soil, (2) nitrogen-containing sugar compounds called nitroglycosides, and (3) potent swainsonine alkaloids causing a condition called &quot;locoism.&quot;  According to P.R. Cheeke and L.R. Shull (<b>Natural Toxicants in Feeds and Poisonous Plants</b>, 1985), of the 372 species of <b>Astragalus</b> in North America, about 25 species contain toxic levels of selenium, 263 contain poisonous nitroglycosides, and 13 cause locoism.  Some of the
poisonous species may be placed in more than one of the above three
categories.  Bee keepers in Nevada have reported serious honey bee losses after working the flowers of spotted locoweed (<b>Astragalus lentiginosus</b>).  The toxicity of <b>Astragalus</b> to bees is unusual because relatively few plants produce nectar or pollen which is poisonous to honey bees.  The notoriously toxic &quot;diablo locoweed&quot; (<b>A. oxyphysus</b>) is well-known in California and some ranchers have attempted to eradicate it from their property.  Apparently it wasn't removed from all grazing land because several years ago the editor of <b>WAYNE'S WORDï¿½</b> observed a deceased steer lying in a pasture containing this locoweed in Kern County.</font><p>

<font size="7">S</font><font size="4">ome species of <b>Astragalus</b> accumulate toxic levels of selenium and often have a peculiar malodorous foliage.  In fact, specimens of <b>A. bisulcatus</b> and the desert species <b>A. crotalariae</b> can produce the dominant scent in herbarium cabinets for many years.  Locoweed indicators of
selenium-rich soils are sometimes referred to as &quot;poison vetches,&quot; and may
contain selenium levels of several hundred to 10,000 ppm (parts per
million) (P.R. Cheeke and L.R. Shull, 1985).  Several names have been applied to
selenium poisoning in cattle, including &quot;blind staggers&quot; and &quot;alkali
disease.&quot;  In severe cases, the animals become lame and emaciated, and
often fall into a kneeling position from which they are unable to rise.  Toxic levels of selenium also occur in other wild plants of western North America, such as species of <B>Stanleya</B>, colorful shrubby perennials in the mustard family (Brassicaceae).  
Selenium poisoning of fish and waterfowl from has been well documented in
California's Central Valley.  In the human body, the trace element selenium
is needed for the function of certain enzymes, and may serve as a cellular
antioxidant thought to suppress certain tumors (M.A. Weiner and J.A. Weiner, <b>Herbs That Heal</b>, 1994).  Natural sources of selenium come from the allium vegetables, including onions and garlic.</font><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he majority of locoweed species poisonous to livestock contain toxic nitroglycosides.  The extreme toxicity of nitroglycosides, such as
miserotoxin, in livestock is caused by the production 3-nitropropionic acid
(NPA) through a complex metabolic pathway involving enzymes of rumen
microbes and the liver (W. Majak and M.A. Pass, <b>Toxicants of Plant Origin </b>, 1989).  Another toxic reaction involves the oxidation of hemoglobin by nitrites produced by the hydrolysis of miserotoxin.  The oxidized hemoglobin (called methemoglobin) is incapable of carrying oxygen.   NPA is lethal to animals because it
inhibits the vital enzyme succinate dehydrogenase inside mitochondria, thus
blocking ATP synthesis and ultimately causing cellular death (M.A. Pass, <b>Plant-Associated Toxins</b>, 1994).  In some animals with different gastrointestinal microbes, such as rats and rabbits, the miserotoxin is not converted into lethal NPA; however, studies indicate that death in rabbits is due to nitrite poisoning (W. Majak and M.A. Pass, 1989).  Symptoms of acute livestock poisoning involve general weakness and loss of neural control, convulsions, blindness, coma, and death.  More than 200 species of <b>Astragalus</b> in North America contain nitroglycosides, including <b>A. cibaria</b>, <b>A. falcatus</b>, and <b>A. miser</b>.  The latter species has also been known to cause high mortality in foraging honey bees.</font><p>

<font size="7">O</font><font size="4">ne of the most destructive types of livestock poisoning by locoweed ingestion is called &quot;loco disease&quot; or locoism.  It is caused by at least two very potent indolizidine alkaloids, swainsonine and swainsonine-N-oxide, and impels horses and cattle to act in a wild and crazy manner.  Some authorities only apply the term &quot;locoweed&quot; to species of <b>Astragalus</b> and <b>Oxytropis</b> containing these alkaloids, such as <b>A. lentiginosus</b>, <b>A. mollissimus</b>, <b>A. wootonii</b>, <b>O. lambertii</b>, and <b>O. sericea</b>.  Swainsonine was originally isolated from the Australian darling pea (<b>Swainsona</b>) and more recently from the spotted locoweed (<b>Astragalus lentiginosus</b>) (R.J. Molyneux and L.F. James, <b>Loco Intoxication: Indolizidine Alkaloids of Spotted Locoweed</b>, 1981).  Consumption of locoweeds for two weeks to a month is necessary before obvious signs of poisoning are evident (L.F. James and K.E. Painter, <b>Locoweed Poisoning in Livestock</b>, 1989).   Animals suffering from locoism may exhibit depression, a staggering gait, and general muscular incoordination.  They may withdraw from other animals and become solitary.  The final stages are characterized by difficulty in eating or drinking, paralysis and death.  Afflicted animals often become nervous, or easily aggravated, and exhibit a complete loss of depth perception.  There are reports of animals being injured or killed by running through fences or falling into ponds and streams.  When plenty of other forage is available, animals tend to avoid locoweed; however, poisoned animals apparently acquire a taste for it and actually seek it out (P.R. Cheeke and L.R. Shull, 1985).</font><p>

<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he cause of locoism at the cellular level is very complex.  The swainsonine alkaloids inhibit or tie up the key enzyme mannosidase
resulting in the accumulation of mannose sugar in nerve cells and
irreparable damage to brain tissue (P.R. Dorling, C.R. Huxtable and P. Vogel, <b>Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology</b>, 1978).  This condition is remarkably similar to a genetic deficiency of the same vital enzyme in humans called mannosidosis (P.A. Ockermann, <b>Mannosidosis</b>, 1973).  Mannosidosis
is a genetic disorder called a lysosomal storage disease, in which cells of
the central nervous system become filled with cytoplasmic vacuoles of
mannose due to the lack of the vital enzyme mannosidase that is essential
in breaking down mannose.  The actual vacuoles are swollen organelles
called lysosomes where the enzymatic breakdown process normally occurs. 
Lysosomal storage diseases, such as mannosidosis, are often caused by
recessive genes and result in paralysis and death within a few years
following birth.  Perhaps one of the better known storage diseases is Tay
Sachs Disease, in which nerve cells fill up with a lipid called ganglioside
or GM2 because they lack the vital enzyme HEX A needed to break down GM2. 
Studies of the biochemical effects of locoweed poisoning on the central
nervous system of cattle may lead to a better understanding of these tragic
human neurological disorders.</font><p>

<font size="7">N</font><font size="4">ative American Indians were apparently aware of the poisonous properties of some locoweeds and avoided them.  Other drug plants are occasionally called locoweeds, such as the hallucinogenic jimsonweed (<b>Datura</b>), and some of these were commonly utilized by Indians during ceremonial rituals.  In the southwest, Cahuilla Indians utilized the pods of at least one unknown <b>Astragalus</b> locoweed (J.L. Bean and K.S. Saubel, <b>Temalpakh: Cahuilla Indian Knowledge and Usage of Plants</b>, 1972).  The pods were pounded up and mixed with beans and other foods, perhaps as a spice or flavor enhancer. 
An Arizona locoweed (<b>A. ceramicus</b>), with beautiful brown-mottled pods,
produces sweet, edible rootstocks which are reportedly eaten in spring by
Hopi children.  Another locoweed of the prairie and plains states (<b>A. crassicarpus</b>) produces edible fleshy pods (K. Kindscher, <b>Edible Wild Plants of the Prairie:  An Ethnobotanical Guide</b>, 1987).  It is known locally as ground plum, Indian pea, or buffalo bean, and the pods were eaten, raw or cooked, by Indians and white settlers.  The perennial roots of three species, including
<b>A. canadensis</b>, <b>A. caryocarpus</b>, and <b>A. pictus-filifolius</b>, were eaten raw or cooked by Blackfoot Indians of Montana and Hopi of Arizona.  Not all
locoweeds are poisonous to people; however, because of the difficulty in
identifying some species, it would definitely <b>NOT</b> be advisable to try any of them in gourmet dishes.  It would actually be easier to select edible mushrooms
from the deadly species, especially with all of the pictorial mushroom
guides available today.</font><p>

<center><a NAME="Peyote"></a><h3><font color="#FF0000">The Mescal Bean And Peyote Cactus</font></h3></center><p>

<font size="7">P</font><font size="4">robably the most famous New World hallucinogenic plant is peyote (<b>Lophophora williamsii</b>), a small, spineless cactus native to the Rio Grande valley of Texas and the northern and central parts of the Mexican plateau region.  Another species (<b>L. diffusa</b>) is native to the Mexican state of Queretaro.  The rounded, gray-green stem crown (top) is radially-divided into sections, each bearing a small meristematic region (called an areole) from which arises a tuft of hairs.  The crown tapers into a thick carrot-like root that extends into the ground.</font><p>

<font size="7">C</font><font size="4">alled &quot;peyotyl&quot; by the Aztecs, this was truly a sacred plant used in religious ceremonies where they communicated with their gods.  The spiritual, religious usage of peyote persists to this day by the Tarahumara, Huichol and other Mexican Indians, as well as by members of the Native American Church in the United States and western Canada.  The Indians cut off the crowns and sun-dry them into brown, mushroom-shaped &quot;mescal buttons&quot; that last for long periods and can be shipped to distant places for use.  After the crown (button) dries, the soft, fleshy tissue is reduced in volume.  For this reason the tufts of hairs appear much larger and occupy a larger proportion of the button.  The Aztec word peyotyl means &quot;caterpillar cocoon,&quot; referring to the white, woolly tufts of hairs.  When the top is severed, the plant often resprouts with new crowns so that many-crowned peyote plants are common.  Except for the woolly hairs, the dried, peyote buttons superficially resemble the cap of a dried mushroom.</font><p>

<font size="7">S</font><font size="4">panish conquerers tried to ban the use of peyote by native Indians.  By 1720 the eating of peyote was prohibited throughout Mexico, but peyote was so strongly rooted in native Indian lore that its use actually spread to other tribes.  The Spanish thought the peyote buttons used by Aztecs were mushrooms, and it wasn't until the 1930s that researchers finally discovered that the Aztecs were actually using both peyote (peyotyl) and psilocybin mushrooms (teonanacatl) in their religious ceremonies.</font><p>
  
<font size="7">T</font><font size="4">he peyote cactus contains more than 50 different alkaloids, but the most active hallucinogen is mescaline.  The chemistry, botany and history of peyote is discussed in a fascinating book by E.F. Anderson (<b>Peyote:  The Divine Cactus</b>, 1976).  Mescaline has a chemical structure similar to the brain neurotransmitter dopamine.  It is also structurally similar to the neurohormone norepinephrine (noradrenalin) and to the stimulant amphetamine.  In the peyote cactus, mescaline is formed in a complex pathway from the amino acid tyrosine.  A similar pathway in humans produces epinephrine (adrenalin) and its demethylated precursor norepinephrine from tyrosine.  Dopamine and its precursor L-dopa are also derived from a tyrosine pathway.  The following illustration shows the remarkable molecular similarity between mescaline and dopamine:</font><p>

<a name="dopamin2"></a>

<center><img src="images/dopamin2.gif" WIDTH="395" HEIGHT="105"></center>

<font size="7">M</font><font size="4">escaline also occurs in several other cactus species, including the commonly cultivated, night-blooming, South American San Pedro cactus (<b>Trichocereus pachanoi</b>).  In the Andes of Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia the natives call this tall, columnar cactus &quot;aguacolla&quot; or &quot;giganton.&quot;  An intoxicating drink called &quot;cimora&quot; is made from the boiled stems.  According to R.E. Schultes (1976), the drink may be spiked with other potent hallucinogens, including species of <b>Brugmansia</b> (<b>Datura)</b>.  The cut stems are sometimes seen in market places of the northern Peruvian Andes in neatly stacked piles.  There are about 25 species of <b>Trichocereus</b> native to South America.  They are typically large, tree-like cacti with cylindrical, ribbed stems and large, nocturnal, white blossoms.  Other species within this fascinating genus may also contain mescaline.</font><p>

<font size="7">C</font><font size="4">ontrary to popular rumors, mescaline is not found in the bright red, poisonous seeds of the beautiful, drought-resistant shrub called mescal bean (<b>Sophora secundiflora</b>); however, they do inhabit a similar range in the arid lands of the southwestern United States and Mexico.  Mescaline is also not related to the highly intoxicating beverage called &quot;mescal&quot; or &quot;mezcal,&quot; made from the fermented and distilled juices of several North American species of <b>Agave</b>, including <b>A. americana</b> and <b>A. atrovirens</b>.  Incidentally, the fermented juice is called pulque, and the highly-alcoholic distilled products include mezcal and tequila.  The seeds of mescal bean contain another potent and dangerously poisonous alkaloid, cytisine, which was ingested by some North American Indian tribes in a vision-seeking &quot;Red Bean Dance&quot; prior to the widespread use of peyote.  According to R.E. Schultes (1976) mescal beans have been discovered in Indian sites dating before AD 1000, and from one site dating back to 1500 BC.  In fact, to this day the leader of the peyote ceremony in some of these tribes (called the &quot;roadman&quot;) wears a necklace made from bright red mescal beans.  [For biology students, cytisine is not to be confused with the pyrimidine base cytosine found in DNA and RNA.]</font><p>

<font size="7">O</font><font size="4">ne of the most interesting stories concerning the use of peyote north of Mexico concerns Quanah Parker, son of a Comanche war chief (Nokoni) and Cynthia Parker (a white woman who was captured by the Indians).  [For more information about this remarkable man, please refer to B. Neeley (1995) <b>The Last Comanche Chief:  The Life and Times Of Quanah Parker</b>,  and Weston La Barre (1975) <b>The Peyote Cult</b>.]  In 1884, Quanah Parker became seriously ill and was treated by a Mexican curandera.  Quanah regained his health and recognized that peyote could be a useful factor in binding his people together.  The latter half of the 19th century (post Civil War period) was a time of turmoil and humiliation for the American Indian tribes.  Their pristine hunting lands were gradually being taken away from them; they were swindled by federal authorities; they were forced to move to reservations far from their homes; they were forced to attend schools that denied their heritage; they were corrupted by the white man's &quot;firewater&quot; (alcohol); and they had Christianity forced upon them by missionaries.  Quanah fashioned a series of ceremonies, with cultural elements from Comanche, Kiowa, Apache, and parts of Christianity.  This was a good time for the peyote religion--to bring native people dignity and hope of survival, and to bring them spiritual sustenance.  The peyote religion spread rapidly during the late 1800s and early 1900s.  With the assistance of James Mooney, an ethnologist with the Smithsonian Institution, the Native American Church was finally established in 1918.  According to Benjamin Capps (<b>The Great Chiefs</b>, 1975), Quanah Parker once said to a white listener:<b> &quot;The white man goes into his church house and talks about Jesus; the Indian goes into his teepee and talks to Jesus.&quot;</b></font><p>
