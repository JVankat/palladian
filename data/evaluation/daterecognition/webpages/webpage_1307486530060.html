            <h2>The name Rockefeller is not much in the public debate. If they
            are so influential, why don&#8217;t we see more of them in public?</h2>
            <p> In some areas of the world the rulers are still visible and honored
              by their people with their pictures being present everywhere. The
              most powerful people in the world choose another avenue. They exert
              their powers clandestinely and they hate the public eye. The Rockefeller
              group controls more than 200 pharmaceutical companies, large and
              small, without anyone talking publicly about it. The Rockefeller
              group is behind some of the most influential financial institutions
              in the world including Chase Manhattan Bank and others. The Rockefeller
              group, of course, owns the Exxon consortium and other multinational
              petrochemical companies. The annual revenues of Exxon alone surpass
              the sum of the gross national product of half of the countries
              on earth. </p>
            <p> The Rockefeller consortium also controls the media, including
              Time Warner, CNN and an entire network of newspapers, radio- and
              TV-stations.
              Thus, it is no surprise that US public opinion could be manipulated
              to the point that many innocent people were misled to support such
              illegal actions as a war against any international law. And those
              who were in doubt were further manipulated by paid &#8216;opinion
              polls&#8217;, the results of which were openly questioned in the
              New York Times and elsewhere.</p>
            <p> The counterpart of the Rockefeller group in the US is the Rothschild
                group in Great Britain with controlling investments in the drug
                industry of the <a href="../PHARMACEUTICAL_BUSINESS/pharmaceutical_industry.htm">second
                largest export nation of pharmaceutical products</a>. </p>            
            <h2>Are you suggesting that governments of the world should file complaints
              with the International Criminal Court in The Hague against George
              Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and others?</h2>
                <p> Absolutely yes! The world community has long worked for establishing
                this court that was set up to prosecute violations of international
                law, especially war crimes committed in wars that were started
                or conducted without any international legitimization. When,
                  if not now, is there a situation where those who started the
                  war against
                Iraq and are about to bring conflicts to other countries have
                  to be brought to justice? If they are not stopped now, they
                  will continue
                harassing the people of the world, endangering the lives of the
                people and risking dragging down planet earth in their own demise.
                Again, the people of the world have to understand that the <a href="../PHARMACEUTICAL_BUSINESS/laws_of_the_pharmaceutical_industry.htm">pharmaceutical
                industry</a>, the <a href="../PHARMACEUTICAL_BUSINESS/health_movement_against_codex/health_movement05.htm">largest
                investment industry on planet earth</a>, is
                  doomed. It will disappear - the only question is when. Secondly,
                  there
                is no question that those who are responsible for having conducted
                this unscrupulous business with disease and have had to justify
                the unnecessary and premature death of millions of people are
                doomed with them. Do you think that they will give up voluntarily? </p>
                <p> The people of the world and their elected governments have
                  to wake up to this situation. The Bush Administration openly
                  propagates
                  the escalation to a new world war. And they will do it, unless
                  the people of the world stop them. Since they cannot be stopped
                  militarily without risking a world war, they need to be stopped
                  with two other means available: economic and political means. </p>
                <p> The economic means are a blockade of the pharmaceutical business
                    with disease by refocusing the national health care systems
                    of nations worldwide on natural health and by refusing to
                  pay the
                    patent fees on a small amount of pharmaceutical drugs that
                    may still be needed - for example antibiotics. </p>
                <p> The political means are legally important and must be tackled
                      without delay. The people of the world have to force their
                      governments to start formal proceedings against the Bush
                      and Blair administrations
                      for committing war crimes and violations of human rights.
                      The Court
                      for these violations to be brought to and dealt with is
                  the <a href="world_court_war_crimes.htm">International Criminal
                  Court in The Hague</a>, The Netherlands.</p>
                <p> A complaint needs to be filed for starting and conducting
                        a war against any international law, for mass murder,
                  exploitation, plundering of public and private property and
                  other crimes
                        against
                        humanity
                        and violations of international law. If we, the people
                        of the
                        world, and the governments of 180 countries will let
                  Bush and Blair and
                        the Rockefeller Cartel and the <a href="trilateral_members.htm">members
                        of the Trilateral Commission</a> get away with terrorizing the world with illegal
                        wars - without
                        holding them responsible - then the United Nations, all
                        its legal framework of International Law and the entire
                        UN Court
                        System
                        is worth nothing any longer.</p>
                <p> It is not enough that just the government or corporations
                          are named as defendants. The individual members of
                  the government, George
                          Bush, Condolezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, John Ashcroft
                          and all
                          the others have to be named personally. Tommy Franks
                          and the generals
                          conducting this war without any international mandate
                          have to be named personally. All members of the Rockefeller-Group,
                          the
                          Trilateral
                          Commission and other bodies yet to be identified who
                          instigated,
                          promoted, or benefited economically from the plundering
                          of foreign countries have to be named personally. The
                          same goes
                          for the
                          British side. Not only the Blair Administration, but
                          also the heads of
                          the Rothschild Banks and other direct and indirect
                  profiteers from this illegal war must be exposed. This list
                  must
                          comprise bankers,
                          politicians and other corporate executives, whether
                  they are from the US, from Europe or from anywhere around
                          the world. </p>
                <p> Another complaint has to be filed against the heads
                            of the pharmaceutical industry for the crimes they
                            have
                            been committing
                            on behalf of
                            the pharmaceutical investment industry against the
                            people and the governments of the world. All of that
                            has to
                            happen without
                            delay. </p>
                <p> Most important is the support of the people of the
                              world for their governments to take these actions.
                              I call upon
                              every
                              single person
                              on planet earth to take action to push your own
                  government to file a formal complaint against these interest
                              groups.</p>
                <p> Either we, the people, allow these forces to bring
                                our planet into an abyss, or we take control
                  now. Of course,
                                we the
                                people, may
                                have to drag our governments along to initiate
                                a formal complaint in The Hague. Governments
                  are slow
                                and easily
                                intimidated,
                                especially when someone carries a large economic
                                stick. But we are the people.
                                Can we do it? Of course! And the people of the
                                world have to unite in this endeavor.</p>
                <p> We have to realize: the exposure alone of these
                                  interest groups behind the war efforts is the
                                  single most
                                  important step to
                                  prevent another world war. The world can simply
                                  not afford another war
                                  like the Iraq war, with every day bringing
                  the risk of an outbreak of world war three. The time
                                  to act
                                  is now.
                                  Every
                                  responsible
                                  politician, every citizen of planet earth needs
                                  to realize this historic opportunity
                                  and act immediately.</p>            <h2>What can the people do?</h2>
                                  <p> Everyone should familiarize themselves
                                    with the <a href="../NHC/10_corner_stones.htm">breakthroughs
                                    in the area of natural health</a>. Everyone, no matter whether you live
                in New Deli, Cairo, Johannesburg, New York, Buenos Aires or Mexico
                city, no matter whether you live in a developing country or an
                industrialized country, should inform themselves about the breakthroughs
                in natural health that can effectively and immediately replace
                more than 80% of current pharmaceutical prescription drugs. With
                further research in the area of natural health I estimate that
                within the next years 95% of pharmaceutical drugs will be rendered
              redundant. </p>
                                  <p> That means that the people of the world
                                    have the possibility to take away 95% of
                                    the revenues the pharmaceutical cartel uses
                to
              finance the continuation of its unscrupulous business with disease
              and to continue supporting politicians like Tony Blair and George
              Bush in their election campaigns. Think about that! What a great
              opportunity for everyone immediately to make a contribution not
              only to a healthier world but also to guarantee peace for the future
              of this generation and for the generations of our children and
              grandchildren. </p>
                                  <p> In addition, you need to organize local
                                    support groups to bring your governments
                                    to file an official complaint in The Hague
                                    and
              in other courts, to bring those to justice who are behind the current
              world crisis and who benefit from it. Bringing these forces and
              their actions to the daylight is a precondition to diminish their
              future influence and prevent further damage from these interest
              groups to our planet and its people. </p>
                                  <p> I&#8217;m often asked why have we not heard or seen the pharmaceutical
              interests behind this current war scenario before? The answer is
              very simple. These interest groups are hidden behind an umbrella
              of philanthropy and well doing for this planet. Before understanding
              the unscrupulousness and meanness of the pharmaceutical business
              model you first need to tear down the masquerade of philanthropy
              in order to see the true nature of the unscrupulous investment
              character of the pharmaceutical business with disease. Now that
              this is done, there is no time to be lost. This interview provides
              a strategy for the people of the world and their political representatives
              to take immediate action to preserve our planet and to hand over
              a healthier and more peaceful world to our children.</p>            <h2>How do you see the role of the United Nations in the future?</h2>
              <p> It is not enough for the United Nations to compete with the
                United States for building a government of post war Iraq. Confining
                  the role of the world body to that is nothing short of a capitulation
                  in front of the petrochemical and pharmaceutical cartel and
                its
                political and military operators. This must never happen. </p>
              <p> The United Nations themselves should be the driving force to
                    bring George Bush, Tony Blair and the other violators of
                international law to justice. Imagine what an important step
                it would be for
                  the world body to file such a complaint on behalf of the majority
                  of the general assembly of the United Nations. There is no
                question in my mind that such a decision can be made and will
                be made. </p>
              <p> The United Nations must be protected. But it is not protected
                    by giving in to the interests of the pharmaceutical cartel
                    and trying
                    to compromise with them. The role of the United Nations,
                if it wants to play a role in the future, has to be one of self-confidence
                    and implementation of its own authority. </p>
              <p> No one, no government, not even the most powerful government
                      in the world, must be allowed to ignore the decisions of
                      the United
                      Nations and hope to get away with it. Those who do so,
                must be brought to justice and their motives must be exposed
                to
                      the world.
                      This is the most urgent and most immediate role of the
                United Nations.</p>
              <p> Of course, the same is also true for the sub organizations
                        of the United Nations like the World Health Organization.
                        An immediate
                        process of cleansing away the interests of the pharmaceutical
                        industry
                        has to take place. It can no longer be tolerated that
                the people of the world believe in the World Health Organization
                        as a
                        body protecting their health while the primary agenda
                of
                        the WHO has
                        long ago become an instrument of the pharmaceutical interests.
                        This must stop. Exposing the pharmaceutical interests
                as the main benefactor of the current crisis will be an important
                        contribution to also stop the abuse of the World Health
                        Organization and bring
                        it back to its original mission: improving health on
                a
                        global level,
                        particularly in the developing world where this organization
                        is most needed.</p>
