<h1>Drugs and the Law</h1>
<h2> Police powers</h2>
<p><a href="#undercover">Undercover police</a> | <a href="#searches">Searches</a> | <a href="#dogs">Sniffer dogs</a> | <a href="#customs">Personal searches by Customs officers</a> | <a href="#property">Searches of property</a> | <a href="#advice">Getting legal advice</a></p>
<h2><a name="undercover" id="undercover"></a>Undercover police</h2>
<p>Police investigations into drug offences commonly involve the use of undercover officers who either offer a degree of encouragement to people to commit an offence, or participate in criminal activity, or both. There is no substantive defence of entrapment in Australian law (<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1995/66.html">Ridgeway v R [1995] 184 CLR 19</a>).</p>
<p>The fact that drugs are supplied to an undercover police officer who encourages the supplier to break the law is not a mitigating circumstance in sentencing (<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWCCA/1999/103.html">R v Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103)</a>.</p>
<p>In Ridgeway, the High Court ruled that although generally evidence obtained by undercover police agents in the course of their participation in a drug importation was admissible, the degree of police involvement in the criminal activity in that particular case was excessive (and so the resulting evidence obtained was inadmissible). <br />
In response to this decision, both NSW and federal governments passed legislation to make otherwise unlawful conduct by police (such as the supply of prohibited drugs) legal, provided it is authorised as part of a controlled operation. </p>
<h2>Police directions in public places</h2>
<p>Police can legally give a 'reasonable direction' to a person in a public place who they believe on reasonable grounds is supplying, or soliciting supply of, or purchasing prohibited drugs. The direction must be 'reasonable in the circumstances for the purpose of stopping' the supply or purchase. It is an offence to fail to comply with the direction without reasonable excuse (<em><a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N">Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</a></em> (NSW), section 197).</p>
<h2><a name="searches" id="searches"></a>Searches</h2>
<p>Police have some powers to search people and property, and seize articles such as drugs for evidence, but their powers are not unlimited. </p>
<p>There are different rules for personal searches, and searches of houses or land.</p>
<h3>Personal searches</h3>
<p>The police can search a person without arresting them under the <em><a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N">Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</a></em>, section 21. This section gives police the power to &quot;stop, search and detain&quot; anyone who they &quot;reasonably suspect&quot; might be in possession of drugs. Police can search a vehicle if they have a similar reasonable suspicion under the <a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N"><em>Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</em></a>, section 36.</p>
<h3>Search after arrest</h3>
<p>The police have the right to search a person after an arrest (<a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N"><em>Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</em></a>, section 23). </p>
<p>A police officer above the rank of sergeant can request that a doctor examine a person in custody (if such an examination is relevant to the charge) without the person's consent.</p>
<p>Women should only be searched by a woman police officer. If no female constable is available, however, the police can request &quot;any female&quot; to conduct the search under their direction.</p>
<div class="highlighted">
<h3>Case study</h3>
<h3>The case of the highway hirer</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2001/797.html">DPP v Leonard [2001] NSWSC 797</a>, the defendant, driving a hire car, was stopped for a random breath test on the Sturt Highway. The police officer told the defendant that it was common for cannabis to be transported in hire cars on that highway, and asked if he could search the car. The defendant said, &quot;Go for it, there's nothing in there&quot;. The police found a traffickable quantity of cannabis in the boot. The magistrate hearing the case found that the police did not have reasonable grounds for suspicion to justify a search and that the defendant's consent was not valid because the police had not informed him that he had a right to refuse consent. </p>
<p>On appeal, the Supreme Court ruled that the consent was valid and therefore the search was legal. The police do not have to advise you that you can refuse. (Interestingly, the Director of Public Prosecutions did not appeal the magistrate's finding that there were no reasonable grounds for the search in the officer's stated reasons.)</p>
</div>
<h2><a name="dogs" id="dogs"></a>Sniffer dogs</h2>
<p>In recent years, police have used specially trained dogs to detect the presence of prohibited drugs. This practice raised questions about whether the activity of sniffer dogs itself amounts to a search. </p>
<p>The situation has been clarified both by legislation and a NSW Supreme Court decision.</p>
<h3>Legislation</h3>
<p>Under section 148 of the <a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N"><em>Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</em></a> police can use sniffer dogs without a warrant to detect illicit drugs, but only for &quot;general drug detection&quot;, defined to mean using a dog to detect the potential presence of drugs by smell, before the police conduct any actual search of the person or their belongings.</p>
<h3>Sniffer dogs and warrants</h3>
<p>Police can use a dog to assist with general drug detection without a warrant <a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N"><em>(Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</em></a>, s 148), in relation to a person who is at, entering or leaving:</p>
<ul><li>premises licensed for the consumption of liquor sold there (not including a restaurant or dining room)</li>
<li>	a public place being used for &quot;a sporting event, concert or other artistic performance, dance party, parade or other entertainment&quot;</li>
<li>	a train, bus or light rail vehicle, on a prescribed route, or a station, platform or stop.</li></ul>
<p>In other circumstances - for example, in a public street - police can only use drug detection dogs to search people or vehicles with a warrant issued under the <a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N"><em>Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</em></a>, section 149.</p>
<p>A police officer is authorised to use a dog for general drug detection only as provided under the Act (<a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N"><em>Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</em></a>, section 147). </p>
<h3>In the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2002/1157.html">DPP v Darby [2002] NSWSC 1157</a> the defendant was searched outside a nightclub after a sniffer dog had indicated to police that he was in possession of prohibited drugs. The court ruled that the sniffer dog's activity did not amount to a search. It found that the dog's reaction was a basis for forming a suspicion by the police, just as information from another officer, or from a member of the public, or an officer's own perceptions (for example, of a strong odour of cannabis) might be a basis for an officer to form a suspicion.</p>
<p>Darby applied a 1998 South Australian Supreme Court decision - <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/sa/SASC/1998/6696.html">Questions of Law Reserved (No. 3 of 1998) (1998) 71 SASR 223</a>, which came to a similar conclusion. In that case, the SA Supreme Court decided that a dog sniffing a suitcase in the luggage compartment of a bus was not conducting a search. Special leave to appeal this decision was refused by the High Court.(<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1989/33.html">Hoare v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 348</a>)</p>
<h3>Ombudsman's report</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ombo.nsw.gov.au/show.asp?id=431">NSW Ombudsman's 2006 report</a> on the introduction of the sniffer dog legislation was that drugs were found in only a quarter of cases where the dogs had indicated the presence of drugs, which suggests that sniffer dog 'indication' may be of doubtful accuracy. The Ombudsman report also found that the use of sniffer dogs had no apparent effect on apprehending drug suppliers, with less than 1% of the over 2000 people found in possession after a search, successfully prosecuted for supply. </p>

<h2><a name="customs" id="customs"></a>Personal searches by customs officers</h2>
<p>People coming into Australia are obliged to answer questions from a customs officer about prohibited drugs. Luggage can be inspected even where there is no reason to suspect that it might contain drugs.</p>
<h3>Types of search </h3>
<p>There are two types of personal searches available under the Customs Act in relation to a person suspected of carrying prohibited imports: frisk searches and external searches. </p>
<p>A frisk search is a quick feel of a person's outer garments, including any clothing voluntarily removed. An external search involves a search of a person's body (but not body cavities) and any of their clothing.</p>
<p>If a person refuses a frisk or an external search, the customs or police officer may apply to a specially authorised customs officer or a magistrate for an order that an external search be made.</p>
<h3>Detention and search</h3>
<p>If a customs or police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that a person is carrying prohibited imports, they may be detained and searched. The search must be conducted as soon as practicable by an officer of the same sex, and appropriate arrangements made for privacy. </p>
<h3>If internal concealment is suspected</h3>
<p>People reasonably suspected of internally concealing a suspicious substance may be detained by a customs officer or police officer. The chief executive officer of Customs or a police officer must then seek a detention order (up to 48 hours, but renewable) from a judge or magistrate. </p>
<p>If the person detained does not consent to an internal search, the customs or police officer must apply to a judge for an order for a medical practitioner to carry out the search.</p>

<h2><a name="property" id="property"></a>Searches of property</h2>
<p>To enter a person's home or any other private property without the invitation or consent of an occupier, the police must have a search warrant (except in emergency situations such as chasing an escaping suspect, or where there is apparently an assault occurring on the premises). To obtain a search warrant, the police must swear on oath to an authorised officer that they have reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed on those premises, and the basis of that suspicion (<a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N"><em>Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</em></a>, sections 47 &amp; 48). </p>
<h3>When police are at the premises</h3>
<p>When police go to premises with a search warrant they must produce an occupier's notice, otherwise they do not have the right to enter the premises.</p>
<p>It is an offence to obstruct or delay police entry, or give an alarm. It is an offence to resist a police officer who appears at their door with a search warrant ( s52 <em><a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N">Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</a></em>). </p>
<h3>Police powers with a warrant</h3>
<p>The police can use as much force as is reasonably necessary to conduct the search, which can mean pulling out drawers (and ceilings).</p>
<p>Search warrants also give police the right to search a person found in or on the premises if they have a reasonable suspicion that the person has the thing mentioned in the warrant (<a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N"><em>Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</em></a>, section 50).</p>
<p>With a warrant, police can cross property owned by others, break open doors and windows and do other 'necessary' acts to a property reasonably suspected of being drug premises (<a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+103+2002+cd+0+N"><em>Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002</em></a>, section 141). </p>
<h3>Evidence from illegal searches</h3>
<p>Evidence obtained through illegal police searches (or otherwise illegally or improperly obtained) is admissible, if the magistrate or judge uses their discretion to allow it. The prosecution must establish the desirability of admitting the evidence (<a href="http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+25+1995+cd+0+N"><em>Evidence Act 1995</em></a>, (NSW), section 138).</p>
<h3>Detection by helicopter</h3>
<p>Where a police helicopter detects cannabis plants from the air and police then enter the property without a warrant, the evidence obtained may not be admissible. In <em>Nicholson and Curran</em> (unreported, District Court Inverell, 25 March 1999) the discretion was exercised to not admit evidence of cultivation obtained from such a raid, resulting in the conviction being quashed. In subsequent civil proceedings, the same appellants and 22 of their fellow residents at the Wytaliba community were awarded a total of over $1 million in damages for the police trespass (<em>Curran v Walsh</em>, unreported, District Court, 17 October 2000).</p>
<h3>Writs of assurance and customs warrants</h3>
<p>Wide powers are given to customs officers in possession of a writ of assistance (issued by a Supreme Court judge), and customs and police officers in possession of a customs warrant.</p>
<p>These are general warrants; they last for periods of time and are not confined to the investigation of a specific set of circumstances. Those in possession of these warrants can, at any time, enter and search any premises, including houses, in which drugs may be or are supposed to be. They do not have to show reasonable suspicion, and may use force. </p>
<h3>Seeking the proceeds of crime</h3>
<p>Search warrants can also be issued under the legislation dealing with the confiscation of proceeds of crime. They can, for example, cover documents that can assist in tracking down property that is drug-derived or which belongs to those who are reasonably suspected of drug-related activities.</p>

<h2><a name="advice" id="advice"></a>Getting legal advice</h2>
<p>You may be able to obtain free help (or help at a reduced cost) from:</p>
<ul><li>	LawAccess NSW</li>
<li>	the Legal Aid Commission or Aboriginal Legal Service</li>
<li>a community legal centre.</li></ul>
<h4>LawAccess NSW</h4>
<p>LawAccess NSW is a free government telephone service offering legal information, referral to appropriate free legal services in your area or private solicitors, and in some cases, legal advice. <br />
Tel: 1300 888 529</p>
<h4>Legal Aid</h4>
<p>The Legal Aid Commission provides free legal representation in drug cases if you qualify under the means test. This means test is complicated. Whether you qualify depends on: </p>
<ul><li>	your income</li>
<li>how many dependants you have</li>
<li>	other factors like how much rent you pay. </li></ul>
<p>If you receive a Centrelink pension or benefit, you will usually qualify under the means test. If you don't receive Centrelink payments but you are on a low income, you should apply for legal aid.
