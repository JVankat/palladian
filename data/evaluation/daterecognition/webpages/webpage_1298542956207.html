<P>To students at Auburn in 1919, the overwhelming majority of whom were
men, the Southern belle was &quot;synonymous with flowers and laughter and
sunshine; with gay voices and sparkling eyes; with beauty that is of paradise,
hearts that are angel's own.&quot;(1) Little seemed to have changed since
1860, when planter Daniel R. Hundley described the perfect Alabama woman
as a &quot;true-hearted daughter of the sunny South,&quot; a simple woman
unaffected in manners, pure in speech and soul, and &quot;ever blessed with
an inborn grace and gentleness of spirit lovely to look upon.&quot;(2) The
Southern woman was expected to be quiet, self denying, and soft-spoken,
a paragon of virtue who was protected by her man, be it father, brother,
husband, or son. Antebellum society was male-dominated, fathers were the
heads of their households, and a wife's duty was to obey.(3)</P>

<P>Hundley suggested that a daughter was best taught at home, where she
could learn to be a happy companion for her husband, although wealthy parents
were likely to send their girls to female seminaries. The young ladies who
attended these finishing schools were taught poise and grace, learned how
to sing, play the piano, and draw, and became familiar with poetry and some
classics and simple arithmetic.(4) A few schools offered advanced courses
in botany, French, and algebra.(5) Contemporary educational theory suggested
that higher learning was too taxing for women and could be physically harmful,
perhaps resulting in brain fever.(6) Higher education might make a woman
&quot;harder&quot; and less feminine. In the words of Alabama congressman
Henry W. Hilliard, society expected &quot;to see every man manly, and every
woman womanly.&quot;(7)</P>

<P>When fathers and husbands marched off to defend the South in 1861, they
left these faint-hearted belles behind to cope with plantations and farms,
families and businesses. Most of the women rose to the challenge, and they
managed, some quite well.(8) The widows left with children shouldered even
greater responsibilities. In the post-war South women outnumbered men, and
the years of Reconstruction brought poverty so stifling that it was a decade
before educational reform for females became an issue. Beginning in the
mid-1870s, reformer Julia Tutwiler, known as &quot;Miss Julia,&quot; led
the movement in Alabama to create educational opportunities for women. Her
father, a former professor at the University of Alabama and founder of the
Greene Springs School in Hale County, had allowed young Julia to attend
classes with the boys. After the war she studied at Vassar College in New
York and subsequently attended school in Germany.(9)</P>

<P>Although there were a number of girls' schools in Alabama called colleges,
none offered upper level courses or post-graduate programs.(10) It was no
secret that their usual two-year curricula were not of the same high quality
as those of male institutions, which refused to accept female students.(11)
From her position as co principal of the Alabama Normal College for Girls
in Livingston, which she founded to provide teacher-training for women,
Tutwiler was determined to open higher education in the state to graduates
of her school and to all women on the same terms as it was available to
young men.</P>

<P>Tutwiler focused her attention on the nearby state university at Tuscaloosa.(12)
But it was not to be the University of Alabama that took the lead in bringing
coeducation to the state. The first institution of higher learning in Alabama
to accept female students was the land-grant university, the Agricultural
and Mechanical College, called the Alabama Polytechnic Institute from the
1880s before the name was legally changed in 1899 by the legislature. Whatever
its official name, students always called it Auburn.</P>

<P>Founded in 1856 by the Alabama Methodist Conference as the East Alabama
Male College, the liberal arts school opened in 1859, closed during the
Civil War, and reopened in 1866.(13) For years it struggled financially.
Times were hard during the Reconstruction era, and the Methodist Church
was especially destitute.(14) Only determined support from the village of
Auburn and dedicated leadership from the trustees, president, and faculty
kept the college operating. In 1856 the Methodists also founded a female
college at Tuskegee, perhaps to separate the sexes by geographical distance.
Later this school was moved to Montgomery and became Huntingdon College.</P>

<P>During the 1867 constitutional convention, a Limestone County delegate
introduced an amendment that Alabama take advantage of the 1862 Morrill
Land Grant College Act to establish an agricultural and mechanical college
in the state, perhaps as &quot;a branch&quot; of the University of Alabama.
The federal act stipulated that no funds from land grants could be used
for construction of buildings, and since the state had no money, it was
necessary to find an existing campus to turn into the land-grant college.
Most of the impoverished denominational schools, as well as the state university,
proposed their college as the site for the A. &amp; M. Institution. Even
Colonel James R. Powell, the president of the Elyton Land Company, jumped
into the fray, offering fifteen acres, a drill field, thirty acres for an
experimental farm, buildings in Birmingham, and $20,000.(15)</P>

<P>The contest to establish the land-grant college was a prime example of
Reconstruction politics that, historian Walter L. Fleming reported, included
bribes and vote buying.(16) After parliamentary maneuvering that lasted
for days and involved racial issues and sectional politics, Auburn was chosen.
On February 24, 1872, the legislature established the state land-grant school
in east Alabama and accepted the gift of the Auburn campus from the Methodist
Church and 200 acres from the citizens of Auburn.(17) The real hero of the
legislative battle was Lee County's representative in the House, Sheldon
Toomer. Although seriously ill, he stayed on the floor and directed the
fight. Toomer died in March, leaving a young son who two decades later would
graduate in pharmacy from the college his father had helped create. With
his stepfather, young Shel Toomer established a drugstore at the corner
of Main (now College Street) and Magnolia in the late 1890s.(18)</P>

<P>The A. &amp; M. College struggled financially, in part because Alabama
was the only state in the Union that did not supplement the interest funds
received from the land-grant endowment for its land-grant college, although
the legislature had mandated that two boys per county be allowed to attend
the college tuition free.(19) In fact, it was 11 years before the state
finally appropriated $30,000 to repair and construct buildings. (20)</P>

<P>Despite its financial problems, the agricultural and mechanical college
attracted a competent and dedicated faculty. Student enrollment increased
to 279 in 1879, and each fall the Western Railway dropped off more young
men at Auburn. Some arrived directly from Montgomery, while some changed
trains in Opelika and rode the &quot;dummy,&quot; a little engine with one
car and the butt of cadet jokes, to Auburn. Drays met the students at the
tracks and hauled their trunks up the dusty hill to one of the many homes
that offered room and board to the boys. The college had no dormitories,
and all the young men lived in town, many of them with faculty or with widows
who had moved to Auburn specifically to run boarding houses in order to
support their families.(21)</P>

<P>After arriving, freshman went shopping &quot;uptown&quot;- located on
a knoll higher than the surrounding area, the crossroads at Toomer's corner
was never &quot;downtown.&quot; Auburn had more men's clothiers than a community
so small might require. They catered to the needs of male students and carried
a selection of uniforms worn by the cadets. The 1906 A.P.I. uniform cost
$15, came with two pairs of pants, and was worn every day by the students.(22)
Military training was an important part of the land-grant college concept,
and townspeople enjoyed watching formation drills by the cadets.</P>

<P>Auburn was located on land ceded by the Creeks in 1832 and settled by
a group of Methodist families from Georgia. The small village was named
by Lizzie Taylor, who quoted from Oliver Goldsmith's poem &quot;The Deserted
Village,&quot; saying, &quot;Name it Auburn! 'Sweet Auburn, loveliest village
of the plain!'&quot; During the antebellum period Auburn was noted for its
fine academies, especially W. F. Slaton's Male Academy and the Auburn Masonic
Female College (which in 1853 boasted the largest auditorium in east Alabama-a
wooden structure that was moved to the A.P.I. campus in 1883 and became
Langdon Hall).</P>

<P>The commerce of Auburn was supported by area planters who sold a little
cotton, sending it by wagon to one of the nearest navigable rivers. The
Western railroad reached Auburn in 1847 and linked the town to the cotton
markets of Mobile and Atlanta. In 1855 the Montgomery Advertiser testified
to Auburn's healthy climate, &quot;bracing air and excellent water,&quot;
which many Montgomery residents enjoyed when they fled to Auburn during
the yellow fever epidemic of 1854. The town was noted for elegant churches
with large congregations and for a moral tone that would make it an appropriate
community for a Methodist college.(23) The town had a flourishing economy.
There were eight large dry-goods stores, shoe and carriage factories, grocery
stores, a drugstore, a jewelry store, and a cabinetmaker's shop.(24)</P>

<P>When the East Alabama Male College became a land-grant institution in
1872, the board of trustees appointed Isaac Taylor Tichenor president. A
Baptist minister, Tichenor was well known in central Alabama, having served
before the war as pastor of the Montgomery First Baptist Church and as chaplain
to the Seventeenth Alabama regiment at the battle of Shiloh. Tichenor was
entrusted with the responsibility of integrating the agricultural and engineering
curriculum into the liberal arts curriculum. But his primary chore was keeping
the college operating without adequate funds from the state. The college
received &quot;$20,280 in depreciated money as interest on Auburn's land-grant
endowment,&quot; but the principal &quot;had been lost in the reckless financing
of the Reconstruction years.&quot;(25)</P>

<P>In an important signal of change to come, on July 12, 1875, President
Tichenor reported to the board of trustees that the Auburn faculty had passed
a resolution requesting that the board &quot;give young ladies the privilege
of becoming students of the college.&quot; Tichenor noted that only one
faculty member opposed the measure and that it &quot;meets with very hearty
approval.&quot; But the board took no action.(26)</P>

<P>Two years later in his annual report, Tichenor reminded the trustees
of the faculty's request &quot;to open the regular college classes to females&quot;
and stated that the faculty's opinion &quot;has undergone no change.&quot;
The next day, June 26, 1877, during the trustees' meeting, the committee
on the course of study recommended that the question of female admission,
which it had carefully considered, &quot;be deferred until the next meeting
of the Board.&quot;(27) Although Tichenor was the father of five daughters
by his four marriages, he was not enthusiastic about coeducation. Nevertheless,
he recognized that it would bring more money to the college.(28) Still,
it would be 15 years before the admission of women to the A. &amp; M. College
was discussed formally by the board. By that time, the prevailing opinions
in Alabama on the issues of higher education for women and coeducation were
beginning to change.</P>

<P>College education for American women began in women's seminaries in the
North and Midwest during the first half of the nineteenth century. Coeducation
was established at Oberlin College in 1833, and many colleges adopted it
during the Civil War. When enrollment dropped, as students volunteered or
were conscripted, many Northern universities admitted women, while the general
egalitarian philosophy of the Western states encouraged gender equality.
In the South, colleges were closed during the war, and many campuses were
converted into hospitals for wounded Confederate soldiers.(29) After the
war the South's poverty, traditional conservatism, and attitudes toward
women prevented the development of coeducation. In 1871 the University of
Arkansas became the first Southern state university to admit women,(30)
but Alabama supported no institution where females could receive a college
education until 1882, when the legislature gave Julia Tutwiler $2,500 for
teacher-training at her Livingston school.(31)</P>

<P>In the 1880s Tutwiler was working toward two goals: the creation of an
industrial school for girls (which was established in 1892 and eventually
became the Alabama College for Women at Montevallo) and the introduction
of coeducation at the University of Alabama.(32) With &quot;relentless persistence&quot;
she worked to create a favorable public opinion for higher education for
women.(33) One man warned that &quot;you might as well give Miss Julia what
she wants when she first asks for it for it will save time, as she always
gets her way.&quot;(34)</P>

<P>In 1891 Tutwiler presented a paper to the Alabama Education Association
on coeducation and character. She stressed the natural order of families,
that &quot;the loveliest women and the noblest men&quot; she had known were
&quot;in families where brothers and sisters have grown up together-in genial
companionship-sweetening and strengthening each others' lives and characters.&quot;
She noted that in ancient days and biblical times the sexes were together,
but segregation was &quot;inherited from the days when monks and nuns were
the only teachers.&quot; She thought girls were better able to select husbands
after attending coeducational schools and that coeducation would &quot;not
harm 'distinctive womanhood.'&quot;(35)</P>

<P>Opponents of coeducation on the national level gave many reasons for
their opposition. Male students would be distracted by having females in
the classroom, and they would be uncomfortable with women on campus. Since
women were thought to be mentally inferior, coeducation would lower the
standards of an institution. Opponents argued that women would also destroy
religious beliefs, promote promiscuous behavior, force a change in the honor
system, and ruin male camaraderie on campus. Coeds would encourage men to
marry early, before they were established in their professions, thus having
a pernicious effect upon the man's career.</P>

<P>College education would make women &quot;inferior housekeepers,&quot;
and advanced education was not needed to make a woman a good wife and mother.(36)
Studying in competition with male students would be detrimental to a woman's
health. One medical doctor claimed that a female needed special times to
rest, especially during her monthly periods when there was &quot;an enormous
increase of nerve waste&quot; and &quot;poison&quot; was retained in her
system and acted upon &quot;the gray matter of the brain frontal lobes.&quot;(37)
In the South opponents particularly stressed that such commingling of the
sexes would destroy &quot;traditional ideals of genteel womanhood&quot;
best nurtured in female seminaries.(38)</P>

<P>But American women-and Southern women-were demanding the same access
to higher education as men. Coeducation was economical, because many states
were too poor to support high-quality institutions for both men and women,
and a sense of justice argued for equal education for both sexes. Novels
and childrearing guidebooks pointed out the stronger moral influence of
the educated mother. Coeducation was &quot;in accord with nature,&quot;
girls would be a &quot;refining influence&quot; on the campus, and boys
would be less inclined to &quot;engage in improprieties if not vices&quot;
should females of high character be their associates in classrooms.(39)
The Morrill Act of 1862 had increased the number of state universities,
and &quot;taxpayers demanded admittance of their daughters as well as their
sons.&quot;(40) In the North the question of the rights of African-Americans
brought to mind the rights of women, while in the South the discussion of
women's rights was suppressed lest the issue of black rights become part
of the dialogue. Nationwide, coeducation increased from 30 percent of educational
institutions in 1870 to 70 percent by 1900.(41) Auburn was at the forefront
of this movement in the South.</P>

<P>In 1882 Dr. William LeRoy Broun (his grandson insists the name is pronounced
broon) became president of the A. &amp; M. College. A Virginia graduate,
he was commandant of the Confederate Arsenal at Richmond and was one of
those brilliant young men associated with Josiah Gorgas and the Confederate
Ordnance department who played significant roles in industrial development
and scientific education in the South after 1865. Broun stayed at Auburn
one year, left in a dispute over curriculum changes to improve the sciences,
then returned in 1884 after his replacement, David F. Boyd, secured approval
of his recommendations.(42)</P>

<P>Broun's leadership at Auburn was his &quot;crowning achievement.&quot;
Ralph B. Draughon pointed to Broun's &quot;greatest genius&quot; as &quot;his
ability to select and bring to the Faculty a remarkable group of young men,
many of whom were destined to shape the institution and guide it for fifty
years after his death&quot; in 1902.(43) President Broun redesigned the
curriculum to strengthen the sciences; established separate departments
of Civil Engineering, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, and Physics;
obtained land for an agricultural experiment station; and convinced the
board of trustees to authorize the faculty to use, in addition to the legal
name of the college, the words &quot;Alabama Polytechnic Institute.&quot;
The trustees approved this on August 27, 1885, but A.P.I. was not made the
legal name of the college until legislative resolution in 1899. Broun also
openly recognized fraternities (1883), which had been operating secretly
since 1878; helped organize the Alumni Association (1893); approved bringing
football to Auburn; and persuaded the board of trustees to allow women to
matriculate.(44)</P>

<P>On June 13, 1892, in his report to the trustees, President Broun noted
that &quot;the question of the advisability of extending the privileges
of the college to young women had been the subject of careful consideration
for several years.&quot; Despite the efforts of Tutwiler in west Alabama,
Broun said that &quot;apparently, at present, there is no demand in our
state for this privilege, still it is a well-known principle that, in matters
of higher education, the supply must precede and create the demand, hence
the initiative must be taken by those in authority.&quot; Perhaps bowing
to the opposition evident on the board and still prevalent in the state,
Broun noted that he was not recommending coeducation, but only that &quot;in
a limited way&quot; the &quot;privilege be given young women, who may be
qualified, to enjoy the advantages of instruction&quot; at Auburn.(45) In
his private discussions with the trustees, Broun must have been convincing
since later that day the board resolved that &quot;young women eighteen
years of age, who are qualified to pursue the studies of the Junior Class,
may be entered as students of the College, under such regulations as the
Faculty may prescribe.&quot;(46) Thus, the land-grant college at Auburn
became the first university in the state to allow women to matriculate.</P>

<P>Behind the Auburn faculty's resolve and Broun's support for coeducation
was a group of determined Auburn girls, especially faculty daughters and
particularly Broun's own precocious daughter Kate Conway Broun. The Auburn
Female Institute, the town public school for girls as well as boys, was
doing a remarkable job of preparing students for higher education, but it
did not offer a true college course of study.(47) The boys could matriculate
at the A. &amp; M. College, but not the girls. A few A. &amp; M. faculty
allowed town girls to sit in on their classes, and this had not been disruptive.
Auburn had actively recruited women for the special summer college courses,
offering classes in chemistry, French, German, and Latin for $10 to $20
a term.(48) The presence of women in summer classes proved no problem.</P>

<P>Times were hard, and Alabama families could ill afford to send their
girls out of state to school. The depression that sent the nation's economy
crashing in 1893 had already affected the South. Auburn professors found
it beyond their means to educate their daughters anywhere but the local
female seminary. Then, too, some mothers were reluctant to have their daughters
travel so far from home, and considering Southern xenophobia of the times,
fathers were no doubt loath to have their belles sent North and taught by
Northern teachers. When Annie White Mell, wife of botany and geology professor
P. H. Mell, talked about the reasons for coeducation at Auburn, she noted
that 400 Southern &quot;young ladies&quot; were enrolled in Northern colleges
in 1892 because their states were not providing quality higher education
for them.(49)</P>

<P>When the trustees' resolution was announced, the Birmingham Age-Herald
congratulated the agricultural and mechanical college for taking this progressive
&quot;step forward.&quot; The paper supported both coeducation at Auburn
and Tutwiler's female industrial college, writing &quot;why can't we have
the privilege of educating our girls at Auburn and at a college of their
own also? We can't have too much education along this line.&quot;(50) The
Montgomery Advertiser bragged that the Auburn laboratories were superior
to those found at either Vassar or Wellesley, challenging that &quot;we
will see whether in Alabama there is any demand among our young women for
the higher scientific or linguistic education.&quot;(51)</P>

<P>On June 23, 1892, the Tuscaloosa Gazette announced that the A. &amp;
M. College trustees &quot;took a long stride forward when they decided to
throw the doors of the college open to young women seeking higher education.
Now the daughters of Alabama will not be compelled to go to other states
to enjoy the privilege of pursuing the higher branches of study such as
are usually pursued by young men. Here in their own state, the opportunity
is now open to them and every advantage will be afforded them in that direction.&quot;(52)</P>

<P>Six days later the University of Alabama board of trustees, aware of
the action taken at Auburn, met in Tuscaloosa. The members had invited Julia
Tutwiler to appear before the board behind closed doors and discuss admitting
women to the university. She made a &quot;strong and eloquent appeal in
behalf of this movement.&quot;(53)</P>

<P>Following her meeting with the trustees, Tutwiler dictated a letter of
appreciation, &quot;in the name of the women of Alabama,&quot; to Auburn
president Broun. She wrote that &quot;it seems to me too good to be true,
that what I have wished and hoped for 20 years has quietly come to pass.&quot;
She attached a copy of her address to the University of Alabama trustees
in which she commented that it was &quot;an obvious injustice&quot; that
&quot;the most stupid boy in Alabama can obtain, at our state university
an education without paying tuition and the most brilliant girl is debarred
from this privilege.&quot; Tutwiler felt that women should not be neglected
because &quot;God has given to men so much more bodily strength and vigor
that they can more easily than women support themselves even when deprived
of the assistance of education.&quot;</P>

<P>Tutwiler charged that when the federal government gave land in 1819 for
the support of a &quot;seminary for the education of the youth of the State&quot;
it did not exclude females, but big brother &quot;grabbed the whole apple,
and the little sister did not even get a bite.&quot; She reminded the University
of Alabama trustees that the A. &amp; M. College at Auburn had already &quot;performed
a tardy but praiseworthy act of justice by at least holding out the apple
to the little sister for a bite,&quot; and she challenged them to follow
Auburn's lead since &quot;Alabama should not be the last to do justice to
her women.&quot; Just before Tutwiler left the trustee meeting, a resolution
supporting her position was introduced but not passed, although the men
privately assured her that the University intended to move in this direction
as soon as &quot;suitable arrangements&quot; might be made.(54)</P>

<P>On the sunny fall morning of September 13, 1892, three young ladies walked
briskly toward Samford Hall (called Old Main Hall until 1929) to take examinations
for admission to the junior class at A.P.I., the agricultural and mechanical
college. Kate Conway Broun led the group, her black hair twisted into a
bun at her neck with her &quot;straight-forward gray eyes&quot; under heavy
brows watching the path before her. Like her companions, Willie Gertrude
Little and Margaret Kate Teague, she wore a long dark skirt and &quot;a
snow-white shirt-waist with high, boned collar and long sleeves puffed at
the top.&quot; Mollie Hollifield recorded that Kate took the girls up the
south steps of Samford Hall and into her father's office. President LeRoy
Broun smiled, aware of the historic nature of the moment.(55)</P>

<P>For some time Kate had been determined to matriculate at Auburn, and
the other two had joined her plea.(56) Willie Little's father was a businessman,
farmer, and mayor of Auburn, while Kate Teague had come to Auburn from Arkansas
after her mother's death to live with her aunt, Mary Teague Hollifield.
Her Uncle Hal had helped prepare her for the examinations. The three girls
were taken to a long room where many young men were taking entrance examinations
for the freshman class. In order not to compete with the female seminaries
of the state and to limit entrance to mature young ladies, A.P.I. had restricted
admittance to those who were qualified to pursue the studies of the junior
class, so it was necessary for the girls to do well on the exams.(57) They
were required to stand examinations in mathematics and either English, History,
or Latin.(58)</P>

<P>The three young women received good marks on their examinations and were
admitted to the junior class. Strict rules excluded women from the campus
except while attending class, but otherwise there were no rules since the
girls all lived at home. They were required when they entered the campus
to walk directly to class and to leave the campus immediately after class
dismissed. No loitering or flirting with the cadets was allowed. Later a
room in Samford Hall was furnished as a study and rest room where girls
could stay between classes.(59)</P>

<P>Auburn male students made no objection to the addition of women to their
classes, and &quot;the general belief is that the association with studious,
ambitious, earnest girls is very beneficial to a youth.&quot;(60) In 1893
President Broun reported to the trustees that coeducation at Auburn had
been &quot;widely published in the state&quot; and recognized it as a movement
in &quot;the spirit of the age.&quot;(61) He noted that all the women who
applied were accepted, and their rank was &quot;with the best students&quot;
and their &quot;influence eminently inspiring and beneficial.&quot; The
Montgomery Advertiser wrote that the girls had proved &quot;their ability
successfully to cope with the best of their male competitors, and in some
instances to obtain the mastery over them.&quot;(62)</P>

<P>The next month at Tuscaloosa, Governor Thomas M. Jones attended the commencement
ceremonies and board of trustees meeting at the University of Alabama, staying
in the presidential mansion as a guest of President Richard C. Jones. He
was accompanied by his daughters and &quot;the popular Miss Lidie Lane of
Auburn.&quot;(63) During the trustees' meeting a resolution to admit women
was introduced that was similar to the one approved the year before at Auburn.(64)</P>

<P>The Birmingham Age-Herald announced on the front page that coeducation
at the state university met with the &quot;unqualified endorsement of the
friends of the institution&quot; and editorially commended women for &quot;emerging
from cloister-like homes&quot; to accept &quot;duties that mean something
more than the sewing circle or the teacup gossip of idle hours.&quot;(65)
The Tuscaloosa News thought coeducation would stimulate &quot;the boys to
increased effort&quot; for &quot;the lords of creation&quot; are &quot;ever
averse to playing second fiddle.&quot;(66) To comments that Southern women
would be &quot;a little slow&quot; to attend &quot;mixed universities,&quot;
the paper noted that it was &quot;high time that we shake off those shackles
of a morbid public sentiment against co-education, which are born of ignorance
and prejudice as well as man's conceit.&quot;(67) Two women enrolled at
the Tuscaloosa campus in the fall of 1893.</P>

<P>In the late nineteenth century, commencement festivities at the Alabama
Polytechnic Institute lasted an entire week, beginning on a Thursday and
ending with graduation the next Wednesday. The town made ready for the influx
of people. Everyone came &quot;to enjoy the gaieties of the season&quot;:
parents, friends, alumni, politicians, and lots of lovely girls who arrived
at the train station with trunks filled with ball gowns. When a few hotels
were finally built in the village, the inns were always crowded to capacity.
Most visitors took rooms in private residences. Normally six passenger trains
stopped at Auburn each day-three northbound and three southbound-but the
Western Railway offered reduced rates and stopped every train passing through
Auburn during the week of commencement. Trains from Montgomery arrived &quot;with
standing room only.&quot;(68)</P>

<P>There were dances every day, sometimes two-a tea dance in the afternoon
and a formal dance in the evening, the senior hop, a German in the gymnasium,
or the junior or sophomore cotillion in the basement of Langdon Hall. At
night fireworks lit up the sky. Sunday brought a commencement sermon and
a Y.M.C.A. address that evening. Afternoons were spent listening to oratorical
contests, debates, or the alumni lecture. The alums also paraded and enjoyed
class reunions and a luncheon at which toasts and tributes to &quot;Old
Auburn&quot; and her &quot;sons&quot; resounded.</P>

<P>The A.P.I. cadets marched in drill competitions reviewed by the governor,
his staff, and prominent leaders of the legislature. Young ladies, their
flower-bedecked hats standing out among the sameness of the cadet uniforms,
wore the colors of their sweethearts' companies, which competed for gold
medals. The board of trustees met during the week, and the events were covered
by state papers whose accounts of the festivities appeared on the front
page the following day.</P>

<P>Commencement week at Auburn in 1894 was the largest graduation week ever
held to that time, and it represented a &quot;new departure&quot; as three
women were awarded &quot;degrees and all honors.&quot; Kate Broun, Willie
Little, and Kate Teague received their diplomas &quot;amid thunderous applause.&quot;(69)
Governor Jones rose from his chair on the dais to congratulate each one.
They had accomplished what many thought impossible, and President Broun
said they did it &quot;with ease.&quot;(70) But it was many years before
Auburn's male commencement speakers learned not to address the &quot;young
men of the graduating class,&quot; as Governor Joseph F. Johnston did in
1897 when Annie Heard and Estelle Whitaker received degrees with their class.(71)</P>

<P>Until the turn of the century Auburn enrolled increasing numbers of female
students, and they represented a greater percent of students than at Tuscaloosa.
For instance, in 1896 Auburn had 13 female students out of a total enrollment
of 361 (3.6 percent) while the University of Alabama enrolled one female
in a total student body of 167 (.6 percent).(72) The number of women enrolled
at Auburn rose to a high of 19 in 1897 and 1898, then declined and held
steady at about 10 until lows of five were recorded in 1908 and 1909.</P>

<P>Yet more women at Auburn did not guarantee them equal treatment. In the
historical section of the 1962 Dean of Women's report for the Auburn University
Self Study, the slow growth in female enrollment at A.P.I. was blamed on
the &quot;little if any recognition in class&quot; that women received &quot;except
to have their names called from the roll.&quot; The tradition was &quot;that
no woman student was ever called on to participate audibly in class room
work&quot; and that &quot;for many years the attitude of townspeople and
college students was one of mere tolerance of coeducation.&quot;(73) This
is substantiated from early coeds like Leland Cooper, who graduated in 1907
and recalled in a 1972 interview that her physics professor would not call
on the girls. The women &quot;just had to attend class and pass the tests.&quot;(74)
When one professor called on Mollie Hollifield Jones, she &quot;burst into
tears&quot; because she did not know the answer, and Annie Terrell Basore
said the professor never again called on a girl. The professors usually
greeted the girls at the classroom door and ushered them to the front seats.(75)</P>

<P>Since Auburn coeds in the early years were all daughters of townspeople
and faculty, including the president's daughter, the notion that coeducation
was merely tolerated seems incorrect. It also does not fit with the contemporary
newspaper accounts and other documentation. The question remains of just
how integrated women were in the life of the college and how crucial a factor
this involvement might have been in a woman's college choice.(76)</P>

<P>A better explanation for the slow growth of coed enrollment might be
found in the lack of a women's dormitory and the limited selection of majors
in areas that could lead to jobs for women. Both these issues were addressed
by the college in the early 1920s. By 1920 Auburn's total enrollment had
increased to 1,075, including 18 women (1.7 percent). By contrast, the University
of Alabama student body numbered 1,661, including 293 women (17.6 percent).
Although there were more women at Tuscaloosa, female students there complained
of &quot;rudeness from the men&quot; and of the lack of university housing
for women and in 1911 wrote a &quot;Declaration of the Rights of a Co-Ed&quot;
for the student newspaper.(77) Auburn coeds were not so uncomfortable on
campus.</P>

<P>Following World War I and during the relatively prosperous years of the
Roaring Twenties, total enrollments at both universities increased, Tuscaloosa's
more than doubling. The 1929 Depression slowed the growth of attendan&Yacute;lleges,
but by 1938 women represented almost 26 percent of the 5,210 students at
the Tuscaloosa state university. It was 1961 before women represented more
than 26 percent of Auburn students (in a total student enrollment of 9,270).
Auburn's high ratio of men to women, especially before 1959, was one of
the college's most attractive features to young women interested in meeting
a future husband and was frequently mentioned by women in reminiscences
of A.P.I. college days.</P>

<P>There were differences in the female students attending the two institutions.
Faculty daughters also attended the University at Tuscaloosa, but coeds
at Alabama were more likely to come from distant hometowns than those attending
A.P.I., who with rare exception came from Auburn, Opelika, and Lee County.(78)
This meant that women who attended Auburn during the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries lived at home and walked to the campus or rode
the train from Opelika, rising early to catch the 6:00 a.m. train for Auburn.</P>

<P>Later as A.P.I. attracted students from a wider area, the women boarded
with families in town just as the boys did, although the homes in which
girls lodged were more carefully selected, and boarding houses were not
mixed by sex. There were no college rules for their behavior because they
were &quot;grown young ladies&quot; who &quot;behaved themselves at home
and elsewhere with dignity and discretion&quot; and needed &quot;no matron.&quot;(79)</P>

<P>10. While not part of this story, it is interesting to note that Judson
College in Marion, Alabama, was founded in 1838 by a group of Baptists who
appointed Milo P. Jewett principal. Jewett resigned in 1855 and returned
to the North, believing his efforts to develop a strong academic course
for girls were frustrated by the Baptist leadership. In the 1860s Jewett
brought his Judson experience with his dreams into a partnership with Matthew
Vassar's money, and together they founded Vassar College in Poughkeepsie,
New York, an institution that soon became the premier women's university
in the nation. See Frances Dew Hamilton and Elizabeth Crabtree Wells, Daughters

where women listed as heads of households with young children have occupations
as &quot;keepers&quot; of boarding or lodging houses. Many of them lived
on Gay Street and on Magnolia Avenue. One example is Kate R. Curtis, age
38 with four children ages 16, 12, 6, and 4. The number of women giving
occupation as &quot;cook in boarding house&quot; is also remarkable.</P>
