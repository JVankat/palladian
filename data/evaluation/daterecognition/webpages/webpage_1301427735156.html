<p>
&lsquo;Sensitive people faced with the prospect of a camera portrait put on a face 
  they think is the one they would like to show the world&hellip;Very often what lies 
  behind the fa&ccedil;ade is rare and more wonderful than the subject knows or dares 
  to believe.&rsquo;
</p></div><!-- BEFORE ACI -->
	<div class="body">
<p>
These words by Irving Penn at the beginning of the exhibition set the scene 
  for some gritty and candid images. The fa&ccedil;ade is gone, we see emotion; 
  confidence, joy, uncertainty, sadness, determination. The characters shine 
  through; his focus on the eyes makes you believe that you can feel empathy 
  with the sitter. 
</p>
<p>
The exhibition starts with an impromptu picture of Giorgio de Chirico and 
  spans seven decades including images from Vogue in the &lsquo;40&rsquo;s to just before 
  his death. He uses very few props, early images just a corner or carpet 
  thrown over boxes or chairs. The atmosphere austere and slightly scruffy 
  prompted different reactions, The Duchess of Windsor cool and confident, 
  Georgia O&rsquo;Keeffe diminishing and uncomfortable. Much of the mood created 
  with clever use of light and shadow, his preference being natural or 
  simulated daylight. 
</p>
<p>
His focus turns more to faces than full length images in the 50&rsquo;s, examples 
  being Richard Burton and Pablo Picasso not forgetting the stunning beauty of 
  Audrey Hepburn. A brave &lsquo;portrait&rsquo; of Saul Steinberg wearing a mask is 
  amongst the 60&rsquo;s selection. Another approach emerged in the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s 
  with some sitters like Arthur Miller being photographed with their eyes 
  closed, Issey Miyake in deep shadow and Woody Allen portraying Charlie 
  Chaplin. The images in this exhibition are timeless and the subjects 
  entrancing. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number nineteen is<strong> Rebecca Ley</strong>
</p>
<p>
Spanning his entire career, what is most apparent from the exhibition of 
  Irving Penn&rsquo;s portraits at the National Portrait Gallery is his unwavering 
  quality and style. Each portrait is shot in black and white, utterly 
  truthful but utterly flattering. With every sitter he manages to coax out 
  their character through the way they interact with the space he has given 
  them in his studio. 
</p>
<p>
Penn allows the subject&rsquo;s nature to show by accentuating an expression or 
  pose; the neutrality of the bare setting leaving the subject nowhere to 
  hide. The result is for some, awkward, but for others it is empowering and 
  only serves to prove self-assuredness. With Penn&rsquo;s unique style, he strips 
  away all the fuss that photographing well known figures tends to elicit; 
  what we are left with is only the simplistic but dynamic method in which 
  Penn exposes the individual nuances of each subject. He so artfully captures 
  Grace Kelly&rsquo;s beauty, Edith Piaf&rsquo;s frailty, Picasso&rsquo;s timidity. 
</p>
<p>
The exhibition seems to be a testament to the character of his work; from the 
  1940s until his last work in 2007, he remains steadfast in his approach, 
  never seduced by a novelty or gimmick. He was a constant in an ever-changing 
  commercial world amongst the growth in importance of celebrity and media. As 
  his career progressed, Penn tended to focus more on the inner subject using 
  an unusually close vantage point. The result is a study of how far a 
  person&rsquo;s character can be shown on their face. Each portrait&rsquo;s brilliance 
  lies not in the subject&rsquo;s celebrity but in their personality and 
  disposition. The collection seems to prove the universality of human 
  character, so much so that from walking around the exhibition the viewer 
  would not feel their portrait to be out of place on the wall, so long as it 
  was rendered through Penn&rsquo;s impeccable and unfaltering lens. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number eighteen is <strong>Lauren Davies</strong>
</p>
<p>
On arrival at the exhibition I was overtaken by an eager visitor exclaiming to 
  the attendant, 'This is my second visit to the exhibition it's simply 
  wonderful!' Penn was said to have been able to capture the very essence of a 
  person, I was even more intrigued to find out how the black and white, 
  silvery grey framed prints running at eye level around the walls could 
  incite such passion in admirers. What had Penn revealed through his camera 
  lens? 
</p>
<p>
He penned his subjects into a corner, photographed his sitters propped up 
  awkwardly by chairs obscured by stiff rolls of carpet, choosing to capture 
  people in the stark light of day, refusing to clean the floor of his studio 
  for celebrities. 
</p>
<p>
Known for his images of the Vogue fashion community the display seems at first 
  at odds with the vibrancy and colour palette of the industry that Penn 
  prolifically documented. It's clear that Penn intended to delve deeper into 
  his subjects own constitution exposing the person below the surface. What 
  would he capture in them that they did not want others to see? 
</p>
<p>
Penn has been described as a photographer recording fashion history from the 
  1940s, taking his last photo in 2007 aged 92. I came to the end of my fourth 
  revolution of the photos believing that Penn had documented modern cultural 
  history itself based on the sheer range and level of celebrity of the people 
  he photographed. I concluded that Penn had an amazing eye for tones, 
  textures, elegance versus humility and the human condition in a way that 
  sets him aside as a true genius behind the lens. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number seventeen is <strong>Jerome Kiel</strong>
</p>
<p>
From the forties to the noughties, Irving Penn used his artistic skills, his 
  vision and unconventional approach to take photographs of an astonishing 
  variety of people from the realms of writing, music, art and drama. 
</p>
<p>
The exhibition is stunning, with its useful texts and 110 portraits. Their 
  lighting and backgrounds, often two canvas panels, had an impact on every 
  sitter. Each photograph reveals nuances, tensions and body language, a 
  realism not shown by Irving Penn&rsquo;s contemporaries. 
</p>
<p>
In 1948, for example, violinist Yehudi Menuhin has his back to one panel. His 
  right hand is high on the opposite one; he owns the space and smiles 
  slightly. His left hand casually holds his violin by its scroll. However, 
  the diminutive Georgia O&rsquo;Keefe looks enclosed and slightly petrified. 
</p>
<p>
In dull clothes, painter Joan Miro, sits in an easy chair, slightly 
  self-conscious. His daughter, Dolores, wearing a floral dress, sits to the 
  right. Her arm leans over the back of the dining chair. She holds his hand, 
  tilting her head towards her father, relaxed, almost meditative. 
  Interestingly, he is against a black background, she against a white, 
  perhaps a reflection of their two personalities; a barrier between them, 
  which only she is breaking through. 
</p>
<p>
In 1950, Richard Burton, sits forward, making his head seem larger. His left 
  elbow is leaning on the table, but his right hand comes round to protect it. 
  This gives the impression he is strong, defensive, forthright and 
  unyielding. He looks relaxed, yet, with his gaze fixed in a steely, but 
  mischievous, stare, he is still an enigma. 
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s legacy is still challenging and enables us to see the photographs as 
  artistic compositions through the media of a camera, with some rare and 
  difficult developing techniques and the talents of an extraordinary, 
  creative man. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number sixteen is <strong>David Coop</strong>
</p>
<p>
Sixty three years of photographic portraits demonstrate Penn&rsquo;s creative 
  consistency and technical mastery. 
</p>
<p>
Not simply the faces of some of the most significant figures of the twentieth 
  century, Penn&rsquo;s portraits are enduring images which engage the viewer. They 
  reveal a range of attitudes and reactions. Few of the subjects are smiling, 
  although Duke Ellington, and a relaxed Spencer Tracy are exceptions. 
</p>
<p>
Other such as Georgia O&rsquo;Keefe and the Duchess of Windsor seem tense and stiff. 
  A dishevelled Jacob Epstein displaying a missing trouser button and stained 
  work clothes contrasts with the impeccably groomed Grace Kelly and the 
  studied flamboyance of Jean Cocteau. 
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s photography changes from full length portraits of subjects posed 
  against plain backdrops through head and shoulder crops to intense facial 
  studies. His images are never less than exhilarating. The simple lighting, 
  isolating, emphasising or extinguishing subjects&rsquo; features is ever present. 
</p>
<p>
His compositions are delightful. Resorting to his early studies in graphic 
  design, Penn creates geometrical patterns with his subjects&rsquo; limbs. Dali, 
  ever the showman sits with arms and legs spread. A youthful Peter Ustinov 
  and Nicole Kidman contort their bodies into angular poses. 
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s lighting and composition may hint at tone and contrast but graphic 
  effect is ultimately controlled by his printing. Dense black shapes contrast 
  with paler facial features illustrated by his images of Pere Couturier and 
  Marlene Dietrich both photographed in 1948. 
</p>
<p>
Whilst most of the photographs here are gelatin silver there are a number of 
  platinum palladium prints including ones of Jesse Norman, Anais Nin and 
  Richard Avedon. Platinum palladian printing is a laborious, time consuming 
  process requiring a meticulous and disciplined technique resulting in prints 
  containing unsurpassed depth, luminosity and an extraordinary range of tones 
  which are a worthy high point of this excellently curated exhibition. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number fifteen is <strong>Maisie Gliddon </strong>
</p>
<p>
Irving Penn&rsquo;s largest exhibition of his works in 50 years: A beautiful fluid 
  journey of portraiture from the 1940&rsquo;s to 2007. A collection of some over a 
  100 portraits from Vogue editorials to subtle intimate photographs. Penn&rsquo;s 
  work provides the spectator with a completely new level of celebrity 
  portraiture. Each beautifully cropped and constructed photograph portrays 
  the subject in a state of sublime vulnerability; stripping away the 
  traditional connotations and boundaries of what is revealed in a portrait. 
  &ldquo;Very often what lies behind the fa&ccedil;ade is rare and more wonderful than the 
  subject knows or dares to believe.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s photographs are effortlessly timeless and most importantly incredible 
  to look at. The focus of each photograph is not only on the dramatic 
  contrasts of the black and white film, but also the soft lighting and 
  piercing eyes of the photographed subjects. The stunning silver gelatin 
  prints offer a rare vintage incandescent quality, in which most 
  photographers can only hope to achieve today. There are several notable 
  differences between Penn&rsquo;s concepts of fashion photography, in comparison to 
  today&rsquo;s. The 00&rsquo;s fashion photography has become part of lucrative celebrity 
  culture; rather than a striking visual language, providing us with fuel 
  injected monotonous dazed and confused &lsquo;snapshot&rsquo; images. What does this say 
  about this generation of photographers, so caught up in our fast paced 
  society revealing how we have lost the true serenity and care of the 
  photograph? 
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s success lies in the importance of precision, the little details such as 
  gentle natural lighting and meticulous planned composition. Penn is and will 
  continue to be a giant in world of photographic portraiture.

Finalist number fourteen is <strong>Surabhi S Khanna</strong>
</p>
<p>
Don't just stand there, let's get to it/Strike a pose, there's nothing to 
  it/Vogue! 
</p>
<p>
Nothing to it? Sorry Madonna, but Irving Penn begs to differ: &ldquo;very often what 
  lies behind the fa&ccedil;ade is rare and more wonderful than the subject knows or 
  dares to believe&rdquo;. 
</p>
<p>
The exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery displays an enchanting 
  retrospective collection of vintage prints by the master of photographic 
  portraiture himself. We are greeted by an amusing photograph of one of 
  Penn&rsquo;s idols in 1944. A laurelled Giorgio de Chirico, gazes casually out of 
  his gelatine printed domain, (bench)marking the start of our journey through 
  time, observing how Penn&rsquo;s minimalistic style of photography to capture the 
  true nature of an individual evolved. 
</p>
<p>
Curator Magdalene Keaney has compiled a comprehensive, captivating display of 
  works that show clear stylistic progression and Penn&rsquo;s thoughts on 
  photography through time. From full length shots with un-glamorous props 
  such as the portrait of Georgia O&rsquo; Keeffe dwarfed by two large wooden boards 
  at her sides to close-ups of the face focussed on the gestures expressing 
  traits of the sitter that would not normally be apparent. The portrait of 
  designer Issey Miyake, glowering out from beneath a dark hood is one of my 
  favourites from the series, dramatic brooding and totally unconventional- 
  much like his technology driven fashion line. 
</p>
<p>
Every photograph competes for your attention despite the simple setting in a 
  low lit gallery(- an homage to Penn&rsquo;s religious use of tungsten lighting 
  perhaps?). Penn&rsquo;s clever use of lighting to produce the dramatic contrasts 
  of light and shadow seen in portraits of: &ldquo;Woody Allen as Charlie Chaplin&rdquo; 
  or of showgirl Josephine Baker, is in full view for all to admire at the 
  exhibition. 
</p>
<p>
These photographs are only making guest appearances at the National Portrait 
  Gallery till the 6th of June, so why not experience the power of portrait 
  photography through the lens of Irving Penn? 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number thirteen is <strong>Lauren Rotenberg</strong>
</p>
<p>
Irving Penn Portraits at the National Portrait Gallery successfully traces the 
  evolution of the American photographer&rsquo;s studio portraits from 1947-2007, 
  emphasizing the continuity and consistency of his vision, sensitivity to his 
  subject, and technical finesse. The chronological presentation of 123 black 
  and white photographs highlights Penn&rsquo;s transition from full-length staged 
  portraits to cropped and dramatic headshots of leading cultural figures. It 
  celebrates his interest in the medium of photography (and its limits) as a 
  way to capture the &lsquo;interiority&rsquo; of sitters and to discover, as Penn states, 
  &ldquo;what lies behind the fa&ccedil;ade.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s innovative use of simple grey backdrops, natural lighting and minimal 
  props resists the narratives of complex settings and costumes. 
  Claustrophobic corners draw the viewer into the intimate space of the 
  sitter, and allow for subtle gestures, expressions, and individual 
  uniqueness to emerge. Penn&rsquo;s mastery of triangular compositions and sharp 
  contrasts between light and dark (the chiaroscuro technique inspired by de 
  Chirco) produce dramatic movement and tension within the frames. This play 
  of light and shadow, revelation and concealment, is best articulated in 
  portraits of Pablo Picasso, Issey Miyake, and Arthur Miller. 
</p>
<p>
The modest mention of Penn&rsquo;s travels in Europe, experimentation with platinum 
  printing techniques, and commercial experience at Vogue results in an 
  incomplete portrayal of his achievements. With the exception of four 
  magazines secured in glass, Penn&rsquo;s portraits are removed from their original 
  context of fashion magazines that, accompanied by editorial texts, 
  constructed popular notions of mid-20th century femininity. While Penn 
  &ldquo;challenged and changed the expectation of studio portraiture,&rdquo; his 
  relevance endures as a fashion photographer who conveyed a certain regal, 
  chic, or coy femininity; here, represented only in the photographs of Grace 
  Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, and Lisa Fonssagrives-Penn. Although intimate and 
  illuminating, the exhibition falls short of producing the greatest portrait 
  of a legendary photographer. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number twelve is <strong>Renske Mann</strong>
</p>
<p>
Judging by his portraits, Irving Penn could have excelled in any medium other 
  than photography. His classic compositions are mathematically precise and 
  symmetrical. He was the first to use plain backgrounds for minimal 
  distraction. Cecil Beaton said Penn made life hard for himself, using few 
  props and simple lighting. Remarkably, he remained an innovator throughout 
  his 70-year photographic career. 
</p>
<p>
Penn evidently felt the need to prove himself a painter&rsquo;s equal. The Angel 
  (1946) could pass for a Goya etching: the wrestler's grotesque, oversized 
  head, chest and fists are bathed in diffused lighting. Balanced on his right 
  foot, his body tilts towards the light source, giving a rare illusion of 
  movement. 
</p>
<p>
Another photograph of a group of ballet dancers resembles a monotone Degas 
  pastel. A party of Vogue photographers is inspired by Manet&rsquo;s Dejeuner Sur 
  l&rsquo;Herbe and the painterly influence persists into the &lsquo;fifties: the 
  hard-edged minimalism of Harlequin Dress (1950), modelled by his wife, Lisa 
  Fonssagrives-Penn, is not a million miles from Mondrian. 
</p>
<p>
Penn distilled character by exploring gesture, so hands and body language are 
  often as important as faces. He photographed Truman Capote twice, once in 
  the &lsquo;forties and again in the &lsquo;sixties. Both images reflect his style 
  evolution through the decades. The first shows the author clearly unhappy, 
  half-kneeling and crouching on a chair, like a Guantanamo stress position. 
  Wrapped in a tweed coat, the pose is secretive, defensive, with hands tucked 
  deep inside pockets. The &lsquo;sixties print typifies Penn&rsquo;s later cropped 
  close-ups, showing a jaded Capote rubbing his eyes in fatigue, specs 
  dangling from one hand. 
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s darkroom wizardry was legendary, but in the final analysis, 
  paraphrasing Cezanne on Monet, &ldquo;he was just an eye, but what an eye!&rdquo; 
  Paradoxically with his fashion background, he seemed best at photographing 
  older men and women. It required no master of Penn&rsquo;s stature to do justice 
  to Audrey Hepburn or Grace Kelly. Their beauty spoke for itself. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number eleven is <strong>Lauren Price-Evans</strong>
</p>
<p>
Entering a room full of faces is hardly unanticipated in the National Portrait 
  Gallery, but there is something unique about the faces captured by Irving 
  Penn that captivates the viewer. The images are brutally sincere; it is more 
  like stumbling into a room with windows into the private lives of the 
  sitters. 
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s portraits, with their bare backgrounds and natural lighting, seem at 
  first to distil their subjects. Standing in an empty studio, the subjects 
  are extracted from their usual environments and forced to reveal themselves, 
  removed from the rest of the world. One portrait of Georgia O&rsquo;Keefe is 
  exemplary of this, the artist known for her vividly colourful and boundary 
  pushing paintings is in black and white, confined to a corner with arms 
  behind her back. We are forced to contemplate the woman behind the 
  paintings, looking at her stance and facial expression. Other photographs 
  cut out most of the subject&rsquo;s body entirely, severing off tops of heads, in 
  order to concentrate on the exquisite details in the face. But the 
  distillation process isn&rsquo;t perfect; the ground is often littered with scraps 
  of fabric or cigarette butts and when the focus is on the face, every flaw 
  is vulnerably visible. Penn manages to isolate his subjects from the 
  connotations surrounding them and expose their humanity. 
</p>
<p>
However, the artist seems simultaneously aware of the fact that he will never 
  fully portray the inner-face of his sitters. Penn says himself that &lsquo;...a 
  limitation of our medium is that the inside is recordable only in so far as 
  it is apparent on the outside.&rsquo; His later works reflect this sentiment as 
  they give equal attention to the detail we can see and that which we cannot. 
  He reminds us to look beyond general outward appearances and focus in 
  closer. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number ten is <strong>Josephine Thum, aged 14</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have always thought a photographer cannot be easily recognised. They cannot 
  stylise their work in the varying and diverse ways that painters, or 
  sculptors can. This exhibition proved me wrong. 
</p>
<p>
Irving Penn&rsquo;s sense of personal style was so strongly developed I felt I could 
  sense him in each of his photographs. He has a way of capturing a person&rsquo;s 
  essence, and emotions so well, that I almost felt intrusive looking at them. 
  Many of the portraits, such as Al Pacino&rsquo;s, were extremely personal; 
  defining every contour and detail of the face with striking lighting, but 
  also bringing forward something deeper behind it. The exhibition showed 120 
  of his portraits, spanning Penn&rsquo;s career, from 1944 &ndash; 2007. I found it 
  fascinating to see how his work progressed, and although none of the 
  portraits were wildly different, I found every one beautifully simplistic, 
  Penn having engineered the shot to the height of minimalism. 
</p>
<p>
Having been a fashion photographer for Vogue for many years, Penn&rsquo;s portraits 
  often have a stylised flair, and I thought this was reflected strongly in 
  the exhibition. For those who like fashion, there were many of his portraits 
  centred around it. The monochrome and simplicity of the portraits were very 
  contemporary, and far ahead of his time, one of the things, I thought, that 
  defined him as an artist. It was also interesting to see the collection of 
  famous faces Penn shot; Christian Dior, Audrey Hepburn, Salvador Dali, Pablo 
  Picasso and many more. If you are an art enthusiast, I would definitely 
  recommend this innovative exhibition. I found his range of subjects 
  fascinating, and the perceptive way in which they are presented quite 
  stunning. I walked into this exhibition knowing little about Irving Penn, 
  but I now regard him as one of the most talented photographers of the 20th 
  century. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number nine is <strong>Carlo Chinca</strong>
</p>
<p>
Born in 1917, New Jersey, Irving Penn studied design under Alexey Brodovitch 
  at the Philadelphia Museum School of Art. In 1938 he moved to New York and 
  worked as a freelance designer, making drawings of shoes for Harpers Bazaar 
  which earned him enough money to buy his first camera, a Rolleiflex. His 
  work has ranged from street photographs of America in the 1940&rsquo;s to fashion, 
  celebrity portraits and still life advertising photographs for Harpers 
  Bazaar and Vogue. He travelled the world with a portable studio 
  photographing the indigenous people of Morocco, Papua New Guinea, Cameroon, 
  Dahomey, Peru and more. 
</p>
<p>
This exhibition is made up of 123 black and white portraits laid out in 
  chronological order beginning in 1944 and ending in 2007 - two years before 
  Penn&rsquo;s death. The majority of these portraits were taken in his studio using 
  simple backdrops of painted cloth, panels and carpet. The lighting is simple 
  - often soft powdery light from a window or skylight. 
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s pictures are like Rembrandt&rsquo;s paintings and charcoal drawings - deep 
  black shadows giving way to bright highlights with all details revealed. 
  Stark, sculptural, full of folds and textures. Figures seated, figures 
  crammed into corners. Picasso peers from under his sombrero, Alfred 
  Hitchcock hunched and mysterious, Marlene Dietrich black caped and radiant. 
  Rudolf Nureyev with a quizzical stare, while in contrast, Grace Kelly 
  strikes a typical pose and simply &lsquo;glows&rsquo;. A 1946 portrait &lsquo;The Angel&rsquo; is a 
  full length picture of professional wrestler Maurice Tillet striking a 
  pugilistic pose with bare chest, black tights, gigantic head, like a 
  grotesque Coney Island freak. 
</p>
<p>
Irving Penn is photography&rsquo;s nonpareil - a champion of chiaroscuro and master 
  of silver gelatin and platinum printing techniques. He created a style most 
  photographers find almost impossible not to imitate. In this digital age, 
  it&rsquo;s a breath of fresh air to view the prints of the past. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number eight is <strong>Harry Burke</strong>
</p>
<p>
The freshness of Irving Penn's photography is evident from his earliest 
  portrait on display at this highly appealing exhibition, which captures one 
  of the photographer's formative heros, the Italian artist Giorgio de 
  Chirico, standing bemusedly at the bottom of the Spanish Steps, with a 
  naturalism that is almost as spontaneous as the chance meeting itself. Yet 
  despite never changing his intimate and personable approach to the photo 
  portrait, this freshness is not lost throughout the fifty years of Penn's 
  illustrious career, even to today's image weary eyes. 
</p>
<p>
One of the main characteristics of Penn's work was his belief that portrait 
  photography should reveal the true character behind the facade of the human 
  face, and this is achieved in a manner that is as charming as it is honest, 
  as embodied in the cigarette butts and studio debris that he doesn't care to 
  omit. However his real secret was his ability to reveal as much of the 
  artist as of the subject, which forms a large part of what makes this 
  exhibition so revealing. 
</p>
<p>
What is truly striking about this highly impressive body of work, though, is 
  the range of incredible characters that one can meet, creating almost a role 
  call of some of the most fascinating figures of the twentieth century. For 
  what I find most compelling about Penn's work, from the full body portraits 
  of his early years to the closer, cropped compositions of his later studies, 
  is that fact that almost all of his subjects are looking into the camera, 
  and as such at the viewer. Nowhere else is it possible to go eyeball to 
  eyeball to such an illustrious and iconic range of personalities in one 
  space, ranging from Duke Ellington through to Jean Cocteau and even an 
  eccentrically posed Salvador Dali. This is the true magic of the exhibition. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number seven is <strong>Alex Van Baalen</strong>
</p>
<p>
In a frantic world of instant imagery and throw away fashion this exhibition 
  of his work is like stepping through the looking glass into a world where 
  time stands still and one learns to see the world through the lens of one of 
  the great photographers of our time. 
</p>
<p>
Penn once said, &lsquo;A good photograph is one that communicates a fact, touches 
  the heart and leaves the viewer a changed person&rsquo;. This is true of this 
  exhibition where his love of capturing both the beauty and rawness of his 
  subjects leaves you feeling both drawn to the boldness of the images and yet 
  also slightly unsettled by their stark reality. 
</p>
<p>
It is in his fashion photography where this sense of timelessness is most 
  felt. It is not so much about how the clothing is worn but more about 
  creating dramatic shapes. Shapes that have a restrained air about them, yet 
  also a boldness of presence. One is transported back to a time where a mere 
  gesture with the hand or look from below a heavily painted eyelid could 
  convey a sense of sophistication lost today. These images have inspired many 
  of today&rsquo;s great fashion designers to translate this feeling into a look. 
  Clothes that reek of sophistication yet have an underlying raw sensuality 
  about them. A reoccurring theme in all art forms and yet captured so simply 
  by Penn making him as relevant today as he was at the height of his 
  popularity. A modern hero reminding us all that less is still very much 
  more. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number six is <strong>Rosalind Berwald </strong>
</p>
<p>
The 120 photographs in the show reveal Penn&rsquo;s desire for the hidden truth, the 
  soul beneath. 
</p>
<p>
Penn, who died last year, was a man who painted with his camera. His idea of 
  placing his subjects in cupboard-like corners, against grey tonal 
  backgrounds, was unique. 
</p>
<p>
Trapped in the corner like a naughty boy huddled in his overcoat, his face lit 
  naturally by an overhead skylight, Jacques Fath holds an open pair of 
  scissors, trying to carve his way out. 
</p>
<p>
The light is exquisite, sheer craft: ballet dancers in their confinement, 
  photographed in snowy drops of light, almost dissolve away. He never minded 
  the mess on the studio floor - to Penn it is what happened with the camera 
  that mattered. 
</p>
<p>
Everyone famous beat a path to his door. Francis Bacon is pictured in black, 
  eyes looking upwards, with every mark and spot on his face visible. Truman 
  Capote, finger pressed into his cheek, forming dark hollows and deep ridges, 
  appears like a bare vision of reality. Hitchcock, sitting on a roll of 
  grubby carpet, clearly hides a surprised look on his face. How did he get up 
  those six flights of stairs to Penn's studio? Can it be the same carpet 
  Marlene Dietrich sits on, back towards us, bathed in light? 
</p>
<p>
Before you leave look at the glorious portrait of Duke Ellington, his hand 
  holding the collar of his brilliant white coat. This is Penn at his best; a 
  revelation of Ellington's joyful soul. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number five is <strong>Ama Scott</strong>
</p>
<p>
Irving Penn once wrote that &ldquo;very often what lies behind the fa&ccedil;ade is rare 
  and more wonderful than the subject knows or dares to believe.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>
A collection of works by the renowned photographer at London&rsquo;s National 
  Portrait Gallery this spring certainly encapsulates these words. Penn&rsquo;s 
  portraits are subtle, unassuming, and yet entirely provocative. 
</p>
<p>
The exhibition displays a selection of the most celebrated characters of the 
  last century, including Marlene Dietrich, Pablo Picasso and Truman Capote. 
  In showing the sitters at their most personal, and in many cases vulnerable, 
  Penn gives a moving portrayal not often associated with such icons. 
</p>
<p>
The metamorphosis in style that takes place over Penn&rsquo;s fifty-year career is 
  especially evident, from his full-body captures of the Forties, to more 
  intimate close-up portraits of later years. The finest points of his 
  subjects&rsquo; personalities are unashamedly displayed by the photographer in 
  surroundings powerful due to their sheer simplicity. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most memorable work of the exhibition is that of French novelist 
  Colette, taken in 1951, three years before her death. One of few photographs 
  taken at this stage in her life, the portrait is witty and charming, yet 
  chilling. 
</p>
<p>
Another highly original depiction is Penn&rsquo;s 1988 portrait of fashion designer 
  Issey Miyake. Only one side of the sitters face is revealed, the other being 
  cloaked in fabric. What is so unsettling is Miyake&rsquo;s single, penetrating 
  eye, which mesmerizes the viewer, not unlike a snake with its prey. 
</p>
<p>
Through his extraordinary control over light and shadow, Penn tactfully delves 
  into the individual qualities of each sitter, whilst at the same time 
  leaving them with their sense of mystery intact. It is such innovation that 
  sets Irving Penn apart from his peers, making him one of the most unique and 
  evocative photo-portraitists of his generation. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number four is <strong>Jane Whitfield</strong>
</p>
<p>
The endlessly unique human figure takes centre stage in this magnificent 
  collection of portraits by Irving Penn: a dazzling company of cultural 
  figures taken during a career that began in the early 1940s and went on to 
  span seven decades. The poet W H Auden (captured here by Penn looking 
  somewhat benign and unusually smooth-faced) wrote that the primary subject 
  of art would always be for him &lsquo;the human clay&rsquo;: Penn&rsquo;s black and white 
  photographs give us this human clay with an intense clarity, simplicity and 
  beauty. 
</p>
<p>
The work is imbued with these qualities by Penn&rsquo;s insistence that his sitters 
  come before him in the equal space of his sparse studio: standing on a bare 
  wooden floor, cornered by two unpainted stud walls the Duchess of Windsor is 
  a wary, monochrome &lsquo;geisha&rsquo;; kneeling on a hard wooden chair Truman Capote 
  is a fallen, unrepentant angel. Posed and composed, constrained and 
  unconstrained, natural and unnatural light seeming to illuminate them from 
  within, rarely is anything allowed to distract the subjects&rsquo; gaze from 
  meeting the master&rsquo;s lens. If props to identify the sitter are allowed they 
  seem an almost unnecessary extravagance: Yehudi Menuhin&rsquo;s violin, Cecil 
  Beaton&rsquo;s nude with a camera, Charles James&rsquo; tailor&rsquo;s dummy and Francis 
  Bacon&rsquo;s scrappy copies of Rembrandt&rsquo;s self-portraits. 
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s use of this equal space gives his work not just a sense of unity but of 
  timelessness: one&rsquo;s anchor to a period and a time may only be a sartorial 
  one (only Balthus in a paint spattered coat tied with string looks suitably 
  bohemian). &lsquo;Pictures with people in&rsquo; was the deceptively simple title David 
  Hockney gave his first solo show in 1963: &lsquo;[Photographs] with people in &rsquo; 
  would be an equally appropriate title for curator Magdalene Keaney&rsquo;s 
  stunning Penn retrospective in 2010. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number three is <strong>David Graham</strong>
</p>
<p>
For those unfamiliar with Penn&rsquo;s work, you might be struck on first 
  impressions that you are seeing a slightly out of date series of black and 
  white portraits that have little relevance in today&rsquo;s age. Yes, the 
  portraits are mainly of famous people, from Picasso to Nicole Kidman, but 
  they tell us more about the subjects than most photographs that we see 
  today. And that is Penn&rsquo;s genius. 
</p>
<p>
He turns the face into a topographic landscape where every pore, expression 
  and texture is nuanced in a manner that most photographers appear incapable 
  of today. His subjects are revealed warts and all without regard to their 
  status or importance and fortunately for the viewer, before the days of 
  publicists, stylists and Photoshop. 
</p>
<p>
Penn originally trained as a graphic designer and his photographs are about 
  shape and the design on the page. Many of the images are truly black and 
  white not shades of grey and it is the extreme contrast between light and 
  shade that further distinguishes Penn&rsquo;s images. 
</p>
<p>
The exhibition spans some seven decades of his work and one clearly sees a 
  progression as he finds his confidence and defines his style. The sitters 
  frequently look uncomfortable and that is because he meant them to. Only in 
  the last decade of his life does his work lose its magic for me as he 
  experiments more with modern trends in lighting and appears to have given in 
  to the demands of editors and stylists to be nice to his subjects. 
</p>
<p>
However, the exhibition is a must for anyone who aspires to take portraits or 
  is interested to see famous figures of the past 60 years stripped bare of 
  their pretensions. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number two is <strong>John Hooton</strong>
</p>
<p>
The exhibition of Irving Penn&rsquo;s portraits at the National Portrait Gallery 
  starts from 1944, with whole plate contact prints made directly from the 
  negative without any enlargement. Penn began by using large format bellows 
  cameras which are the perfect discipline to formulate technical finesse. 
  Like his sitters, the photographer is detached from the camera, appraising 
  with his eyes rather than through a viewfinder. Large format necessitated 
  slow exposures. His subjects had to remain still and this is reflected in 
  the watchful but fixed poses, some wedged between studio flats. 
</p>
<p>
There is an artist&rsquo;s roughness around the edges of his work. Backgrounds are 
  dirty, the dull daylight from the studio roof is just adequate, and the 
  expressions of his subjects are dispassionate. This is the essential Penn; 
  his photographs are slightly off beat. He is not searching for the kind of 
  perceived perfection that we are familiar with today, but strips the process 
  to the bare fundamentals, extracting a raw depth from his sitters. He 
  creates a timeless quality that is the key to lasting appeal. 
</p>
<p>
In the mid fifties he began using roll film cameras. The new measured 
  animation of his subjects is noticeable. He also tried tight cropping, 
  cutting the tops of heads which was clearly an influence upon latter day 
  photographers. The technical excellence of Penn&rsquo;s work is still an enduring 
  inspiration for photographers who strive for the perfect black and white 
  print. Subtle changes throughout the tonal range; solid blacks that graduate 
  to small white highlights. 
</p>
<p>
His approach to photography was as sturdy as a wooden tripod. He was not 
  seduced by the appeal of 35mm convenience, preferring the type of equipment 
  where photography began. 
</p>
<p>
His legacy to humanity as a photographic portrait authority has never been 
  surpassed, both in merit and elegance. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Finalist number one is <strong>Jia Yun Cheng</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
I stepped into the exhibition almost breathless, anticipating a gigantic 
  wall-to-ceiling print of &ldquo;pioneer supermodel&rdquo; Lisa Fonssagrives shrouded in 
  a hat of pheasant feathers. But the first photo in the Irving Penn Portraits 
  exhibition was a small, absurd headshot of the artist Giorgio de Chirico, 
  his head surrounded by bizarre olive branches. His indignant glare 
  immediately extinguished my juvenile fantasy. 
</p>
<p>
Penn&rsquo;s early work of the 1940s is printed in modest size. His sitters are 
  often clad in black, drawing your eye to the sitter&rsquo;s exposed face. The 
  pioneer of modern architecture, Le Corbusier, sat not perched, but languid, 
  upon a grey hill of cloth. Penn&rsquo;s inclination in his full-length portraits 
  towards dark garment and simple prop, reminiscent of Vel&agrave;zquez&rsquo;s court 
  paintings, delivers the universal form of the human body hidden yet 
  accentuated: beautiful but quiet statements of immaculate composition. 
  Colour is neutralized by Penn&rsquo;s monochrome palette, the superficial 
  trademark of this exhibition. 
</p>
<p>
Superficial, because it is hardly Penn&rsquo;s palette that defines his work. It is 
  how he wields it to narrate a story that is about what we all like to think 
  we conceal well. Alfred Hitchcock, photographed in 1947, gazed at me with 
  idle menace like a rotund, if somewhat amused Mona Lisa. In Dali&rsquo;s 
  unconventionally symmetrical portrait, his sitting figure is an inviting &lsquo;X&rsquo; 
  that accentuates the madness patterned into his uneven gaze. As with all of 
  Penn&rsquo;s work, dramatic tonal contrast fights a tense battle with stillness. 
</p>
<p>
The play between dynamism and austerity is the true trademark of Penn&rsquo;s 
  60plus-year oeuvre, springing from Penn&rsquo;s patient yet restless search for 
  truth behind the enigma of the human face. 
</p>
<p>
Fonssagrives fantasy forgotten, I left this exhibition educated about how 
  beauty is not always about vogue, rather, one finds beauty in this 
  invigorating tribute to Penn&rsquo;s immortal portraits.

Exit Wave by Jon Wright of Australia is the winning photograph in this year's competition chosen from over 114,000 entries. His picture was also the winner of the Adrenaline category.

Of the photograph Jon says, "This underwater photograph was taken at Duranbah beach near the Gold Coast City in Australia. Beautiful clear waters and fine waves were on offer. As the set waves approach, I held my breath and dived deep, opening my eyes underwater to get myself in the perfect position. Shooting on high-speed continuous enabled me to choose the perfect single shot."

Jon, who is just 24, developed a love of photography from a very early age, but only began taking his own photos three years ago with his first camera, a Canon EOS 40D. "Most of my photos are inspired by what nature has to offer in and around the ocean," he says. "I broke my back in three places after a surfing accident, but I managed to continue my love and passion for the water through my photography. I continue to search for the perfect picture, and on my way hope to inspire others to be creative and enjoy what life has to offer."" border="0" width="140" height="87" />
