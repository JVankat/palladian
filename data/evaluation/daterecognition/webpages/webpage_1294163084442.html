    	<div class="sf_blog_entry">
    		Web-chatter&nbsp;these days seems to be all ablaze with discussions of the New World Order.&nbsp; Alex Jones and Glenn Beck are both discussing the imminent take over of the world by a bunch of crooked Banksters, Lizards and the&nbsp;ever present&nbsp;Illuminati. The NWO types herd us through X-ray machines and grope our children. They exemplify the idea of weird-o central.&nbsp; Why do we allow these people to stay on the island? <BR><BR>Glenn Beck finally decided to catch up with those of us in the know and call a spade a spade. Of course, he still&nbsp;skirts&nbsp;9/11 because his "handlers" won't allow him to address the one issue that&nbsp;will expose the true depth of the&nbsp;lie being perpetrated upon the planet.&nbsp;Glenn is misled, or perhaps just not quite wide awake, he&nbsp;does not see the whole story.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no awareness of the evolutionary phase we are in and why things are happening the way they are. The Seventh Day of the Galactic Cycle is about&nbsp;<STRONG>ETHICS</STRONG> my friends. <BR><BR>Limbaugh said something to the extent that this Wikileak guy (Assange) is nobody's hero. Who is he kidding? Rush is a protector of the Status Quo. He sells you and I on the fact that he is really "on our side" and "a regular guy" but really, why would we want the truth about our scumball politicians NOT to come out? Does he not see the whole kit and kaboodle is broken? I for one welcome Wikileaks. I see it a catalyst&nbsp;&nbsp;to accelerate the end of unstainable structures that have ruked and ruined our lives for too long. The Elite will tell us that these secrets coming out&nbsp;are going to "kill" our brave men and women who are in the line of fire.&nbsp; Bull. We die daily due to <STRONG>their lies, incompetence, greed and cover-ups</STRONG>. Wikileaks = ETHICS. No stone shall go unturned, all secrets, all corruption, all lies&nbsp;will be exposed. <BR><BR>Like the Alchemists "Nigredo" this time signifies the difficulties man has to overcome on his journey through the underworld. A&nbsp;putrefaction so effective that it destroys the old nature and form of rotting bodies; it transmutes them into a <EM>new state of being</EM> to give them <EM>totally new fruit</EM>. The pilgrim traditionally encounters shadows, monsters, demons on the voyage to the center of&nbsp;his problems, emotions and self&nbsp;.&nbsp; In our world this translates not only to our inner demons but the collective demons without. We are projecting our shadow world and must see it's corruption to attain enlightenment. Once we have accepted&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibility for our complicity in allowing&nbsp;this corruption and degradation of life on Earth to&nbsp;happen we can then transmute the <BR>corruption into FERTILIZER for the new world.<BR><BR>We&nbsp;must regard the machinations of Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh as they rail against the "evil du jour" as&nbsp; a sideshows, just another distraction&nbsp; to the main event. &nbsp;The main event is the evolution, we are gaining or Christed hearts.&nbsp;The subsequent development&nbsp;will be of the&nbsp;new human, a non consuming, light being that&nbsp;is self renewing&nbsp;through a type of photosythesis.&nbsp; As sovereign beings this&nbsp;means our internal energy is now supplied by open channels of communication with the Source.<BR><BR>We are learning to become these light beings. It is our next step on the evolutionary chain.&nbsp; We all agreed to come here and experience this density so that we could compress it all, just like the stars are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must compress all of our knowing, our senses and our feelings into the zero point.&nbsp; We are taking along with us all of the experiences of the past but we won't remember them as we do today. The past will&nbsp;become just the&nbsp;forces that&nbsp;shaped us.&nbsp; We will remember&nbsp;the past as something that&nbsp;"Everyone played their part perfectly. We were right on time." As we compress all of the good and all of the evil that has occurred on this planet we&nbsp;<EM>accept</EM> that it&nbsp;was all important and all necessary to the evolution of our kind.&nbsp;WE do not hang onto our guilt, sadness or remorse over man's inhumanity to man.&nbsp;We become the Galactic Butterfly because&nbsp;we have experienced the depth of the darkness and are now&nbsp;free to&nbsp;ride the height of the light.<BR><BR>The Seventh Day and the exposure of the top echelons of ethics over the next year will be a remarkable joureny.&nbsp;&nbsp;Politics and the NWO are a sideshow to the ascension, is&nbsp;Glenn really that blind to&nbsp;<EM>why</EM> the awakening is happening.&nbsp; does he not know that Apocalypse means "the great unveiling"?<BR><BR>The evolution is upon us and our power to choose the future is&nbsp;more important&nbsp;than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must&nbsp;choose from heart based decisions, choose sovereignty for all, choose a resource based economy, choose a world&nbsp;powered by&nbsp;free energy not by the energy of money.&nbsp; Choose a vision that exalts man and lifts him up to his true divine potential.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Those of us that believe such things do not give any credence to those that believe his fellow man is stupid, greedy or unable to achieve such standing. There are those of us that know something deep inside, we have seen a vital truth about our future. This vital truth is our true destiny. I intend to be with my friends in the 5th dimension creating a new world.&nbsp; Or maybe just laughing. Laughing for years to come.<p><span class="chicklet_group"></span></p>

    		<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">    "The Evolution Movement" is part two of a multi-media theatrical experience that delivers an innovative vision for the future of mankind. This vision is inspired by the true story of the discovery of a miraculous new source of energy. This energy is presented, and the new world that comes with it, by "surfing the web” of collective consciousness. Using a mix of media, scientific fact, dance, soliloquy and cultural touchstones this 60 minute project has the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">objective to raise awareness about free energy.  </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;"> </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">    I am a professional theatrical lighting designer developing my artistic voice and original work around the evolution of consciousness and man’s untapped potential. I am inspired to combine the magic of the theatre with the mystery of man’s aptitude to create. The living mystery of the imagination and its role in creating change began to develop as a philosophy for me in 2004 as I embarked on a voyage to discover what might be the human agenda. This journey has distanced me from cultural, political and religious beliefs even as I understand deeply how these things have shaped our world. I have come to believe that man’s potential is undermined by these cultural and common belief systems. Limiting our consideration limits our imagination. <br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">    This production aspires to manifest thoughtful changes to our collective consciousness, and our manifest reality, by working to establish a heart-coherent wave in part one and introduce a vision for the future in part two. There is distinct evidence that sustained emotion, coupled with an intention can enact change to our inner and outer environments. This means we can manifest change by feeling good and thinking good thoughts about a good idea.  <br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;"><br />
    I produced part one, “The Language of Light” in 2008. This theatrical dance production incorporated innovative techniques involving sound, light and vibration to create what Noetic science calls “a heart-coherent state of appreciation” in the audience. It has been found that when large numbers of people intentionally create heart-coherent states of care, love, compassion and appreciation they will generate a consistent standing wave that can offset the current planetary-wide wave of stress, discord, fear and incoherence. “The Language of Light” provides a good feeling by sharing through popular music and dance; the energy of mans “light within”. We explore what animates man’s spirit through dance and using the concept of the seven Chakra energy centers.  The end of part one culminates in the creation of our heroine, a human named Astrea.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;"><br />
    Part two; “The Evolution Movement” provides the vision and an intention. Astrea discovers, in a true ‘Dan Brown’ style of sourcing unusual materials, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">a miraculous new energy that is produced through the harmonic mixing of simple ingredients to create a “heartbeat” of unending, clean energy. The discovery of the heartbeat energy means that we will rebalance our waters, our air, our planet and our blood while providing a free, clean, unending source of power for everyone. Securing a healthy global future requires that we preserve freedom of spirit, and that technology and values are based on scientific guiding principles without prejudice. “The Evolution Movement” shows that these scientific guiding principles also have a dimension of spirit that animates them. The heartbeat energy is created by the same means that the heartbeat sparks to life inside each human being. This is energy that requires a certain PH and a certain harmonic to come alive. The story of this new energy hopes to serve as a catalyst for expanding man’s understanding of a magic that may be available to all.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;"><br />
    “The Evolution Movement” is set in an office/laboratory and becomes a theatrical interpretation of “surfing the web”. The story is told through a series of vignettes, video used as backdrops to dancers, audio speakers installed in Harlequin costumes and the use of a few cultural icons as commentators (in their own words and voice). There are three-dimensional projection surfaces and many areas on the stage/office that lighting will be have an interesting and mystical effect.  Exploring the creases of the Internet and counter-culture subjects such as The New World Order, The Mayan Calendar, Illuminati, and Time Wave Zero, we begin to understand our own reflection, our sovereign hearts and the truth of what we give our attention to can become real.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;"><br />
            The dancers/speakers tell us the story of the energy through a type work I am calling “re-combining”. This work takes aspects of different speeches, songs and visual images and re-combines them, putting new emphasis on the message. A vision for the future and lessons from the past are explored using the words of Terence McKenna, John Lennon and Martin Luther King among others.  As an artist I enjoy spectacle, deep color, heartfelt messages and rock-n-roll in my work. My biggest challenge in “The Evolution Movement” is to present the content in a fluent, fast, understandable manner that intrigues while it informs. I would like to work with a director, a video production artist, and a choreographer to help me shape the content and delivery of this performance. <br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;"><br />
            “The Language of Light” was my first original theatre work, featuring 57 dancers from all levels of learning and resulted in a beautifully realized production of considerable scope. The second part allows me to thread my voice and story into a smaller more intimate work using the stage, still to create interesting pictures and surprising moments, but also to tell a good story without the use of traditional storytelling methods. The second part has fewer scenic and costume requirements and will depend more on video projection and dialogue between actors. Expectation is to produce next fall in Aspen, CO and then to tour the production to two other Colorado cities. <br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;"><br />
    I am an independent artist that has many resources and physical backing for my work. I live in an area that supports the idea of sustainable energy and innovative thinking. I propose to do this work as soon as possible as I believe it is timely and necessary for the next step of our evolution. This production is very human-centric, contrasting with institutional and cultural modes of thinking. This experience of reality and its inhibiting parameters is the enemy of our transcendence as evolving beings. I believe that without a vision, without a map, we may continue to wander in the darkness and never find our way to create the new world. </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: arial;">Not only do the earths magnetic fields affect humans, but conversely the Earth's energetic systems are also influenced by collective human emotions and consciousness. Much of the planetary field environment is made up of the collective consciousness of the inhabitants.  Be on alert for your own feelings and what vibe you may be adding to the universal soup.  The time to consciously create is now. Think about the future in idealized ways- reach for the highest choice!</span><p><span class="chicklet_group"></span></p>

    		<p style="margin: 0pt;">Imagine a story that has more twists and turns than the DiVinci Code, based in the present and involves the creation of an energy on this planet that could change man’s destiny forever.  This energy would replace all existing forms of power we currently use to motor our cars, homes, and all other planetary support systems. This energy is composed of nothing more than water, oxygen and hydrogen, elements already plentiful on the planet. This story of how the formula for this energy was found and the manner in which this discovery was made is of immense importance to the evolution of man’s consciousness and survival at this critical juncture in time. <br />
<br />
This is a story of how one goes about introducing this physical manifestation of clean, harmless, powerful energy. The Omega Energy as it is called is, has a deeper purpose than just that of providing unlimited, free, clean power to the planet. It is also about how the people on the planet respond to such information. The response of our collective is key to the energy manifesting.  Through this act of consciously creating we will come to find a new vision for man’s potential, a literal leap into our <i>purposeful </i>future.  This is the ultimate combining of natural and super-nature-al. <br />
<br />
Science seeks the truth of nature, but it is time also for science to seek the truth of spirit.  <br />
<br />
For some it will mean that they must go through releasing their belief in the current structures, attachment to governments, churches and belief systems to <em>allow themselves to yield to another idea</em>, that man exists in this universe to be the creator of ideas. Man grows ideas. Like little flowers in the stars, we are here to express novelty.<br />
<br />
The discovery of the Omega Energy will  provide a needed resource on the planet; the ability to safely provide free energy to the world.  The changes that can be derived from such a breakthrough lay the foundation to awaken many to the possibilities that have been carefully hidden from us.  While the swirling Omega Energy will be the physical manifestation of the power,  it’s twin energy, the spiritual component to such a powerful force,  will provide we humans with the needed vision to reinvent themselves into powerful, peaceful creators of a new culture.  </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"> <br />
<strong>Man Rises is a True Story </strong>is happening in real time, and happening as we speak. The formula for the Omega Energy is manifest and right on time for a planet ready to leap into a conscious future.  But we must do our work- we must envision the endgame- the outcome, what does the future looks like?  How does one talk about what the future is going to look like while living in the existing future? Good question- one which we should explore as we create and move towards this new world.  <br />
<br />
<em>This is the story of how you picked up the information and</em> <em>what you did with it</em>. This is about the amazing combining of spirit and science, a moment that could not have come at a better, more needed time. The putting aside of scientific or religious prejudice is at hand.  We must now combine these two into a better world, a more balanced perspective of man's soul and man's natural state. This combining of man's two states is regarded as Apotheosis.  His divine making. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;">The power of the Omega Energy lies not only in its physical representation but its spiritual representation as well.  The formula is the perfect combining of physical attributes and scientific discovery. The Omega Energy is the physical representation WE are bringing to the planet to match the spirit that is also arriving. To assure we create to the highest of our potential, to tip the scales towards the beautiful being we are destined to become we must each individually discover the depth of that beauty and the truth as it reveals itself to you. <br />
<br />
Finding the Omega Energy combines the natural, scientific world with the world of ancient texts, symbols and numerology.  The ancients are spilling their secrets. Is it also possible that the Omega Energy was once upon this planet and was withdrawn? <br />
<br />
Mixing the ingredients in a <em>harmonious fashion</em> is what creates the power. The power is embodied as the energy of the heart. Energy for our planet that is a beating heart.  The sacred heart that's truth was buried long ago by those that sought to control us. Or, maybe the sacred heart was purposefully hidden to shape man with more novelty and artistic sensibility?  Remember, the depth of the darkness is also the height of the light. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt;"> <br />
As we bring the energy onto the planet we contemplate it’s arriving. What does that look like?  If we join together we can simply steer our world towards a leap.  A leap in consciousness where the heart reigns supreme, heart energy drives our planet and we test our choices through the scientific method along with high ethical standards.  </p><p><span class="chicklet_group"></span></p>

    	<div class="sf_blog_entry">
    		<p style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: arial;">The Mind of a Conspiracy Theorist is the mind that made a choice to look behind the curtain and see what was there.  To bravely go where no man has gone before- <br />
<br />
While you are at it look at world religions, governments, wars and famines, scientific discovery, architects and engineers, and many, many pieces of a vast puzzle that essentially sums up the past 24,832 years on this planet.  Why this number? According to the cycles of life on this planet we are in the jaws of a mass extinction. <br />
<br />
<strong>I love the idea of a Dancing Harlequin.</strong>  You know once when I did my cards I did this little side study of two cards in relation to one another, which they were in the position that means together they create the Dancing Harlequin.  This Harlequin is made up of the Magician Card along with Adjustment.  Meaning that the <strong>magic needs balance</strong>. <strong>Magic happens when balance is achieved</strong>. So my Dancing Harlequin will have to navigate a very fine line to speak to you, my fellow travelers in time, in a way that will afford us both the opportunity to speak again in the future.  We must come to our own center to do the leap, we must Seek Only the Truth no matter how much it hurts us and exposes our misguided loyalties.<br />
<br />
The Dancing Harlequin has been thrust into the spotlight to deliver this simple message <br />
<em>"We must envision our new world, together, to assure it coming to us. To assist in this transition I have agreed to put forth certain ideas that can serve as a base vision to get all of us moving in the same direction."</em>  <br />
I have thrown the I Ching<br />
interestingly this is what they say: <br />
<br />
This is an important Convergence, and you must be part of it.<br />
Look for the Center of this convergence.<br />
Like waters running to the sea, like an astronomical convergence of planets revolving around the sun, you should let the gravity of this Center draw you near.<br />
Others are also drawn to this Center, and among them you will find shared bonds and kindred spirits.<br />
This tribal convergence will give you a clarity of purpose.<br />
You will no longer be alone<br />
<br />
A thunderbolt of Cosmic judgement crashes to earth.<br />
For the common person, it's just a momentary fright soon forgotten, its warning unfathomed and unheeded.<br />
But to one who understands its significance, this thunder is a signal to repent.<br />
Centering the Self, seeking balance, the enlightened person will respect and align himself with this Higher Power, while his fellows remain subject to the whims of every passing storm.<br />
<br />
The Mind of a Conspiracy Theorist sees the Cultural Evolution borne of those that look behind the curtain and seek to discover the truth and the center of this modern world of madness.  <i><br />
</i><br />
When the Mind of a Conspiracy Theorist looks at the world the heart breaks, realizes that this shamble will never be fixed and chooses to take the good from this experience and move only those things forward that serve the greater vision. <br />
<br />
 I see many speaking on these topics but I don't see any art about it.<br />

    	<h3 class="sf_blog_posttitle"><a href="http://theevolutionmovement.com/2010/03/28/man-rises-is-a-true-story.aspx">What is the Evolution Movement? <span class="readlink"></span></a></h3>
    	<div class="sf_blog_entry">
    		<p style="margin: 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: arial;">Man's purpose in this Universe is to create ideas.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: arial;">  <br />
<br />
The Evolution Movement is about man fast becoming (or becoming aware of) his role as a conscious creator. <br />
<br />
We have moved beyond Darwinism into A Purposeful Universe.  It is time to take responsibility of being conscious creators very seriously.  We have advanced beyond a reality that is not of our choice and have  taken control of "As Above So Below" as it <strong>becomes an axiom we can actively determine</strong>.  <br />
<br />
Now that we can see the controlling forces of "man behind the curtain” this game ends and it's time to consciously determine where we go from here. It is important that not only do we realize that we have a choice of what our future can look like, but also that we <em>must choose</em>.  Our power lies in our <em>choice</em>. We have been led to believe that we are powerless to change the reality of this planet.  To do this we must no longer allow the leaders of old society to comment on what we need for the new society.  <br />
<br />
We must remember as we create, <strong>the highest vision  for all is the one we should be seeking</strong>. We must dream big ! Science and technology are combining with nature and spirit to show us what true balance in our world can be. The prejudice of science and the prejudice of religion must now become a thing of the past. <br />
<br />
It is important we begin to share the same voice. We have chosen many fine voices in the past, Martin Luther King, Jesus, Einstein, and Michelangelo.  Our time has come to develop a new voice one in which we collectively decide our future. <br />
<br />
Perhaps using <em>Interactive Internet </em>we can intend to create a vision, added to by all interested parties, of the New Earth. This interactive art withdraws our energy from the existing structures (politics of tha day anyone?) and concentrates our energy on what our choices could and should be.<br />
<br />
If we were to experiment, as beings, and pick a vision we all started talking about, thinking about, getting around, pulling energy towards it, what would the vision look like?  This is what I see: <br />
<br />
High Ethical Code of Conduct- in other words the lies and corruption must go.<br />
Seekers of Truth- esch individual must get to the bottom of it. <br />
Technologically advanced but Artists at heart.<br />
Keepers of the Garden- We need  to respect the Earth as the Indians did. <br />
A healthy body is required throughout the whole body of society.<br />
64 strands of DNA are activated, we are multi-dimensional at last!<br />
We adopt the designs of Jacque Fresco and <a href="http://www.thevenusproject.com">The Venus Project </a> as our first step towards new buildings, transportation, energy and agricultural formats.<br />
The formula for Omega Energy is on the planet. Made from nothing but water, hydrogen and oxygen this swirling powers as transformed our world into a wireless marvel of clean, free energy. <br />
A resource based economy building things to last from materials that are plentiful and renewable. .<br />
<br />
The old structures of society shrivel and die as we withdraw our energy, the energy that at this time  sustains them. Like the Wicked Witch of the West they scream "I'm Melting" as they pool into nothingness, gone forever...</span><em>                                                                                       <br />

<br />
Apotheosis is the word which descibes man becoming divine.  This idea  may be a turn off to many as they   <strong>A.</strong> don't believe in any divinity and see Man as an accident in a chaotic universe   or <strong>B</strong>.   believe that Divinity is reserved for only those deemed to be God.    I believe that we live in a Universe in which the creation of novelty is the prime directive.  Man is the only inhabitant upon this planet that creates art. Due to this, man would be the highest expression of novelty on this planet.   <br />
<br />
The video is a small compilation of The Language of Light, the first act of my three act show. I am happy to report that I am getting some fast and furious ideas for Act Two and Three after being very dormant on the subject for the past two years. I am hoping to produce with the final two acts and realize Act One more completely this September.  The show essentially describes Man's inner light and sacred responsibility for his own sovereignty.  This self-empowerment will be the ultimate tipping point towards the new world, one without "power over", war or the energy of money.<br />

    	<div class="sf_blog_entry">
    		<a href="http://www.thevenusproject.com">The Venus Project</a>  popped up on my radar today. Created by Jacque Fresco and his partner Roxanne Meadows, The Venus Project   is a new way to model our culture and society on the basic notion that MAN is important and we ARE intelligent and WE CAN build a better world where EVERYONE has food, shelter and basic supplies. A society not based on the energy of money or human labor but on technology and available resources.  A major component is that the human body is not healthy unless all of the cells in the body are healthy.  Extrapolate this out to the human population not being healthy unless the whole of the population is healthy.  <br />
<br />
The Venus Project  is a fully conceived idea of human society in the next phase of our evolution. Man is free to do what he was designed to do within our universe- Create Ideas.  This idea of a society gives those of us that feel helpless within the current paradigm a tangible vision of what we could be doing, how we could be living and within this, what beings we are becoming.  The Venus Project and it's activist arm The Zeitgeist Movement are positive steps towards educating the population about what is possible if we would only give our energy to making this happen.<br /><p><span class="chicklet_group"></span></p>

    		&nbsp;I am a suburban housewife who believes that there is an evolutionary trend happening, scientifically proven, that will forever change Man's consciousness. <BR><BR>To this end,&nbsp;I am planning to&nbsp;put myself in the best possible position to adapt quickly to the new trends and wake up enough to be master&nbsp;of my destiny. To&nbsp;accomplish this&nbsp;I am going on a four week guided cleanse and plan to use the time I am cleansing connecting deeper to my intuition and higher self.&nbsp; A cleanse may be the physical way for me to traverse the gap and begin to experience my power.&nbsp; Without fully engaging my body in this ascension process&nbsp;I may miss things I am supposed to know, places I need to be, people I am intended to meet.&nbsp; All things must be used to their ultimate electrical and magnetic frequency. This for me means that I need to zero the toxin levels and start with a fresh landscape on a cellular level. I will be my own scientific/spiritual experience.&nbsp; This&nbsp;cleanse will hopefully equate my physical experiences with my spiritual experiences and drive me further down the "road" than I could have expected to get in my present condition.&nbsp; <BR><BR>I believe I have the truth about light and dark and how the evolutionary process is molding and shaping us humans into becoming humane.&nbsp; I am beginning to see what is meant&nbsp;by we are allowed to create our futures. Things are manifesting my friends- be clear on nothing but yourself and you'll be fine. Forget giving your energy to the old structures.&nbsp; Forget supporting left or right, right or wrong.&nbsp; Just know yourself, and dig deep. <BR><BR>I think that this cleanse may be&nbsp;a step for me to literally prepare for the chemical wedding, the moment of blood lightning.&nbsp; <BR><BR>I am reading a fascinating article by a dude that is so in tune, so right on, I felt finally! Here is my community!<BR>Check out&nbsp;the exploration of William&nbsp;Mistele in the planetary spheres <A href="http://www.hermeticresearch.org/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=73">HERE</A>. He is a wonderful writer and an extraordinary mystic.&nbsp; I long for the experiences this type of Mystic has- I am no where near this type of consciousness, however he sets the dream of what could be with a very high watermark.<p><span class="chicklet_group"></span></p>

    		Am I the only one that felt a definitive shift last night when the numbers changed? It really was not until about 1 AM but I relly felt something new rushing in. A remembrance of what I have been through and why. The remorse and self loathing, the unbalanced feeling I had been having for about 4 months has finally begun to move out. Yeah!<BR><BR>The positive and negative forces that inhabit creation are getting ready to stop - the end of creation is near at hand. This does mean that the creation itself ends- just that the evolutionary path in this dimension will end. The evolutionary forces are coming to an end.<BR><BR><FONT size=2>Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of what we are discovering and realizing about ourselves and our reality. By this I refer to the Mayan&nbsp;Calendar and Dr. Callemans incredible new book- </FONT><A href="http://www.amazon.com/Mayan-Calendar-Transformation-Consciousness/dp/1591430283/ref=pd_rhf_shvl_1"><FONT size=2>The Purposeful Universe</FONT></A><FONT size=2>.&nbsp; It's an amazing thesis that puts Darwinism to shame and essentially proves that the universe has been created by intelligent design.&nbsp;The argument for Darwinism is an argument that keeps man in slavery and stupidity.&nbsp; Imagine how different our culture would be if Man was taught from a young age that our Universe was not a random, accidental event, but a purposeful, intentional one? Would our species not have more respect for one another and the planet we live on?&nbsp; I am not purporting&nbsp;a belief in religion to also believe in an intelligent universe, I am saying that we would naturally have more self respect and self love if we had been allowed to believe in the science of design rather than the science of natural selection.&nbsp; There is a huge argument in scientific circles about even discussing the idea that Darwinism may not be the way evolution happened.&nbsp; Teaching&nbsp;careers have been destroyed by&nbsp;simply allowing a discussion of Intelligent Design into their classroom. How's that for an open minded society that wants to evolve? Not so good. <BR><BR>Why is there is so much fear mongering? In my mind it is because "fear controls". &nbsp;Fear of terrorists, fear of global warming, fear of no health care all put those that say they are fixing these things for "your own good" into positions of more and more power and us, the beautiful beings that were created <STRONG>on purpose </STRONG>on this planet, into slavery and self loathing. <BR><BR>Discovery of man's great deception is on the brink of mass realization and awakening. I am personally grateful to the obvious and overt nature of our government to make sure we all see how corrupt and despicable they are to help us with this awakening process.&nbsp; I find it laughable those that still consider there to be a "left and a right" in this country when there is really an US and a THEM.<BR><BR>On a similar note, I recently discovered what the true meaning of the Samhain is- a deeply mystical and self-relevatory day on our calendar. It once was held as highly sacred, now it is deduced to a "drinking" holiday celebrating nothing less than the evil on the planet.&nbsp; The Soltice as well was a time when one was to self-relect and take stock of one's soul, now it's hurry to the mall time&nbsp;and fill our time with&nbsp;TV shows like "<EM>Christmas in the </EM><EM>White House</EM>."&nbsp; I am hoping that this evolution, as it comes to pass over the next 2 years, will be a time of joyous awakening and utter rebelliion against those that seek to enslave us.&nbsp; <BR><BR><EM>We have nothing to say against the men of science, we have nothing to say against the great Mystics --- all hail to both! But such of their followers who accepted the doctrines of either the one or the other as a dogma we here openly pronounce to be a bane, a curse, and a pestilence to mankind.&nbsp; - Aleister Crowley</EM></FONT><BR><p><span class="chicklet_group"></span></p>
