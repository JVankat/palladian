<p>I normally dont post multiple times in one evening, but lots has happened in the last hour.  I must say, the Kentucky news media is abuzz about the <strong>Cats Pause story tonight that Billy Donovan and UK have reached a deal</strong> that will make Donovan the new coach at Kentucky.  The news has been reported on WAVE in Louisville, WLEX in Lexington (which went with the story at 11, the same time the Cats Pause report came out, suggesting it was intentional) and is now common knowledge.  We here at Kentucky Sports Radio have found out that the folks at Florida, including the Athletic Director have been made aware of the story and it is now will become the top talk of tomorrow&#8217;s sports day.</p>
<p>The question is whether this is good.  From now until Monday, <strong>Billy Donovan will be forced to answer questions on the subject from not only the news media, but also likely his team and the university</strong>.  What was before today a &#8220;wait until the season is over&#8221; story has now, thanks to the Darrell Bird story, become a &#8220;we have to ask you now&#8221; story.  When you say a deal is done, folks want to know if the deal is done.  That means that Billy Donovan and the Florida Gators are in for distractions aplenty.</p>
<p><strong>Will these distractions turn Billy Donovan against UK</strong>?  One hopes not&#8230;..but I think all involved, including the UK folks wish that if the story is true (which may still be a big if, who knows?), it had not gotten out at this point.  Everyone&#8217;s interests were served if the story hadnt been released.  UK gets its coach&#8230;.Florida gets a chance at a second championship&#8230;.Billy Donovan avoids distractions.  What about now?  The story is out&#8230;&#8230;but will UK and its possible new coach pay the price?  Only time will tell&#8230;&#8230;</p>

            <p>this is so crazy, even when i heard the story on the news i was skeptical.  So many rumors have made me so.  But good lord, i cant wait to see what happens tomorrow.</p>

            <p>My thoughts exactly. I want Donovan as bad as the next guy, but I have a feeling this could end up hurting the reputation of both Billy and this university.</p>

            <p>Its a major stupid move, but the bell cannot be unwrung. It&#8217;s amazing how everyone has to try to &#8220;OUT-SCOOP&#8221; the others without thinking things through clearly.</p>

            <p>It was a helluva scoop if he lands it, though, and well worth it in the end, if you think about it. As negative as the flip side would be &#8230; TCP outscooped everyone and became legendary tonight.</p>

            <p>I don&#8217;t think there is any doubt the media screwed up.  Even if true, it obviously was to be kept quiet.  It may backfire on us and kill the deal (if it really existed) in order to allow Billy to win his title&#8230;&#8230;</p>

            <p>Somebody correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but it looks like what happened is (1) TCP reports that a specific deal has been offered but not signed; (2) WLEX then relies on TCP to report that &#8220;a package is in place&#8221; (a somewhat confusing way to say that an offer has been made); and then WAVE and other outlets interpret this (incorrectly) as meaning that a deal has been finalized.  All of this would seem to suggest both bad judgment by TCP and bad reporting by WAVE and others.  At the end of the day, however, I don&#8217;t think that the deal would unravel over this &#8212; but who knows?</p>

            <p>1) This isnt the online fans fault. The blame will fall squarely on the shoulders of one Darrell Bird of the Cats Paws.</p>

            <p>I wish the story had stayed under wraps. It is got to be very unfair to the Florida team. The only good thing is that most of the stars are probably leaving anyway, so BD staying or going would not impact them too much.</p>

            <p>Darrell Bird wrote the deal was done, then edittted his post after. all media read his first story which was on the frnt page and likned to message board. once again, Darrell Bird reported it as fact, than editted it too late. he&#8217;s in deep doodoo but what does he care, he just got more money than god in one night.</p>

            <p>Sportcenter just talked about how great of a coaching spot Arkansas is. Top 10 they said. Other than UK, it is the best place for a basketball school in the SEC where other schools are more football. I think Donovan really needs to hear the absence of Florida in that conversation.</p>

            <p>It all depends on who leaked it and why.</p>
<p>Possibilities raised here and elsewhere:</p>
<p>Leaked by Billy&#8217;s agent to drive up his price at Florida.</p>
<p>Leaked by UK/Billy to alert PP and JL (and NC) that they can go ahead and commit.</p>
<p>Leaked by some idiot</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s possible the Florida players know he&#8217;s leaving, though one wouldn&#8217;t expect it given their comments. </p>
<p>Then again, as best we can tell, our guys didn&#8217;t know Tubby was really gone until they heard he was on a plane (Woo at least seemed to say Tubby said he was going to interview - which is different from going to sign a contract).</p>
<p>I just hope it&#8217;s true, Billy&#8217;s cool with it, and if not, 24,000 people in blue and white screaming his name in Rupp will be enough to soothe his irritation away.</p>

            <p>WHY WOULD THIS CHANGE ANYTHING?  At worst, a local television station (or two) misinterpreted a rumor from an internet fansite.  Big deal.  Billy can continue to refuse to answer questions about the UK job and state that he is intent on preparing for UCLA.  If the deal had come this far, then his players either alreay knew (likely) or he has been lying to them all along (so why would he stop now?).  It is also possible that the leak was intentional.  So what would be the rationale for him backing out of an already done deal because of this?  I just don&#8217;t see it.</p>

<p>What if Donovan isn&#8217;t coming?  What if he knows that he can string us along for a week or two and in the meantime, let all the top candidates either sign somewhere else or sign extensions?  Maybe he knows that he can maintain an advantage over his most heated rival by swaying the coaching decision?</p>

            <p>I think everyone needs to relax, if Billy wants to come then it is<br />
done deal. His players are totally focused on the job at hand.<br />
I am somewhat surprised Darrell posted it. I am not sure about the<br />
edit, and what he edited out, but he did have in the lead that it<br />
was a rumor of a done deal. But with Darrell posting it, gave the<br />
story great credibility. If it does&#8217;nt work out UK will get a good<br />
coach. Billy is my first choice, and John Pelphrey my second. So<br />
I am not worried. Go Cats!</p>

ESPN, the National Enquirer of Sports, will have their male equivalent shows to Oprah and Maury<br />

<p>I do:<br />
<a href="http://ncaafootball.aolsportsblog.com/2006/12/08/breaking-news-rich-rodriguez-officially-alabamas-new-coach/" rel="nofollow">http://ncaafootball.aolsportsblog.com/2006/12/08/breaking-news-rich-ro driguez-officially-alabamas-new-coach/</a></p>
<p>More so than Billy, I really hope this doesn&#8217;t distract the team. If you guys were meant to get Billy then it was meant to be. However, it&#8217;s not fair for a 3rd party to throw extra pressure on a team that already had a million story lines.</p>

            <p>This entire done deal was nothing more than to sell suscriptions to the premium content by the Cats pause.  as a non subscriber i clicked on the the thread by D Bird at the top of the forum topics list to read:  &#8220;You know the names of all the coaches being bandied about as Kentucky&#8217;s new basketball coach. Now come inside the House of Blue for information about a potential blockbuster deal that &#8220;could&#8221; rock college basketball coast to coast.&#8221;  The KEY word there is COULD.  It is a &#8220;come on sign up&#8221; ploy thatt I think will backfire.</p>

            <p>What if&#8230; Billy&#8217;s agent told him the details of the deal, they both agree it&#8217;s good to pass up, and the agent tells MB on Friday that they&#8217;ll sign after the final four.</p>
<p>Calapari inquires, finds out the job is not open on Sat&#8230; goes on to sign contract extension on Sun.</p>
<p>Gillespi is informed the job has been filled, talks to Arkansas and accepts that job.</p>
<p>Billy D thinks about what he needs and realizes he has to get Patterson.  Since he can&#8217;t come flat out and say that he&#8217;s coming to UK, he asks his agent and they agree that leaking it will help steer PPat an dLUCAS all the while Billy can keep taking the &#8220;I can&#8217;t comment on that&#8221; approach.  Then after the final four, he can say that UK was just working up the proposal and he didn&#8217;t see it til after the final four.  When he accepted it.</p>

            <p>Relax folks. This wasn&#8217;t simply a rumor that was spread around. This was an intentional leak. BTW, there has been a new Tuesday article that came out in one of the Florida newspapers where some of the players were acknowledging that Donovan might leave. Noah was quoted as saying &#8220;he wouldn&#8217;t judge the guy and knows he has a decision to make just like he does&#8221;. If you ask me, that&#8217;s a big shift in the attitude of the UF players. IMHO, they were informed within the past 24 hours that Billy would be coming to UK next season. Then after all the need to know people were let in on the deal, the story was leaked on purpose for a variety of purposes, one of which is recruiting.</p>

            <p>The very fact that Kentucky fans are obsessed with getting a coach from Florida is in and of itself a major statement as to the relative statures of the two programs.  The Kentucky &#8220;faithful&#8221; are so desperate to stem tha tide of their obscurity that they will pin all of their hopes on a resurgance on getting a coach to defect from a program that they say is at the bottom of the heap as far as basketball meccas are concerned.  How ironic!!!  You want a coach to leave a bush league program because you think he is a great coach.  Well why do you think he is a great coach if he still is at a bush league program?</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t have it both ways.  You want Billy because Kentucy stands in the shadow of Florida basketball right now, and it eats your collective hearts out.  Even if he doesn&#8217;t ressurect your program, you all would be happy to see our program presumably suffer because of such a completely inexplicable action on the part of Donovan.  It&#8217;s the old, &#8220;if we can&#8217;t win we are going to make darn sure you don&#8217;t either.&#8221;  What a bunch of losers.</p>

            <p>This guy made a good point on TCP:</p>
<p>JHB4UK<br />
For those saying &#8220;hey what&#8217;s the big deal, this won&#8217;t hurt anything!&#8221; obviously don&#8217;t know your recent history of how things like this can get screwed up thanks to the media.</p>
<p>November 2003: Auburn officials meet secretly with UL coach Bobby Petrino at an Indiana airfield, an agreement is met that Petrino will replace Tommy Tubberville at seasons conclusion. Unfortunately for them Alabama journalist Paul Finebaum has been tracking the Auburn private plane and discovers the meeting. The resulting media firestorm forces Petrino to BACK OFF and say he is committed to staying at UL (for the time being).</p>

            <p>&#8220;It would be a huge disapointment if UK fans online were once again the downfall of something positive for UK…&#8221;</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t blame UK fans, you can only blame TCP, the same website that continuously banned posters for being anti-Tubby.  I really think they MAY have just cost us a legit shot at Billy D.  How freaking stupid are some people.  It&#8217;s almost as if they want this deal to fail!</p>

            <p>One thing is clear.  Yesterday, and for the last few days in fact, the same story has been leaking like a sieve from everyone connected to UK.  I&#8217;ve personally heard the same &#8220;it&#8217;s a done deal&#8221; line from multiple sources, and I&#8217;m not connected at all.  So I&#8217;m sure that pretty much the majority of the state has been hearing this.  It&#8217;s the worst-kept secret in history.</p>

            <p>Let me get this straight&#8230; most of you have been scouring the message boards hoping that a story like this breaks. When it does, you complain that it should&#8217;ve been kept quiet? This rumor has been going around since this past weekend. The Cat&#8217;s Pause CLEARLY stated that Billy hadn&#8217;t signed anything and this wasn&#8217;t coming from UK officials - before the edits. If a news station misreported it, too bad. </p>
<p>People are severely overreacting to this leak of info. Severely.</p>
<p>Be happy, it looks like we got our man!</p>

            <p>You guys  are completely delusional for thinking this could happen and for thinking that it might now not happen because it was leaked.  Kentucky has nothing to offer Billy that he can&#8217;t get at Florida but a bunch of hillbillies with no teeth.  Billy is from NY.  We don&#8217;t like Hillbillies with no teeth.  Trust me.  That is not a rumor.  We really don&#8217;t.</p>

Then he wanted to be close to UK so bad that he takes a job at Loserville!  So your ignorant comment makes no sense.  UK has WAY more to offer than Florida.  Fans, money, best facilities in the nation.  You are an idiot.</p>

            <p>There is more at stake here than money. He will be highly paid and highly successful where ever he is.<br />
The difference is the seven banners in RUPP&#8217;s rafters and the tradition. Billy has  big ego and we all know how he would be<br />
deified even more so than Pitino was. I predict that if he does come we will be in the FF in 2 years. His charisma<br />
and the tradition of UK will make us the recruiting jewel we once were.</p>

&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Everybody knows somebody who knows somebody associated with the UK<br />
&gt;&gt; Basketball program. We&#8217;ve all had the &#8220;inside&#8221; scoop. But I can tell you<br />
&gt;&gt; inequitably this information has been privy to less than 10 people<br />
&gt;&gt; within<br />
&gt;&gt; the entire UK program including major boosters (advertisers who spend<br />
&gt;&gt; the<br />
&gt;&gt; dollars that make UK what it is). You can guess who these boosters<br />
&gt;&gt; are&#8230;they all know each other well, belong to a prestigious golf course<br />
&gt;&gt; in<br />
&gt;&gt; Tampa, and make trips there every quarter to get together. They also<br />
&gt;&gt; make<br />
&gt;&gt; frequent trips to Mons Venus&#8230; a gentlemen&#8217;s club in Tampa.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Pitino is also part of this group.<br />
&gt;&gt; Rick has made it known over the last couple of years that U of L would<br />
&gt;&gt; not<br />
&gt;&gt; be his final stop on his coaching tour. He has always said he made a<br />
&gt;&gt; mistake in leaving the UK program. He has stated privately to those in<br />
&gt;&gt; power at UK of his desire to return if ever given the opportunity. He<br />
&gt;&gt; was<br />
&gt;&gt; emphatic in stating the importance of controlling any changes in a<br />
&gt;&gt; manner<br />
&gt;&gt; that did not hurt the &#8220;existing&#8221; coach. Timing was the single most<br />
&gt;&gt; critical<br />
&gt;&gt; element in any move. He has had difficulty in developing the atmosphere<br />
&gt;&gt; at<br />
&gt;&gt; UL like he achieved at UK. Has been pissed off, especially this year,<br />
&gt;&gt; when<br />
&gt;&gt; the U of L faithful have doubted his abilities and direction he was<br />
&gt;&gt; leading<br />
&gt;&gt; the program (he did not go to 3 call in shows during the year due to<br />
&gt;&gt; what<br />
&gt;&gt; he referred to as ignorant U of L fickle fans). He recognized that deep<br />
&gt;&gt; down, the UL fan base would turn on him with one bad move (referencing<br />
&gt;&gt; that<br />
&gt;&gt; he came from their hated rival and knew deep down he was never loved<br />
&gt;&gt; like<br />
&gt;&gt; he was in UK).<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; A good friend of mine, has traveled to Saratoga with this group (and<br />
&gt;&gt; Pitino) and has also traveled to Tampa. He got a call last night&#8230;and<br />
&gt;&gt; said<br />
&gt;&gt; the deal has been made, the offer has been accepted and that Rick Pitino<br />
&gt;&gt; will be returning to coach at the University of Kentucky. He is bringing<br />
&gt;&gt; his son, who is an assistant at an east coast small school as well as<br />
&gt;&gt; Derek<br />
&gt;&gt; Anderson and Rex Chapman.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; The announcement will be made on Saturday the day of the Final Four.<br />
&gt;&gt; This contact of mine was right on target when he told me 3 weeks ago<br />
&gt;&gt; that<br />
&gt;&gt; Tubby would not return next year to coach UK. No way. He also has been<br />
&gt;&gt; correct on other changes that were made&#8230;Rich Brooks, Ron Hudson in<br />
&gt;&gt; football to name a couple.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Right it down.<br />
&gt;&gt; GO BIG BLUE!<br />

<p>TRUE BLUE COVERAGE<br />
Report: UK Ready To Name Donovan</p>
<p>March 27, 2007 09:37 AM EDT </p>
<p>According to Darrell Bird of CatsPause.com, UK is poised to name Billy Donovan its new basketball coach after Florida&#8217;s final game in the NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>According to CatsPause.com, the reported package is a seven year deal worth $3.5 million per year. The report further states there is a $3.5 million loyalty bonus if Donovan completes all  seven years. </p>
<p>The deal reportedly was made last Thursday and Friday during a meeting with Donovan&#8217;s agent here in Lexington.</p>
<p>Bird writes on CatsPause.com, &#8220;Numerous attempts to verify a rumor through independent sources have all reached the same conclusion.  Kentucky is poised to name Billy Donovan its new basketball coach shortly after Florida&#8217;s final game in the NCAA tournament.&#8221;</p>

            <p>This is the perfect opportunity to comment on this behavioral phenomenon.  How often do men criticize women for taking a little info or a hunch and then expand it into a huge story of unequivocal truth, spreading to friends and neighbors in-person and on the phone?….Oh, how women spread rumors and gossip.  Responses born completely out of emotion with no rational thought involved at all.  We look at them and call them silly for doing so.  Time to look in the mirror guys.</p>

You are in the minority though&#8230; BD was #1 choice of fans, RP was #2.<br />
 Seems most fans have enough sense to realize htat RO couldn&#8217;t come to UK at the time, so he took the second best Kentucky position..</p>

            <p>128) Nice blanket, sexist generalization.</p>
<p>129) Do you think WLEX and Wave are run by teenagers? </p>
<p>We all know it&#8217;s rumor, but we also all know that this rumor in particular has had a lot of people swearing by it, and the object of it certainly hasn&#8217;t done anything to suggest it&#8217;s not possible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rumor because a contract can&#8217;t be signed while Billy is still working at Florida. But just because it&#8217;s a rumor, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not credible.</p>

            <p>Also, to all of you more mature, older posters who hate Rick as a traitor, can I just point out how immature it is of you to dislike a coach because of his choice to return to a rival (remember, our job was not open, so it&#8217;s not like he snubbed us), as compared to disliking him for his conduct while our coach, including the whole cheerleader incident?</p>

            <p>Han, I was speaking of most posters on boards&#8230;Wlex et all, IMHO, jumped the gun cause it IS just rumor and you dont&#8217; report rumor as truth. People on Message boards take said rumors and run with them, getting too excited.. they need to calm down and wait and see. Rumors may turn out to be true, but the could just as equally turn out to be nothing..better to stay calm and keep your respect rather than go all crazy and look like a fool.</p>

            <p>137) All but the most fanatical posters know that even if this is legit (and we&#8217;re hoping), it can still fall through up until Billy D signs on the dotted line.</p>
<p>Many of us simply saw an official acknowledgment on a pay site as something more substantial than all of the &#8220;I know a guy&#8221; posts on the boards. Why? Because when one of the pay sites posts something like this, they have a hell of a lot to lose if they end up looking like an idiot.</p>

<p>Are you telling me that if Donovan turned us down, you&#8217;d rather have someone like Crean or Ford, right now, than Rick Pitino?</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said - the headlines alone would be worth it.</p>
<p>No matter who we get, some people will be upset, and many of you fools will make ultimatums about never rooting for UK again. But it&#8217;s simply a fact that most of the fans, including the average sports bar fans that the news stations find, have Rick as their #2 pick. If that&#8217;s the case (and these aren&#8217;t all kids who don&#8217;t remember &#8220;what he did&#8221;), then I think he would be forgiven if he came back.</p>

 I understand that, and don&#8217;t disagree&#8230; I was talkign more of the ones that saw it, then ran to all the boards posting it like it was 100% done!! Even the original, before edit, stressed that it was not confirmed with ANY UK official.

The man who goes to every Florida game, most practices.  Sat around Tubby Smith&#8217;s office when Billy was an assistant at UK cause Tubby befriended him.  Almost a stage parent.

            <p>I used to negotiate contracts.  Billy&#8217;s agent has gotten the best offer possible and has been speaking with UK - of that I&#8217;m absolutely certain.  I&#8217;m also equally certain Billy hasn&#8217;t directly commented to UK in any capacity, signed anything, or promised to do anything.  It would be ethically wrong on a lot of levels for him to do that and that isn&#8217;t how you want to deal with your potential future employer - plus Florida will get the right of first refusal and will make a counter offer.  This whole rumor is bogus.  Yeah UK has talked with Donovans agent and made an offer.  So what.  He is the programs first choice and after the final four I&#8217;m sure Billy will deal with it.  That&#8217;s how this stuff works and even if Billy plans on staying at Florida he isn&#8217;t going to say that b/c he wants to wring every last dollar out of them.  Florida will be sweating his decision until he makes an announcement and will be forced to make a top $ offer as a result.</p>
<p>I feel pretty certain that Mark Few&#8217;s agent will have been contacted as well but no one is talking about that&#8230;.</p>

            <p>136.  If people want to dislike Pitino b/c he went to out most heated rival I&#8217;m not really sure where you can find fault with that.  Maybe you don&#8217;t feel that way (and that&#8217;s fine - whatever you know) but hopefully you can understand why a vast majority of people would feel betrayed.  Just b/c people don&#8217;t agree with you does&#8217;t make them immature - you are implying that other peoples comphrehension of the situation is somehow less than yours.</p>

<p>As much of a UK fan that i am, and how much morris in a sense won a couple of games for us&#8230;I HATE how he plays&#8230;without any emotion. It was tied up in the nova game, towards the end, and morris was sitting on the bench chewing on a piece of gum with a towel over his head. He could have cared less about anything.</p>

            <p>145 nailed it. It makes no sense that a deal has been reached, not enough time has passed(I may not feel that way had UF not played this past weekend). UF wouldn&#8217;t have had time to put a counter proposal on the table. Secondly, there&#8217;s no way on God&#8217;s green earth that a successful deal could be held secret for a week(now through the FF). Let&#8217;s hope it works in our favor.</p>

            <p>150) My point was that most people who don&#8217;t want Pitino back say so because he betrayed us by going to a rival. My point is that a) he didn&#8217;t leave us to go to a rival, and b) most people still seem to prefer him over anyone except Billy D.</p>
<p>Many of the same people who feel betrayed by Rick like to play the &#8220;less mature&#8221; or &#8220;less knowledgeable&#8221; card against those of us who would take Rick back. My point to those folks is that if you&#8217;re gonna dislike Rick, it would be more appropriate to dislike him for some of the things he got away with while here, not for foolishly going to Little Brother as the next best thing to coming home.</p>
<p>My point was that it seems that most people would &#8220;forgive&#8221; Pitino for foolishly going to Louisville (from what I recall, the only other job thought to be open to him was UNLV), and even if they wouldn&#8217;t forgive him, it&#8217;s arguably childish to hold that move against him while overlooking some inappropriate behavior arguably more serious.</p>

            <p>#156, Pitino all but signed on the dotted line to go to Michigan, then the Louisville job comes open and he jumps all over it.  He could have taken that job, which has a ton more tradition and recruiting power than Little Brother.  It doesnt matter the personal reason he took the Loserville job, he took it, and stabbed the UK faithful in the back.  I would have cared less if he went to Michigan, but to come to Loserville?  That shows what an egotistical piece of crap that he is.  Some people like him and that is their business.  To me, and to a lot of other KY fans he is not welcome here.  I personally would not be a UK fan any longer if they where to hire him.  But, that doesnt really matter, because the job offer will not go out to him.</p>

            <p>I think it is pretty clear damage control is underway in certain athletic departments. This was a shameful, thoughtless announcement from Darrell Bird. What was this guy thinking? Rumors are fun to discuss, but they also get out of hand causing widespread chaos. We will know soon enough who will be our basketball coach. In the meantime, we have a nationally ranked baseball team with championship aspirations and a spring football practice where there is actually optimism with a quarterback that could be the SEC&#8217;s best this fall. I don&#8217;t know about the rest of you, but I am pretty amazed our athletic director has resurrected two essentially dead college sports to competing for championships and bowl games.</p>

            <p>Bernie Machen (UF President) basically opened up the checkbook for Dononvan.  In the end, there will be no financial incentive for him to come to UK.  UF, a much larger school with a much larger budget, has the resources to counter and beat any offer from UK.  University presidents are ego driven individuals also.  When one makes a guarantee, as Machen did, he will do anything in his power to keep Donovan.  Machen does not want any egg on his face.  If Billy gets away, Machen&#8217;s credibility takes a huge hit.  Whatever Billy wants now, Billy gets and he will have indefinitely.  Billy is playing this perfectly.  If he makes any statement of commitment now, he gives away all his chips.  Right now, everyone is playing right into his hands and he is holding all the chips.  Remember who Billy&#8217;s mentor was.  Not saying it can&#8217;t happen, but any advantage financially UK has over most other schools, won&#8217;t be a factor here.</p>

            <p>Katz hasn&#8217;t spoken to Donovan about it, at least not AFTER the season, Truth be told, Billy D prolly doesn&#8217;t know what he will do yet&#8230;he definately isn&#8217;t going to talk to a reporter about it right now</p>

            <p>Andy Katz just repeats second and third hand stuff he has heard and doesn&#8217;t really understand much about basketball.  For my money him and Luke Winn are the two worst basketball analysts at a major sport news outlet.  Luke Winn at least tries to digest what the other talkings heads say and formulate his own opinion but just ends up wrong a lot.  That being said there is a chance Donovan won&#8217;t end up at UK but I can gurantee you he won&#8217;t end his career at Florida.  He&#8217;s going to leave at some point and if he wins another championship this year he will never get a better chance to parlay that success into finanical/carreer gain.</p>

            <p>173 I think you are dead wrong. UK does have an advatage in that UK does not have a football coach (at a football school) making more and expecting more than the basketball coach. UK can pay 3.5 to 4 million to a coach without raising the football coaches salary. I don&#8217;t think even Florida wants to spend upwards of 8 million per year for two sports. Foley can keep Myer at what he makes, let Donovan go and spend 2-2.5 million on another top name.</p>

            <p>Nuke99, University presidents are politicians.  They accumulate and spend political capital.  If Donovan gets away for financial reasons, Machen takes a huge hit.  Right now, he is telling Jeremy Foley &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how you maket happen, just do it.&#8221;</p>

            <p>175. </p>
<p>How is Katz&#8217;s info any different than that of Mr. Darrell Bird? </p>
<p>I worked for a newspaper and now work as an intern (while in law school) for a SID office at a D-I school in Ohio. They have a pfairly decent basketball program and a prominent site.</p>
<p>You what sources Mr. Bird has in the athletic department? Guys like me. An intern in the SID office who hears information and rumors second hand. </p>
<p>The problem is you UK fans choose to belive info that is rumored and negate info that has some factual background.</p>
<p>When a guy like Andy Katz says on National TV, I talked to Billy Donovan&#8217;s dad (who is on the bench for near every UF game) he probably talked to Billy&#8217;s Dad.</p>
<p>When a guy like Darrell Bird says &#8220;I heard a rumor I couldn&#8217;t disprove&#8221; he&#8217;s probably got some 2nd/3rd hand information that really has not factual background other than the fact that it can attract a few more subscribers.</p>
<p>Unlike Andy Katz, who receives a salary no matter what information he states, Mr. Bird is dependent on subscribers to make him money. Now tell me. Looking at it rationally. Who is more trustworthy?</p>

            <p>I don&#8217;t see Fl paying him more than the Football Coach (Who currently makes a little less than $4 mil/year)<br />
to pay him $5 mil for 10 years would mean bumping football to at least $5mil, maybe even $5.5 mil Just don&#8217;t see them doing that</p>

<p>More rumors and false facts by UK fans.</p>
<p>Urban Meyer signed a contract for 14 Million over 7 years. Because the contract started at 1.7 and sloweing increased until he makes 2.3 at the end, this year he made about the same as Billy 1.8 Million.</p>

<p>Florida has paid the basketball coach MORE than the football coach since Spurrier has left. So don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re not willing to do that. If its a bidding war Florida WILL pay, as our school president said the other day.</p>

            <p>178) if that were true wouldn&#8217;t it be put on the Florida Athletic Dept. website. It is not on there as of right now. I don&#8217;t see Florida paying 4 mil a year to a coach who does not coach football. The basketball program at Florida does not make enough money to offset that type of pay. Yes they have a budget but to fund those budgets they have to bring in enough revenue. They bball team is not doing that.</p>

My math skills are fine 45/10=4.5 I know. Florida won&#8217;t pay 4,4.5 or 3.5 so does 1/2 a million really matter. The bball program has to make enough money to offset that salary.</p>

            <p>194) did you notice Florida was not in the top 20 in that report. It would be hard for them to cough up a huge sum of money for BD to stay. They may do it you never know. </p>
<p>If UK reports all of the revenue they top the list with U of Smell #2. I guess coming to a state where basketball means everything would be a dumb idea, if you listen to the ESPN boys.</p>

            <p>195) if you are referring to telling the kids he recruited he was staying that is not a lie. When he recruited them Tubby had a job and he was not considering going anywhere, and who says he is now. We don&#8217;t know but to say that is a character flaw would be off the mark. </p>
<p>Besides recruiting and all sports now a days is business. Has anyone watched the football show on MTV, they are sponsored by Nike. Little League is on ESPN for 2 weeks. All sports has turned into a business down to the lowest level. It is kind of sad if you think about it. A game that most kids play for fun has turned into all this.</p>

            <p>Its not all about the money folks. Either school is going to pay him enough to keep him happy. Here are the pros and cons of each school as I reckon them. </p>
<p>UK Pros&#8212;- Big Money<br />
            23,000 fans to a practice (Entire State Population is a fan)<br />
            Opportunity to build on UK&#8217;s legacy<br />
            Highest profile job left to Donovan short of going PRO<br />
            Better facilities (Brand spanking new 30 mill practice facility<br />
            Wildcat Lodge and 24,000 seat Rupp Arena<br />
            Ashley Judd<br />
            Fan base follows the team everywhere creating home tournament games</p>
<p>UF          Family loves Gainsville<br />
            Big Money<br />
            Opportunity to create his own legacy<br />
            Better Weather<br />
            Relationship with the AD<br />
            Been there 11 years </p>
<p>UK Cons     While passionate sometime fans are a little crazy<br />
            Pressure to win and win big<br />
            Pressure is about the only bad thing that can be said about UK </p>
<p>UF   Cons    Cant sell out a 12,000 seat arena every game<br />
             Only sold 500 tickets to NCAA tournament game<br />
             Only had 5,000 to year kick off after winning the championship<br />
             Competing interest with football and tons of pro teams<br />
             Been there 11 years<br />
             The Gator Chomp   </p>
<p>Admittedly I am UK fans but if you disagree feel free to add on to the list</p>

            <p>How sure is everyone that his family loves Gainesville? Is his wife not from Lexington? I thought he met her while he was an asst. up here. If she wants to move back home then it is a done deal. Gotta keep momma happy or no one is happy.</p>

            <p>You really cant be sure what they are thinking. No one on either side has any idea what everyone involved really thinks no matter what they say.    Thats just what we have heard so it really might not be as much of a pro as you think.</p>

            <p>Strike that. </p>
<p>Pro in 202 refers to a pro versus a con </p>
<p>Since you cant really know if hi family like Gainsville it might not be a pro for UF. It could be a con.</p>

            <p>At least Donovan hasn&#8217;t flat out said no.  Nick Saban did just that about the Alabama job, and where is he now? Coachin Bama.  He&#8217;s now hated as much as Pitino is at home.  So even if Donovan does say he&#8217;s not interested, he may still sign.</p>
