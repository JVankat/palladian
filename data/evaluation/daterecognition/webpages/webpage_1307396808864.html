 Abstract:  Dark cutting or high-pH meat is a persistent
 quality defect found in all meat species. Caused by a lack of
 normal acidification of meat during rigor development, dark-
 cutting is a direct consequence of low muscle glycogen at
 slaughter. Glycogen breakdown in muscle may be rapidly
 triggered by increased circulating adrenaline or by strenuous
 muscular activity. In addition, glycogen is slowly depleted
 during starvation. Any behaviour and environmetal
 circumstances that trigger one or more of these glycogen
 breakdown mechanisms will cause dark-cutting if the stress is
 allowed to persist for sufficient time. Mounting activity is
 the behaviour most closely associated with muscle glycogen
 depletion and dark-cutting in beef. This behaviour is
 stimulated by social regrouping, as in mixed penning of young
 bulls, and also by oestrus in groups of females. Lairage
 modifications aimed at reducing mounting activity during the
 preslaughter period have been successful. Short-haul road
 transport is not associated with dark-cutting in beef but
 there is evidence that some lambs may be affected, even by
 relatively short journeys. Long-haul road transport resulted
 in small increases in beef final pH and these may be reversed
 by resting and feeding before slaughter. Fasting did not cause
 dark-cutting in beef or lamb; however, it lowered muscle
 glycogen reserves, thus rendering an animal more susceptible
 to dark-cutting from additional sources of stress. Fasting
 also inhibited muscle glycogen resynthesis during recovery
 after stress. There is a good theoretical basis, although
 little experimental evidence, to link cold exposure with dark-
 cutting meat. The use of beta-agonists as growth promoters may
 increase the incidence of dark-cutting meat unless a
 sufficient withdrawal period before slaughter is observed.
 Rates of glycogen resynthesis are slower in ruminants than in
 monogastrics, probably due to the lower availability of
 glucose in ruminants. Although drug interventions were
 unsucces

 Abstract:  Mustering and other cattle management operations
 are a significant cost for beef producers on extensive
 properties in northern Australia. As a result, a range of
 cattle handling equipment has been developed which uses animal
 behaviour patterns to simplify some tasks. Two "animal-
 powered" devices were developed to automatically apply
 parasite control chemicals to cattle as they passed through
 one-directional spear gates. Both applicators were based on
 wheel-driven pumps, and dispensed chemicals in proportion to
 the length of contact between the device and the animal's
 body. Application rates were within 10% of existing
 recommendations for animals in the most common weight range of
 250-500 kg. The applicators were simple to install and remove,
 allowing easy transfer between sites.

 Abstract:  Twenty-seven crossbred calves (1/2 Simmental, 1/4
 Hereford, 1/4 Brahman) averaging 257 +/- 11 d of age were
 either hot-iron-branded (H), freeze-branded (F), or sham-
 branded (S). Calves were blocked for temperament, weight, and
 sex and were randomly assigned to day and order in which
 treatments were applied. To reduce stress from handling at
 treatment time, each calf was herded through the squeeze chute
 daily for 5 d before the experiment. Jugular cannulas were
 inserted in each calf 1 d before application of treatment.
 Blood samples and heart rate measures were obtained at -5, -3,
 0, .5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after application of the
 treatments. Mean concentrations of plasma epinephrine (EPI)
 were higher for H calves at time .5 min than for either S or F
 calves (P = .10). To account for individual differences,
 prebranding heart rates and hormone concentrations were
 subtracted from subsequent samples and were also used to
 calculate a proportion for each subsequent sample. Analyses of
 subtracted values found that EPI concentrations were greater
 for H calves than for either S or F calves (P = .007) at .5
 min postbranding. No other differences were found for the
 subtracted analyses. Analyses of proportion data also revealed
 that H calves had greater EPI than did either S or F calves (P
 = .027) at .5 min postbranding. Only three animals vocalized
 during branding, one H calf and two F calves. Despite the 5-d
 acclimation period, handling and restraint elevated plasma
 cortisol concentrations and heart rate. Because restraint
 elevated physiological indicators of stress, possible
 treatment differences may have been masked. The greater
 epinephrine response experienced by H calves indicates a
 higher momentary pain sensation than that experienced by
 either S or F calves.

 Abstract:  Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRDC) is an
 important disease affecting both beef and dairy cattle
 produced in confinement operations. A bioeconomic model of
 BRDC is developed for a typical Midwestern feedlot. Using
 vaccine efficacy rates found in the veterinary science
 literature, significant returns to vaccination are estimated.

 Econometric models; Slaughter
 
 Abstract:  A bioeconomic model of a feedlot was developed for
 the comparison of beef cattle genotypes under specified
 management and marketing conditions. The optimization behavior
 of commercial feedlot managers is incorporated into the model
 using optimum economic rotation theory. The days spent in the
 feedlot (rotation) by a group of animals are derived using
 this theory so as to maximize an objective function.
 Differences among breeds in the present value of profits from
 a single rotation, expressed per animal, represent the
 expected price premium paid for a feeder animal of a
 particular breed. Feed requirements and growth rates for a
 genotype are predicted over time for a specified diet from
 estimated mature size. Estimates of carcass fatness over time
 as a function of the energy content of the diet and estimates
 of dressing percentage over time are used for each genotype. A
 base model is described that incorporates biological
 parameters estimated for 11 breeds from a major breed
 comparison experiment and uses prices of inputs and outputs
 for Ontario feedlots. Sensitivity of the model to these
 biological and economic assumptions is shown. When breeds are
 compared at constant days fed, weight, or fat depth slaughter
 points, rankings are inconsistent, relative to those when each
 breed is slaughtered at its optimal economic point. The model
 can be used to establish appropriate slaughter end points for
 comparing beef cattle breeds and crosses and to evaluate
 breeding objectives for feedlot traits in genetic improvement
 programs.

 Abstract:  The objective of this study was to determine
 whether the occurrence of dark cutters and selected carcass
 traits differ between pregnant and nonpregnant feedlot
 heifers. Feedlot heifers (n = 8,292) were identified at
 slaughter as being either nonpregnant, pregnant with a
 moderate-sized fetus (midgestation), or pregnant with a large
 fetus (late gestation). This was based on visual appraisal of
 a gravid uterus at the evisceration table. After chilling (24
 to 72 h), carcass data were collected. Cattle originated from
 23 different commercial feedyards located within a 350-km
 radius of a commercial slaughter facility located in southwest
 Kansas. Across slaughter lots, the incidence of pregnancy
 varied from 0 to 25% with an overall mean of 4.74%. Carcass
 traits of heifers with moderate or large fetuses did not
 differ (P &gt; .15). Compared with carcasses from nonpregnant
 heifers, carcasses from pregnant heifers were 4.5 kg lighter
 (P &lt; .01), had .11 cm more fat thickness (P &lt; .01), and
 exceeded the number of carcasses that graded Choice or Prime
 by 6% (P &lt; .01). Carcasses from pregnant heifers had higher
 maturity scores (P &lt; .01) and there was no incidence of dark
 cutters (P &lt; .01) compared with a 1.7% incidence of dark
 cutters in carcasses from nonpregnant heifers. Any economical
 advantage in the pregnant heifers due to their higher
 percentage of Choice carcasses and lower incidence of dark
 cutters may be offset by their increased carcass fat thickness
 and lower dressing percentage.

 Abstract:  A diverse array of secondary metabolites deters
 feeding by mammals on woody plants. However, not all secondary
 metabolites are equally deterrent and the potencies of these
 substances as antifeedants is related to their structures.
 Although the physiological reason underlying deterrence by
 secondary metabolites is not well understood, the available
 evidence indicates that toxicity is more important than
 digestion inhibition. Resource limitation influences the
 production of secondary metabolites by woody plants. Species
 that are adapted to unproductive habitats are more chemically
 defended than species that are adapted to productive habitats.
 Resource limitation also affects the phenotypic expression of
 chemical defense with nutrient stress favoring increased
 production of carbon-based secondary metabolites and reduced
 production of nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites. Light
 stress has the opposite effects on the production of these
 substances. Herbivory by mammals also affects the chemical
 defenses of woody plants. In some cases browsing results in
 increased defense and in others decreased defense. Three
 circumstances under which browsing by mammals can change the
 chemical defenses of woody plants are discussed.

 Abstract:  Starting with an individual firm and its quadratic
 production function, this paper derives all related functions:
 marginal and average cost, supply, profit, and input demand.
 Since derivatives in other functions correspond to parameters
 of the quadratic, the results generalize. Explicit aggregation
 from firm to market shows that properly specified aggregate
 functions depend on firm numbers. To illustrate the results,
 marginal and average cost functions for several dairy farms
 are drawn to scale, noting that large farms get more output
 per cow than small farms. Juxtaposing the cost curves with
 trends in dairy farms by size shows the link between firm-
 level profit and structural change.

 Abstract:  One hundred twenty crossbred beef steers averaging
 377 kg were used in a 2 X 4 factorial experiment to determine
 the dose-response effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin
 (rbST) implants on growth performance and carcass
 characteristics. The implant dosages were 0 (sham), 40, 80, or
 160 mg/wk administered s.c. in the tailhead region on a weekly
 basis throughout the experiment. The steers were fed a high-
 concentrate diet, which contained either a degradable (DP;
 soybean meal) or an escape (EP; corn gluten and blood meal)
 protein source. No dietary protein effect or dietary protein X
 rbST level interactions were detected. Recombinant bST
 decreased both DMI (P &lt; .10) and feed/gain (P &lt; .05) in a
 linear dose-dependent manner. Dosage of rbST did not
 significantly affect (P &gt; .10) ADG or final weight of the
 steers. Recombinant bST decreased backfat depth (P &lt; .10),
 marbling score (P &lt; .05), and quality grade (P &lt; .10) and
 increased yield grade (P &lt; .10) in a linear dose-dependent
 manner. Soft tissue composition of the 9-10-11th rib section
 was altered (P &lt; .01) by rbST administration in a linear dose-
 dependent manner. The percentage of protein in the rib section
 was increased by 9.4% and fat was decreased by 11.8% at the
 160 mg/wk rbST level compared with the sham-implanted steers.
 Recombinant bST did not affect (P &gt; .10) dressing percentage,
 hot carcass weight, kidney, pelvic, and heart fat, or
 longissimus muscle area. Serum insulin-like growth factor I
 (IGF-I) concentrations in the steers exhibited a linear
 response to dosage of rbST (P &lt; .01). These data indicate that
 rbST is an efficacious method of improving feedlot performance
 and partitioning nutrient deposition in feedlot steers.

 Economic evaluation of heterosis and culling policies for

 Abstract:  Experimental lifetime performance data obtained
 from 156 straightbred Hereford, Angus, and Shorthorn and 172
 first-cross heifers were used to estimate heterosis for
 economic efficiency in a 100-cow herd at age equilibrium under
 three culling policies and at terminal ages from 6 to 12 yr.
 All nonpregnant heifers and cows &gt; 9 yr of age were culled.
 The culling policy for removal of nonpregnant cows from second
 parity through 9 yr of age were 1) no culling, 2) after two
 consecutive years (actual), and 3) all (imposed). Efficiency
 was calculated as input cost per unit of output value. A 10-yr
 average was used for costs of replacement heifers, cow units,
 and the ratio of calf-cull cow prices (PR), plus higher and
 lower PR. Input included costs for both cow units and
 purchased replacements. Output value included both weaned
 calves and cull cows. Optimum terminal age was mainly a
 function of PR: 9 yr for average and high PR, but 6 through 9
 yr when PR was low, regardless of culling policy or breed
 groups. Efficiency differences among culling policies were
 small for high or average PR, but more culling for infertility
 was beneficial when PR was low. Estimated reductions in unit
 costs of output value under any culling policy or terminal age
 were approximately 6% from crossbred cows plus another 6% from
 crossbred calves, or a total of 12% from specific three-breed
 crossing of these British breeds. Cost reductions would be
 somewhat less for rotation crossbreeding but greater for
 mating smaller crossbred cows with sires of superior growth-
 carcass breeds.

 Abstract:  The effects of an implant of 140 mg of trenbolone
 acetate and 28 mg of estradiol (TBA + E2) on performance and
 carcass composition were evaluated with 72 individually fed
 steers. Holstein (n = 24), Angus (n = 24), and Angus X
 Simmental (n = 24) steer calves were allocated by breed and
 implant treatment to either an individual feeding pen (n = 36)
 or an electronic feeding door in a group pen (three pens with
 12 animals per pen). Intake and refusal of the 85% concentrate
 diet were recorded daily. Animals were slaughtered when
 ultrasonic attenuation values of the longissimus muscle at the
 12th rib reached .55, which is correlated with low Choice
 marbling. At slaughter, complete carcass measurements were
 taken and the right side of each carcass was separated into
 boneless wholesale cuts. Implanting with TBA + E2 improved (P
 &lt; .01) daily gain and feed efficiency. Daily gain was
 increased 17, 26, and 21% in Holstein, Angus, and crossbred
 steers, respectively. The implant increased overall daily
 protein and fat accretion 23%. Carcass conformation and
 dressing percentage were not affected (P &gt; .05) by TBA + E2
 treatment. Implantation with TBA + E2 had little effect on
 yield of wholesale boneless cuts when expressed as a
 percentage of carcass weight but increased absolute weight as
 a small degree of marbling by 6 to 40 kg.

 Abstract:  All significant properties of the herbivore trophic
 level, including biomass, consumption and productivity, are
 significantly correlated with primary productivity across a
 broad range of terrestrial ecosystems. Here we show that
 livestock biomass in South American agricultural ecosystems
 across a 25-fold gradient of primary productivity exhibited a
 relationship with a slope essentially identical to unmanaged
 ecosystems, but with a substantially greater y-intercept.
 Therefore the biomass of herbivores supported per unit of
 primary productivity is about an order of magnitude greater in
 agricultural than in natural ecosystems, for a given level of
 primary production. We also present evidence of an increase in
 livestock body size with primary productivity, a pattern
 previously characterized in natural ecosystems. To our
 knowledge this is the first quantitative documentation at a
 regional scale of the impact of animal husbandry practices,
 such as herding, stock selection and veterinary care, on the
 biomass and size-structure of livestock herds compared with
 native herbivores.

 Abstract:  During the summer and fall of 1982, a study was
 established on the Nez Perce National Forest in central Idaho
 to assess the effects of cattle grazing on the performance of
 a new ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) plantation. Three
 study sites were located in a Douglas-fir/ninebark
 (Pseudotsuga menziesii/Physocarpus malvaceus) habitat type.
 Results after six years showed that livestock use can
 influence tree seedling establishment. Mortality and damage to
 tree seedlings from cattle resulted primarily from trampling
 rather than from browsing. Five and one-half percent of the
 seedlings were damaged by cattle, of which 3.6% died. Browsing
 by deer and elk caused the most growth loss. Overall damage
 was greatest from non-animal causes. Seedling quality at the
 time of planting, handling of the seedling, and droughty
 conditions during the first two years of the study contributed
 to this type of damage. Overall performance of the tree
 seedlings were relatively poor. Total mortality to tree
 seedlings resulting from all sources of damage was 43.6% for
 the grazed treatment and 25.3% for the non-grazed treatment.

 Abstract:  Two trials (winter and summer) were conducted to
 determine effects of fasting and transportation and
 adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTED) administration on the
 amount and source of weight lost by feeder steers. Sixteen
 steers, in each of two experiments, were adapted to metabolism
 status for 10 d, were fed medium-quality hay at 2.1% of BW for
 3 d, and then were subjected to either fasting alone or
 fasting plus transit for 48 h. In Exp. 1 steers were randomly
 assigned to treatments. In Exp. 2 steers were blocked by age
 (OLD or YOUNG) and assigned to treatments. Fecal and urinary
 excretions accounted for 65 and 38% of the total weight lost
 in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. Fasting plus transit did not
 consistently increase the amount of weight lost compared with
 fasting alone but increased (P &lt; .01) plasma glucose
 concentrations. Injection of ACTH before either fasting alone
 or fasting plus transit increased (P &lt; .05) the amount of
 weight lost as feces. Steers in the OLD group lost more weight
 during transit and fasting but regained the lost weight faster
 (P &lt; .01) during the recovery period than did steers in the
 YOUNG group. Injecting YOUNG steers with ACTH before fasting
 alone or fasting plus transit increased plasma fibrinogen (P &lt;
 .10) and serum glucose (P &lt; .05) concentrations more than ACTH
 injections in OLD steers. Although fasting and transit elicit
 mobilization of body nutrients and resulted in a loss of BW,
 these effects were quickly reversed during the post-stress
 period.

 Abstract:  Studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of
 delayed implanting or the use of a low-dose implant followed
 by a higher-dose implant in feedlot cattle. In the first
 study, 150 steers were allotted to 15 pens (three
 pens/treatment) and assigned to a nonimplant treatment
 (control), a single zeranol (36 mg) implant (R), or a double
 zeranol implant (DR) administered at the start of a 140-d
 finishing period, or a single zeranol implant administered at
 the start of an 80-d growing period, followed by a single (RR)
 or double (RDR) zeranol implant administered at the start of
 the finishing period. Steers managed under the DR, RR, and RDR
 implant schemes had greater (P &lt; .10) finishing period gains
 and intakes than the control steer group. However, only DR and
 RDR steer groups had improved (P &lt; .10) finishing period feed
 conversions compared with control steers. In combined growing
 and finishing periods, the RDR steer group displayed the
 lowest (P = .12) feed:gain ratio. In a second trial, conducted
 concurrently to the zeranol trial, steers that did not receive
 an initial implant containing 20 mg of estradiol benzoate plus
 200 mg of progesterone (S) but were subsequently implanted
 twice, once at the start of the finishing period and again 80
 d later, had a lower (P &lt; .11) finishing period feed:gain
 ratio (6.08 vs 6.51) than steers implanted all three times. In
 a third trial, implanting steers with one-half S vs S, at the
 start of a 92-d growing period, resulted in improved (P &lt; .05)
 gain (1.63 vs 1.54 kg/d) and feed: gain ratio (5.86 vs 6.27)
 in the subsequent finishing period, in which both groups
 received S, but not over the entire feeding period. Compared
 with using S alone, as a finishing phase implant, no
 differences were found in performance or carcass quality from
 using S in combination with trenbolone acetate. Delayed
 implanting or using a low-dose implant during an initial
 feeding period provides performance enhancement in subsequent
 feeding periods; however, benefits are not great enough to
 consistently show significant performance benefits over the
 entire growing and finishing period.

 Abstract:  The productivity and well-being of animals can be
 substantially affected by stress. This is particularly true in
 the case of beef calves that are subjected to a multitude of
 stressors over a short period during the first year of life.
 Perhaps the most often studied stress-responsive variable has
 been blood corticosteroid concentrations. Factors such as age,
 gender, genetics, and degree of prior experience, can
 influence how an animal perceives and responds to a given
 stressor. Few studies have tried to control these variables,
 and accordingly, many conflicting results have been published
 regarding the impact of various stressors on cortisol
 response. We measured baseline plasma cortisol concentration
 over a 44-day study in Bos indicus and Bos taurus calves.
 Plasma cortisol values in Bos indicus calves were higher
 (32.60 +/- 0.66 ng/ml) than values in calves of Bos taurus
 (25.81 +/- 0.76) breeding. A precipitous decrease in cortisol
 concentration was observed 7 days after transport stress in
 all calves. Baseline cortisol concentration did not provide
 any indication of the intensity of the various stressors.
 However, significant differences were readily observed after
 ACTH administration. On the basis of cortisol secretion,
 stresses of transport and weaning were similar and were the
 most stressful to calves, regardless of genotype.

 Abstract:  Two postweaning feeding trials were conducted on
 112 bull calves from a beef synthetic breed group to examine
 the effects of postweaning level of dietary energy and change
 in the level of energy on sex drive and semen quality of young
 bulls in 1988 and 1989. Within each year, the test period was
 168 d, which was divided in two periods of 77 d and separated
 by a 14-d adjustment period. Within each year the bulls were
 randomly assigned to eight pens. The pen population was
 balanced with respect to age and weight of bulls. Bulls in
 four of the pens were fed a high concentrate diet while those
 in the remaining four pens were fed a low concentrate diet
 consisting of one half of the high diet plus hay ad libitum in
 the first period. After the adjustment period, the diets of
 four pens of bulls were reversed from high to low or from low
 to high resulting in high-high, high-low, low-high and low-low
 dietary treatments. The year was a significant (P&lt;0.05) source
 of variation for all the components of libido score except for
 number of services achieved. The effect of energy on
 components of libido and libido score was not significant
 (P&gt;0.05). Bulls on high-high had significantly larger scrotal
 circumference but exhibited poorer semen characteristics than
 their contemporaries on high-low, low-high and low-low diets.
 Even though feeding of high energy diet throughout the feedlot
 test period showed a positive effect on scrotal circumference,
 its effect on semen quality was negative. It was found that
 feeding a low energy diet in either half of the feedlot test
 period may prevent the detrimental effects of prolonged high
 energy feeding on semen characteristics of young beef bulls.

 Abstract:  The pre-slaughter handling, behaviour and blood
 composition of beef cattle at slaughter was studied in a
 commercial slaughterhouse. The main problems identified were
 the routine use of driving instruments and delays caused by
 stoppages in the slaughter line. The plasma concentration of
 cortisol at the time of slaughter was positively correlated
 with the time spent standing still and with the time spent in
 the pre-stun pen. The plasma activity of creatine kinase was
 positively correlated with the time spent in the race, but no
 correlations between creatine kinase and physical activity in
 the race were found. The plasma concentration of glucose was
 positively correlated with the time spent trotting and the
 number of times that struggling occurred. The proportions of
 cattle struggling, vocalizing and defaecating were greatest
 when they were confined in the race and pre-stun pen. Cattle
 kept overnight in the lairage had a greater concentration of
 free fatty acids at the time of slaughter than those
 slaughtered on the day of arrival. There were no other
 significant differences in either the blood compositon or the
 handling and behaviour of cattle kept overnight in the
 lairage, compared with those slaughtered on the day of
 arrival. Some of the handling problems observed were caused by
 incorrect design of the handling facilities. There should be
 some means of removing cattle from a race if delays are
 encountered and some means of handling the cattle in the race
 other than by using an electrical goad. The optimal dimensions
 of races and passageways to prevent crowding and turning
 around should be assessed at the design stage. Non-slip floors
 are essential.

 Abstract:  Four experiments were conducted to evaluate the
 effect of a soybean hull, soy lecithin, and soapstock mixture
 on ruminal fiber and protein digestion, growth efficiency of
 beef calves, and lactational performance of dairy cattle. An
 initial mixing experiment determined that a 4:1 ratio (DM
 basis) of soy lecithin:soapstock could be added to soybean
 hulls at 15% (wt/wt, DM basis); this mixture had acceptable
 mixing and handling characteristics. Dietary addition of a
 mixture of 85% soybean hulls, 12% soy lecithin, and 3%
 soapstock (DM basis; SLS) to provide 0, 3, 5, or 7%
 supplemental fat resulted in a linear (P &lt; .01) decrease in in
 situ rate of ruminal NDF digestion with no effect on rate of
 CP digestion. Daily gain, DMI, and feed efficiency (kilograms
 of gain/kilogram of DMI) of growing beef calves were not
 affected (P &gt; .10) as graded levels of SLS replaced corn
 grain. However, as graded levels of SLS replaced soybean
 hulls, daily gain and feed efficiency increased linearly (P &lt;
 .01). Based on the results of these trials, Holstein dairy
 cattle were fed four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets
 that contained either high levels of nonfiber carbohydrates
 (43%) and no added fat, 1% ruminally inert fat, a 6% level of
 SLS, or a 12% SLS level (all on DM basis). Efficiency of 4%
 fat-corrected milk production (kilograms of milk/kilogram of
 DMI) was greatest for cows fed SLS at 6% of dietary DM. The
 SLS mixture was an excellent source of fiber and vegetable
 fat, comparable in feeding value to corn grain, for inclusion
 in the diets of beef calves and dairy cows.

 Abstract:  Changes in performance traits in beef cattle over
 the last 30 yr necessitate the reevaluation of central testing
 procedures to ensure that they are cost effective and
 appropriate for current test objectives. The objective of this
 study was to evaluate the potential for reducing the length of
 evaluation from 140 d to either 112 or 84 d. Data evaluated
 were postweaning feedlot performance test records (collected
 from 1977 to 1986) on 1,830 individually fed bulls. Bulls
 representing 13 breeds (n &gt; 25 per breed) were evaluated in
 the University of Arkansas Cooperative Bull Tests at
 Fayetteville, Hope, and Monticello, Arkansas. Models were fit
 for ADG, daily feed intake (FI) and feed conversion (FCONV)
 from d 1 to d 140 (ADG1-140, FI1-140 and FCONV1-140,
 respectively) and from d 1 to d 112 (ADG1-112, FI1-112 and
 FCONV1-112, respectively). Models fit for ADG1-140, FI1-140,
 and FCONV1-140 using information up to d 112 had R2 of .90,
 .99, .88, and .94, respectively, and using information up to d
 84 had R2 of .82, .94, and .80, respectively. Spearman rank
 correlation coefficients (all P &lt; .0001) were .93 for ADG1-140
 and ADG1-112, .93 for ADG1-112 and ADG1-84, .99 for FI1-140
 and FI1-112, .91 for FCONV1-140 and FCONV1-112, and .90 for
 FCONV1-112 and FCONV1-84. These coefficients indicate that
 bulls ranked similarly for performance traits at 84, 112, and
 140 d. If the primary objective of central station testing is
 to evaluate ADG during the linear phase of growth, and if
 testing procedures are those currently recommended by the Beef
 Improvement Federation, then feeding bulls beyond 112 d has no
 advantage because the information upon which selection
 decisions are made is similar at both 112 and 140 d.

 Abstract:  Successful reproduction is dependent on a host of
 macro- and micronutrients and ceases well before an animal
 expires from deficiency of a particular nutrient. This review
 focuses on the functional roles phosphorus, vitamin A and
 beta-carotene, protein, and energy play in reproductive
 processes. Although it is not known whether deficiencies of
 these nutrients limit reproduction through common or discrete
 mechanisms, appropriate quantities of these nutrients are
 required for optimal reproduction. Mechanisms through which
 nutritional status is perceived by the hypothalamic-pituitary-
 gonadal axis remain unclear but seem to impinge on
 hypothalamic regions that selectively regulate production and
 release of pituitary trophic hormones. Body condition, or
 degree of fatness, seems to be the most reliable indicator of
 well-being of an animal, and when coupled with changes in BW,
 provides a useful method to assess reproductive potential.

 Abstract:  A 5-yr study was conducted involving the placement
 of yearling steers on feed at 2-mo intervals under three
 different housing systems. A total of 3,571 steers (180 pens)
 initially average 318 kg was used. Evaluations were made for
 DM intake ADG, feed efficiency (FE), carcass quality (QG), and
 yield grades (YG). Cattle were assigned to either an open lot
 with overhead shelter (S), an open lot without overhead
 shelter (NS), or an open-front confinement building (C). Each
 treatment consisted of two lots of 20 steers each per interval
 per trial. Corn grain provided 85% of the energy; the
 remainder was supplied by corn silage arid protein supplement.
 Cattle were fed 140 to 180 d to achieve an average slaughter
 weight of 500 kg. The main effects of year (Y), month (M), and
 housing (H) affected DM intake, ADG, FE, and final live weight
 (P &lt;.01). The interactions for Y X M, M X H and Y X M X H
 affected ADG (P &lt;.05). Month and H affected hot carcass weight
 (P &lt; .01). Year affected YG, and year and month affected QG (P
 &lt; .01). Month effects on DM intake and ADG indicated that
 cattle started in May had the highest intake and ADG (P &lt; .05)
 and that cattle started in November had the lowest (P &lt; .05)
 DMI and ADG. Month effects on FE indicated that cattle were
 most efficient when placed on feed during March, May, and July
 (5.82, 5.72, and 5.66 kg DM/kg gain; P &lt; .05). Housing effects
 indicated that S cattle had the highest DM intake, ADG, and FE
 (7.79, 1.29, and 6.15 kg; P &lt; .05) and that C had the lowest
 DM intake and ADG (6.97 and 1.09 kg; P &lt; .05). Body
 composition, as determined by YG and QG, was relatively
 unaffected by the season or housing. These results indicate
 that starting time on feed and housing system significantly
 influenced cattle feedlot performance without influencing body
 composition.

 Abstract:  The effects of dietary energy and recombinant
 bovine somatotropin (bST) on pattern of LH release, follicular
 development, and onset of puberty were studied in 40 Angus
 heifers. At 7 mo of age, heifers were assigned to a 2 X 2
 factorial experiment; the main effects were dietary energy
 (high [HDE]: 14.15 Mcal of ME/d or moderate [MDE]: 10.84 Mcal
 of ME/d) and somatotropin (bST; 350 mg every 2 wk or vehicle).
 Beginning at 9 mo of age, heifers were observed twice daily
 for estrous activity. From 10.5 to 12 mo of age, five heifers
 from each treatment group were selected for weekly ultrasound
 examination of ovarian structures and biweekly sequential
 blood sampling to determine concentrations of LH. Somatotropin
 treatment altered intermediary metabolism in a manner
 consistent with enhanced accretion of lean tissue and
 decreased deposition of fat. The HDE heifers were younger (P &lt;
 .001) at puberty than the MDE heifers, but BW at puberty was
 not different among treatment groups. Age and body weight at
 puberty were not affected by bST. Frequency of LH pulses
 increased within the 10.5 to 12 mo of age sampling window in
 HDE-treated heifers but not in MDE heifers (dietary energy X
 month of age; P &lt; .02). Secretion of LH was unaffected by bST.
 Ovaries of bST-treated heifers tended (P &lt; .09) to have fewer
 follicles &gt; 5 mm in diameter than those of vehicle-treated
 heifers. We conclude that chronic treatment with bST did not
 alter age at puberty or pattern of LH release in heifers and
 that even modest differences in energy intake influence the
 timing of the prepubertal increase in pulsatile LH release.

 Abstract:  In 2 studies, plasma, erythrocyte, and neutrophil
 alpha-tocopherol concentrations were monitored in beef cattle
 after shipping, handling, and sample collection. On the basis
 of alpha-tocopherol results, an additional 2 studies were
 designed to measure the effects of administration of
 adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and epinephrine on the
 alpha-tocopherol concentration in the aforementioned blood
 constituents and on creatine kinase (CK) activity in Holstein
 calves. In the first of these studies, 15 beef cattle that had
 recently arrived at the feedlot consumed feed supplemented
 daily with 1,000 IU of dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate. Values for
 initial blood samples indicated that CK activity was high.
 Although plasma alpha-tocopherol concentration indicated that
 vitamin supplementation was adequate, RBC and neutrophil
 alpha-tocopherol values were generallynondetectable. After 4
 weeks of supplementation, plasma alpha-tocopherol
 concentration increased (P &lt; 0.05), and neutrophil and RBC
 alpha-tocopherol values became measurable in most of the
 cattle. In the second study, 6 beef heifers had decreased (P &lt;
 0.05) plasma, RBC, and neutrophil alpha-tocopherol values
 after multiple periods of handling and blood sample
 collection. In the third and fourth studies, 10 tamed Holstein
 heifer calves, 5 of which were administered ACTH and
 epinephrine to simulate stress effects on blood alpha-
 tocopherol concentrations and CK activity. In study 3, the
 vitamin E-adequate heifers had increased blood CK (P &lt; 0.001)
 activity and cortisol (P &lt; 0.01) concentration, and decreased
 (P &lt; 0.05) neutrophil alpha-tocopherol concentration after
 hormone injections. In study 4, when vitamin E-deficient
 calves received the aforementioned hormones, CK activity
 increased (P &lt; 0.05) and RBC alpha-tocopherol concentration
 decreased (P &lt; 0.05), whereas plasma and neutrophil values did
 not change. These results indicate that shipping and handling,
 or the stress paradigm of ACTH and epinephrine injections, may
 reduce the alpha-tocopherol content of plasma, RBC, and
 neutrophils while increasing plasma CK activity, which
 indicates membrane destruction.

 Abstract:  Cattle respond to the feeding of stable flies,
 Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), by bunching to protect their front
 legs. This bunching can increase heat stress which indirectly
 accounts for much of the reduction in cattle weight gains. We
 used fly-screened, self-contained feedlot pens which allowed
 regulation of fly populations feeding on cattle. The indirect
 fly effects (bunching and heat stress) accounted for 71.5% of
 the reduced weight gain. The direct effect of the biting flies
 and energy loss involved in fighting flies accounted for 28.5%
 of the reduced weight gain.

 Abstract:  Seventy-two Holstein steers averaging 182 kg were
 assigned randomly to one of six treatment groups: 1)
 nonimplanted controls (C); 2) implanted with 36 mg of zeranol
 (Z); 3) implanted with 20 mg of estradiol benzoate and 200 mg
 of progesterone (EP); 4) implanted with 140 mg of trenbolone
 acetate (TBA); 5) implanted with 140 mg of trenbolone acetate
 plus 20 mg of estradiol benzoate and 200 mg of progesterone
 (TBA + EP); and 6) implanted with 140 mg of trenbolone acetate
 plus 36 mg of zeranol (TBA + Z). Each treatment group
 consisted of three replications of four animals per pen, which
 were implanted on d 0, 56, 112, and 168. Masculinity and
 muscling scores were assigned at 24 h preslaughter. Hide
 removal difficulty was scored by a plant supervisor. Quality
 and yield grade data were obtained at 24 h postmortem.
 Longissimus muscle (LM) steaks were removed and cooked for
 Warner-Bratzler shear (WBS) determinations and sensory panel
 (SP) evaluations. Over the entire feeding period (249 d), TBA
 + EP steers had higher (P &lt; .05) ADG than TBA + Z, TBA, and C
 steers. All treatments had higher (P &lt; .05) ADG than C, with
 the exception of TBA. The only feed efficiency differences
 were those following the 168-d implant time, when TBA steers
 were more (P &lt; .05) efficient than TBA + Z or C steers. The
 TBA + EP and TBA + Z steers were more (P &lt; .05) masculine and
 their hides were more (P &lt; .05) difficult to remove than those
 of EP and C steers. Carcass weights of TBA + EP steers were
 heavier (P &lt; .05) than those of TBA or C steers. The TBA + EP
 steers had larger (P &lt; .05) LM areas than Z, TBA, and C
 steers. Also, TBA + EP steers tended (P = .07) to have lower
 numerical yield grades than EP, Z, or C steers. Even though
 mean marbling scores and quality grades were similar (P &gt; .05)
 among treatment groups, only 50% of TBA + EP carcasses graded
 low Choice or higher, compared with 100, 75, 82, 90, and 83%
 for C, TBA, Z, EP, and TBA + Z carcasses, respectively. The

 Abstract:  A static model of developed water use for U.S.
 cattle production was constructed on a spreadsheet. Water use
 included that consumed directly by various classes of animals,
 water applied for irrigation of crops that are consumed by the
 cattle, water applied to irrigated pasture, and water used to
 process animals at marketing. Government statistics were
 consulted for numbers of cattle and crop production. The most
 recent statistics available for numbers of cattle and crops in
 individual states were used. On January 1, 1992, a total of
 33.8 million beef cows and 5.7 million replacement heifers
 were in U.S. breeding herds, 12 million animals were on feed,
 and approximately 28 million animals were fed annually. Thus,
 the U.S. beef cattle herd produced 6.9 billion kg of boneless
 beef. Beef cattle directly consumed 760 billion L of water per
 year. Feedlot cattle were fed various grain and roughage
 sources corresponding to the regions in which they were fed.
 Feeds produced in a state were preferentially used by cattle
 in that state with that state's efficiency; any additional
 feedstuffs required used water at the national efficiency.
 Irrigation of crop feedstuffs for beef cattle required 12,991
 billion L of water. Irrigated pasture for beef cattle
 production required an additional 11,243 billion L of water.
 Carcass processing required 79 billion L of water. The model
 estimates 3,682 L of developed water per kilogram of boneless
 meat for beef cattle production in the United States. The
 model was most sensitive to the dressing percentage and
 percentage of boneless yield in carcasses of feedlot cattle
 (62 and 66.7, respectively). A 10% change in either of these
 parameters resulted in a corresponding 8.6% change in the
 water required for beef production. A 10% increase in the
 number of animals on feed resulted in a decrease in the amount
 of water per kilogram of boneless beef by 5.2%. Changes in
 irrigated pasture management would also be an effective means
 of decreasing the w

 Abstract:  Angus (A), Charolais (C), Hereford (H), Limousin
 (L), and Simmental (S) breeds were included in deterministic
 computer models simulating integrated cow-calf-feedlot
 production systems. Three mating systems were used:
 purebreeding and two-and three-breed rotational crossbreeding.
 Breed information was taken from the literature. Herd sizes
 were unrestricted; however, 100 heifers were saved as
 replacements. Cows were removed for reproductive failure, age
 (&gt; 10.5 yr), or death. Calves produced in the cow-calf segment
 were fed in a custom feedlot to four slaughter end points: 440
 d, 457 d, 288-kg carcass weight, and low Choice. All animals
 were fed to requirements. Cull cows were slaughtered after
 weaning. Biological and economic efficiencies improved with
 crossbreeding; however, rankings of breed combinations
 depended on how efficiencies were measured (weight, lean, or
 value basis). Among purebreds, reproductive performance had a
 large influence on breed rankings at age and weight end
 points, whereas feedlot performance was important at the low
 Choice end point. Crossbred combinations involving British (A
 or H) and Continental (C or S) breeds were more efficient than
 other crossbred combinations at all end points. However,
 choosing specific breed combinations for integrated systems
 depends on slaughter end points, market end points (weight vs
 lean), and measures of efficiency (weight, lean, or value
 basis).

 Abstract:  Large-framed Simmental and Charolais steers were
 actively immunized against growth hormone-releasing factor
 (GRF) to evaluate the effect on growth, carcass
 characteristics (especially intramuscular fat deposition), and
 concentrations of somatotropin (ST) and IGF-I.Primary
 immunizations of 1.5 mg of GRF-(1-29)-Gly-Gly-Cys- NH2
 conjugated to 1.5 mg of human serum albumin (GRFi, n = 12) or
 1.5 mg of human serum albumin (HSAi, n = 12) were given at
 approximately 10 mo of age. Booster immunizations of .5 mg of
 the appropriate antigen were given at d 49 and 125. Weights of
 steers administered GRFi were less (P &lt; .05) than those given
 HSAi at 126 d (34.6 kg) or at 262 d (48.2 kg) after treatment.
 Carcass weights were 28.2 kg less (P &lt; .01) for GRFi than for
 HSAi steers. Dry matter intake was not affected by
 immunization treatment, whereas feed efficiency was reduced in
 GRFi steers. Marbling scores were higher (P &lt; .05) for HSAi
 than for GRFi steers but similar percentages (83.3) of both
 treatments graded Low Choice or higher. Rib sections of GRFi
 steers contained more fat (31.2 vs 25.0%) and less lean (63.3
 vs 68.4%) than those of HSAi steers (P &lt; .05). A breed X
 treatment interaction was observed for percentage of fat
 within the trimmed longissimus muscle (P &lt; .05); percentage of
 fat was similar for Charolais and Simmental steers when
 immunized against HSAi but was higher for Simmental than for
 Charolais when immunized against GRFi. Reduced serum ST, IGF-
 I, insulin, and plasma glucose concentrations and higher urea
 nitrogen values were observed in GRFi compared with HSAi
 steers.

 Abstract:  In response to stressors, the central nervous
 system of livestock (and other mammalian species) evokes
 physiological responses that ultimately result in activation
 of the hypothalamopituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and the
 sympatho-adrenal axis. The responses of these major systems
 are presumed to have adaptive and homeostatic value during
 periods of stress. The major hormone regulating the synthesis
 and secretion of adrenal glucocorticoids is ACTH. In sheep,
 cattle, and pigs, both corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
 and vasopressin (VP) participate in the regulation of
 secretion of ACTH, and the two peptides seem to interact to
 enhance that secretion. In cattle and pigs, CRH is the more
 potent peptide, whereas VP is the more potent in sheep. In
 addition to its better-known role in regulating pituitary
 function, CRH also may participate as a neurotransmitter
 acting centrally to enhance sympathetic activation of the
 adrenal medulla. Many experimental models of stress have been
 evaluated that reliably activate the HPA axis and the
 sympatho-adrenal medullary axis, and some of these model
 systems also reduce functions of cells of the immune system.
 Recent data support an important role of stressor-activation
 of the sympathetics rather than increased glucocorticoids per
 se in modulating some measures of immune function in response
 to stress. Thus, current dogma of glucocorticoids as the
 primary mediator of stressor-associated alteration in immune
 function of domestic livestock may require reevaluation.

 Abstract:  Challenges and near-term opportunities for growth
 research are examined in light of the needs and concerns for
 those who will ultimately accept, utilize and pay for new
 technology for growth promotion. The challenge from the
 livestock producer is for new ways to improve feed
 utilization. That from the consumer is to reduce fat and
 cholesterol content of meat without substantially changing
 taste, texture or price. Challenges arising from various
 segments of society include the need to ensure product safety
 and animal welfare, particularly with respect to recombinant
 DNA technology. The animal science community is challenged to
 contribute to development of regulatory policy regarding
 application of new technology to animal growth. Additionally,
 government decisions can challenge the long-term research
 planning process. The use of beta-adrenergic agonists, peptide
 hormones and growth factors and development of ways to manage
 gonadally intact males are suggested as near-term
 opportunities for growth research.

 Abstract:  Lorry drivers are exposed to a wide range of
 mechanical vibrations and random motions. The seat and
 sometimes the cab suspensions are designed to reduce vibration
 exposure. Nevertheless drivers are often subjected to
 considerable discomfort occurring within minutes of starting a
 journey. The frequencies and axes of vibration which occur at
 a driver's seat are often close to those of maximum discomfort
 for the human. On a livestock transporter, the interfaces
 between the animals and the vehicle are not designed to reduce
 vibration and it is possible that animals are subjected to a
 higher vibration magnitude than the driver. However, nothing
 is known of the discomfort or welfare levels experienced by
 livestock (e.g. cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry) during
 transport as the result of vibration and motion. This paper
 draws analogues with subjective evaluations of human comfort
 and poses a number of questions which must be addressed by
 research in order to quantify vibration dose, animal welfare
 response relationships. The primary requirement is to
 determine to what extent frequency dependent response
 weightings for the most important axes of vibration are
 necessary for each animal species and to determine how they
 should be defined. This would enable a comparison to be made
 between the experiences of humans and animals.

 Abstract:  The microbial flora transferred to carcasses during
 slaughter is a reflection of the care taken on the slaughter
 floor and of the types and numbers of microorganisms acquired
 by the animal on the farm or during the period of
 transportation to the slaughter house. These microorganisms
 may include those able to cause illness in the consumer, or
 microorganisms responsible for spoilage of the product.
 Considerable progress has been made in reducing contamination
 at slaughter and thereby extending the shelf-life of meat. In
 contrast, international statistics still clearly show that
 meat and meat products are responsible for a major proportion
 of all foodborne infections. This latter aspect is not
 determined by the overall number of microorganisms present but
 by the bacterial composition of the. animal's gut flora at
 slaughter. Preventive quality assurance along the whole
 productions and processing line is therefore the only
 effective means of controlling the microbiological safely and
 quality of meat. This includes, hazard analysis techniques to
 identify critical control points and procedures for monitoring
 the microbiological status of both animals and carcasses since
 most of the critical points cannot be totally controlled. At
 early stages in the production line, colonisation of meat
 animals with pathogens should be prevented. Subsequently, good
 slaughter practices will ensure carcasses of good overall
 microbiological quality. This paper deals with microbiological
 monitoring systems that can be used at different stages of
 production and processing to control the microbiological
 quality of poultry and pig meat.

 Abstract:  The effect of implanting trenbolone acetate and
 estradiol 17 beta on feedlot performance and carcass
 characteristics of finishing steers was studied. A lactose- or
 cholesterol-based pellet containing 140 mg trenbolone acetate
 and 28 mg estradiol was implanted in yearling steers fed a
 high-roughage diet consisting of corn silage and supplement
 for 140 d. There was a 20% increase (P&lt; 0.05) in rate of gain
 from the use of the implant in either base. A second implant
 with a lactose base given at the mid-point of the feeding
 period improved daily gain by an additional 7.5%. Dry matter
 intake was similar among control cattle and those receiving
 the different implants. Feed efficiency was improved (P &lt;
 0.05) by the lactose-base and the cholesterol-based implants.
 Use of the two lactose-based implants resulted in 23%
 improvements in feed efficiency, compared to the control
 cattle. Hot carcass weights were heavier (P &lt; 0.05) for
 implanted cattle but carcass quality grades were lower (P &lt;
 0.05). Ribeye area was increased (P &lt; 0.05) by the
 cholesterol-base and the two lactose-based pellets. These data
 indicate that combined androgenic-estrogenic anabolic implants
 enhanced feedlot performance and tended to increase edible
 lean and reduce fat in the carcass.

 Abstract:  Changing the body composition of beef has
 implications for the entire beef production system. The
 dynamic nature of an animal's body composition and the
 production system itself make predictions of the implications
 of genetic change in body composition difficult. The cow-calf,
 stocker, and feeder segments of the production system will be
 affected differently. Leaner cattle tend to be slaughtered at
 heavier weights. Heavier weights effectively reduce
 composition differences of slaughter beef to less than the
 genetic differences. The effects of four pricing scenarios on
 slaughter weight and composition were evaluated for two leaner
 genotypes, one with no change in marbling and one with reduced
 marbling. A genetic difference of 1.0 yield grade at the same
 carcass weight resulted in slaughter beef that differed by .4
 to 1.0 yield grade because of increased slaughter weights.
 Separate analyses suggested the stocker segment of beef
 production will be least affected by changes in body
 composition. Genotypes that are best fitted to slaughter
 requirements will have the most flexibility in types of
 stocker systems that can be used. The cow-calf segment of beef
 production has several options to adapt to leaner cattle.
 Management to reduce nutritional stress on leaner cows may be
 required by some producers. Increased selection for
 reproductive traits in cow genotypes may be needed. An
 alternative to selection for reproduction is terminal crossing
 to partially disassociate the slaughter animal's genotype from
 the cow's genotype.

 Abstract:  Livestock grazing endophyte (Acremonium
 coenophialum)-infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea
 Schreb. cv. Kentucky 31) at high ambient temperatures may
 suffer from fescue toxicosis. Adult Angus cows (Bos taurus)
 were fed 0 to 1 kg/d of 70% infected tall fescue seed
 containing about 4.4 g of loline alkaloids in factorial
 combination with thiamin at 0 or 1 g/d. Cows assigned to the
 zero level of tall fescue seed received a supplement of
 equivalent energy and protein. Ingestive behavior was measured
 at 1330 to 1430 EDT during two 4-d periods in two consecutive
 weeks in August on alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) pastures using
 a tethered grazing system. Alfalfa intake per measured grazing
 session of cows given tall fescue seed declined linearly (P &lt;
 .01) as air temperatures during grazing increased above 25
 degrees C, largely because of shorter grazing meals. Thiamin
 increased alfalfa intake per measured grazing session by
 extending grazing time. Alkaloids in ingested endophyte-
 infected tall fescue induce thiamin deficiencies in cattle
 that result in symptoms of tall fescue toxicosis.

 Abstract:  Three roughage sources (bermudagrass hay,
 cottonseed hulls and soybean straw) were evaluated using
 weanling beef heifers for preference, voluntary intake and
 performance during wintering trials. In trial 1, when given
 access to all three roughage sources, heifers preferred (P
 less than .05) bermudagrass hay (7.3 kg/d) to either
 cottonseed hulls (.2 kg/d) or soybean straw (.1 kg/d). In
 trial 2, voluntary intakes of the roughage sources fed
 individually and unsupplemented were higher for bermudagrass
 hay (P less than .05) than cottonseed hulls, which was greater
 (P less than .05) than soybean straw. During the winter
 performance trial (trial 3), heifers consuming the
 bermudagrass hay diet had heavier (P less than .01) final
 weights (255 vs 235 kg) and higher (P less than .01) daily
 gains (.36 vs .15 kg) than heifers fed other roughage-based
 diets. Cottonseed hull diets produced heifers with higher
 daily gains and final weights (P less than .01) compared with
 soybean straw diets. Corn added to the diets of either
 cottonseed hulls or soybean straw increased (P less than .05)
 heifer gains and final weights. Performance of heifers on all
 diets, except soybean straw, was acceptable. Heifers receiving
 soybean straw without supplemental corn grain had weight
 losses during the winter phase, while those fed soybean straw
 plus supplemental corn gained only .11 kg/d. Daily dietary
 costs were similar only when cottonseed hulls could be
 purchased and handled in bulk rather than sacked.

 Abstract:  The establishment and evaluation of an assessment
 system to accredit sonographers for measuring the carcass
 traits of subcutaneous fat depths and longissimus muscle area
 (LMA) on potential breeding animals by real-time ultrasound is
 described. Repeatability of operators, variation between the
 animal's left and right sides, and variations in technique
 were assessed from measurements and repeat measurements of 30
 cattle by up to eight operators at three testing sessions.
 Accuracy of carcass data was determined by repeatability of
 measurements, variability between measurers, between left and
 right sides of the carcass, and variation due to handling and
 dressing procedures. Correlations with carcass data averaged
 .92 for rump fat, .90 for rib fat, and .87 for LMA. Residual
 SD averaged .81 mm, .88 mm, and 5.1 cm2. A very experienced
 sonographer can measure LMA only marginally less accurately
 than it can be measured on the carcass. In Session 3, the SE
 between repeat fat measurements for accredited sonographers
 averaged .43 mm, indicating that fat depths can be measured
 more accurately, but when comparing measurements from
 different operators, adjustments may be required for
 differences in technique, otherwise overall accuracy will be
 about the same, approximately 1 mm. Scanned rump fat
 measurements were consistently approximately 20% higher than
 on the chilled, hanging carcass 24 h after slaughter; after
 applying the standard correction factor of 1.17, LMA
 measurements were similar. Scan and carcass rib fat
 measurements were similar for animals with less than or equal
 to 10 mm of fat cover, above which carcass measurements tended
 to be higher.

 Abstract:  Aflatoxins, a family of closely related,
 biologically active mycotoxins, have been known as a prominent
 cause of animal disease for 30 yr. The toxins occur naturally
 on several key animal feeds, including corn, cottonseed, and
 peanuts. Occurrence of aflatoxin on some field crops tends to
 spike in years when drought and insect damage facilitate
 invasion by the causative organisms, Aspergillus flavus and A.
 parasiticus, which abound in the crop's environment. Acute
 aflatoxicosis causes a distinct overt clinical disease marked
 by hepatitis, icterus, hemorrhage, and death. More chronic
 aflatoxin poisoning produces very protean signs that may not
 be clinically obvious; reduced rate of gain in young animals
 is a sensitive clinical register of chronic aflatoxicosis. The
 immune system is also sensitive to aflatoxin, and suppression
 of cell-mediated immune responsiveness, reduced phagocytosis,
 and depressed complement and interferon production are
 produced. Acquired immunity from vaccination programs may be
 substantially suppressed in some disease models. In such cases
 the signs of disease observed are those of the infectious
 process rather than those of the aflatoxin that predisposed
 the animal to infection. Mixtures of aflatoxin with other
 mycotoxins can result in greatly augmented biological
 responses in terms of rate of gain, lethality, and immune
 reactivity. Because of its great biological activity, its
 widespread potential presence in areas where critical feed
 crops axe grown, and its propensity to spike in problem years,
 aflatoxin promises to be a continuing problem in animal
 production.

 Abstract:  Heifer and steer progeny of 2-yr-old first-cross
 (F1) heifers and 3- to 6-yr-old F1 cows, from Hereford dams
 and five sire breeds, were evaluated for postweaning feedlot
 growth and carcass composition. Breeds of sire of dam were
 Angus (A), Red Poll (RP), Tarentaise (T), Simmental (Sm), and
 Pinzgauer (P). Calves from 2-yr-old heifers were sired by
 Shorthorn, and calves from 3- to 6-yr-old dams were sired by
 Charolais. Breed of sire of dam was significant (P &lt; .05 to P
 &lt; .01) for total gain and final weight for female progeny from
 2-yr-old dams. At all weights, Sm, P, and T ranked above A and
 RP. Progeny of A, P, Sm, and T F1 2-yr-old dams were not
 significantly different but were higher (P &lt; .05) than RP
 heifers in total feedlot gain. Breed of sire of dam was
 significant (P &lt; .05) for carcass weight and longissimus
 muscle area; T ranked highest and RP lowest. Breed was not
 significant for any growth traits of steer progeny of 2-yr-old
 dams. Breed was significant for marbling score; A ranked
 highest and exceeded (P &lt; .01) both RP and Sm steers. Breed
 was significant (P &lt; .05) for most growth traits in the heifer
 progeny of the 3- to 6-yr-old dams bred to Charolais sires.
 Heifer calves of the Sm group were heavier (P &lt; .05) than all
 other groups for most weights and total gain. For total gain,
 P and T were intermediate and A and RP lowest. For heifer
 carcass traits from 3- to 6-yr-old dams, breed was significant
 (P &lt; .05 to P &lt; .01) for carcass weight, longissimus muscle
 area, percentage of cutability, and estimated kidney, heart,
 and pelvic fat. Heifers from Sm-sired dams were heavier (P &lt;
 .05) than those from all other groups but ranked second to
 heifers from P for percentage of cutability. Marbling scores
 of RP heifer carcasses ranked highest of all groups. Breed was
 not significant (P &gt; .05) for any of the weights or gains in
 steer progeny of 3- to 6-yr-old dams; however, the Sm and P
 groups ranked above A and RP for all feedlot test weights.

 Abstract:  A previous version of Lone Star Tick Simulation
 Model (LSTSIM) for a wildlife ecosystem was revised and
 expanded to include a beef cattle forage area and improved
 handling of tick-host- habitat interactions. Relationships
 between environmental and biological variables were also
 refined in the new version. General validity of the revised
 model was established by comparing simulated and observed
 host-seeking populations of Amblyomma americanum (L.) at five
 geographic locations, three in Oklahoma and two in Kentucky-
 Tennessee. Additional validity was indicated from comparisons
 of simulated and observed seasonality of lone star ticks at
 one location in Kentucky. The model produced acceptable values
 for initial population growth rate, generation time, and 15-yr
 population density when historical weather files for 14
 locations in the United States were used. The model of A.
 americanum population dynamics was used to study the
 relationship between tick density and density of white-tailed
 deer, Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman), and cattle. The
 revised model can be used for additional simulation studies on
 effects of tick control technologies and integrated management
 strategies.

 Abstract:  Feedlot and carcass traits of nulliparous and
 primiparous females representing eight breed types, including
 Bos taurus and Bos indicus X Bos taurus crosses, were
 evaluated. Nulliparous females (heifers) were in the feedlot
 for 4 mo; primiparous females (heiferettes) were fed for 2 1/3
 mo after their calves were weaned at 6 mo of age. Heifers
 averaged higher (P &lt; .01) in dressing percentage, percentage
 of kidney fat, carcass grade (P &lt; .10), and color of lean (P &lt;
 .05) compared with heiferettes. Heiferettes exceeded the
 nulliparous group in feedlot ADG (P &lt; .01), fat thickness (P &lt;
 .05), and percentage of steak, roast, and bone (P &lt; .01).
 Parity effects on carcass weight, longissimus area, marbling,
 pH, and shear force value were not statistically significant.
 Dam breed types differed in several traits, including marbling
 (P &lt; .05) and percentage of steak (P &lt; .10), roast (P &lt; .01),
 and bone (P &lt; .01). Dam breed X parity interactions were
 nonsignificant. Results show that beef derived from
 heiferettes is competitive with heifer beef.

 Abstract:  Since short duration grazing (SDG) was introduced
 to Texas, concern for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
 virginianus) has magnified because they are a species of major
 economic importance to ranchers. The objective of this study
 was to observe the effects of SDG and continuous yearlong
 grazing (CG) on home ranges and movement indices of female
 deer, and on forage availability. The study was conducted on
 the Rob and Bessie Welder Wildlife Refuge, near Sinton, Texas.
 The study area included a 10-pasture SDG cell and a CG
 pasture, each stocked at 2.8 ha/auy. Cattle grazed each SDG
 paddock 2 to 8 days; paddocks were rested 32 to 47 days. A
 total of 3,961 radio-fixes from 11 does was collected over an
 11-month study period in 1983. Monthly and annual home ranges
 of does were similar (P &gt; 0.05) between SDG (207 ha) and CG
 (229 ha). However, white-tailed deer traveled 35% more (P &lt;
 0.05) between fixes in SDG (449 m) than in CG (332 m) from May
 to August, a time of greatest physiological and nutritional
 stress for female deer in south Texas. Also, does avoided (P &lt;
 0.05) cattle during 2 cycles of the SDG rotation. The primary
 trend observed was for the deer under SDG to avoid cattle
 concentrations by alternating between preferred habitats
 rather than a predictable paddock-to-paddock movement. In
 general, there were few differences in total grass and forb
 cover between SDG and CG. However, several forage species
 important to deer were less frequent (P &lt; 0.05) under SDG than
 CG.

 Abstract:  Nonpregnant F1 crossbred cows, progeny of either
 Hereford (H) or Angus (A) dams and sired by Brahman (Bm),
 Sahiwal (Sw), Pinzgauer (Pz), H or A sires, were fed to
 maintain initial weight while rearing Charolais (C)-sired
 progeny for a period of 126 d in drylot commencing at about 48
 d postpartum. Cow-calf pairs were assigned to equalize cow
 age, calf sex, and breed of cow's dam among three replicate
 pens of approximately 12 pairs each. Cows and calves were
 weighed every 2 wk and feed intake was adjusted to minimize
 change in cow weight. Metabolizable energy (ME) consumption
 for zero cow weight change was estimated by regression. Milk
 production was estimated by weigh-suckle, weigh at 58, 85,
 125, and 170 d of lactation. Calf gain (GAIN, kg) relative to
 cow weight (CWT 1, kg) was higher (P &lt; .01) for calves from
 Bm-X (139.5/585) and Sw-X (132.2/534) than for calves from Pz-
 X (127.2/552) and HA-X (116.9/547) cows. Estimated mean daily
 production of milk was 7.40, 7.15, 7.28, and 6.37 kg for the
 Bm-X, Sw-X, Pz-.X, and HA-X, respectively. Total cow ME intake
 (TME cow) for breed groups ranked (P &lt; .05) with cow size and
 milk production, and calf creep-feed intake (FME calf) was
 inversely related to estimated milk intake. Proportion of
 total feed ME (TME cow+calf) consumed by calves was higher (P
 &lt; .05) for HA-X cows (18%) than for the others (14%). Total
 efficiency of calf gain in weight (GAIN/TME cow+calf) was 11 %
 greater (P &lt; .05) for crossbred cows of Bos indicus X Bos
 taurus Bm-X, Sw-X) than for Bos taurus X Bos taurus (Pz-X, HA-
 X) cows (35 vs 32 g/Mcal) in the 126-d lactation period.

 Abstract:  The development of different traits was studied in
 tropical beef bulls of seven genotypes (Brahman, Africander,
 British and combinations of these) from approximately 500 to
 910 d of age. Bulls were raised under pasture conditions
 without supplementation. At each examination, approximately 2
 mo apart, bulls were weighed, palpated (including scrotal and
 testicular measurement), electroejaculated, and subjected to
 two libido tests with estrus-induced females. At alternate
 examinations, plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) was measured at
 30 and 150 min post gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH)
 injection (LH - 30 and LH - 150) and testosterone (T) was
 measured at 150 min (T - 150). In general, nutritional and
 environmental stressors appeared to impede bull reproductive
 development. Scrotal circumference increased nonlinearly,
 apparently influenced by puberty and average daily gain (ADG).
 Libido increased overall, albeit nonlinearly also. No apparent
 marked differences in development of either trait could be
 attributed to genotype differences, although Brahman bulls
 tended to display lower sexual interest. The LH-30 level was
 relatively high (&gt;14 ng/ml) at 500 and 640 d of age, but then
 dropped markedly at 760 d followed by a slight recovery. The
 LH-150 level followed a similar pattern, although d was very
 low at 500 d of age. The T-150 level showed a reverse pattern,
 being lower initially and higher in the latter part of the
 study. No apparent genotype differences occurred. Possible
 contributory influences on these patterns, including the onset
 of puberty and sexual maturity, season and nutrition, are
 discussed herein.

 Abstract:  A total of 268 crossbred, 6- to 9-mo-old, bull
 calves (214 +/- 19 kg) were used in two separate 27-d
 experiments to assess the effects of butorphanol and xylazine
 administration (BXA) on the subsequent performance and health
 of beef calves. In each experiment, calves were randomly
 allotted to four treatment groups: 1) castration with BXA, 2)
 castration without BXA, 3) no castration with BXA, and 4) no
 castration without BXA. There were two replicates within each
 experiment. The intravenous administration of .07 mg/kg of
 butorphanol and .02 mg/kg of xylazine occurred 90 s before
 tail hold and castration procedures. Calves were placed in a
 squeeze chute and manually restrained by tail elevation. In
 Exp. 2, the cattle also were scored for chute activity (on a 1
 to 5 scale with 5 being the most active). Cattle were weighed
 at the beginning and end of the experiment, feed intake was
 recorded daily, and cattle were monitored daily for
 respiratory disease. There were no castration X BXA
 interactions (P &gt; .51). Castration reduced (P &lt; .01) daily
 gain and gain/feed and tended (P = .13) to reduce feed intake.
 The administration of BXA had no effect (P &gt; .05) on gain or
 gain/feed but did tend (P = .13) to reduce feed intake. No
 differences (P &gt; .45) were observed in morbidity or mortality
 due to either BXA or castration. Castration and BXA increased
 (P &lt; .01) blood cortisol levels on d 3, whereas control
 animals had reduced cortisol levels. Castration increased (P &lt;
 .05) haptoglobin levels on d 3, but BXA had no effect (P &gt;
 .05) on serum haptoglobin concentrations on d 3. Chute
 activity was reduced (P &lt; .05) by castration and BXA. In this
 study, animal performance was reduced by castration. The
 administration of BXA did not alter stress indicators or
 improve performance of castrated bull calves. Serum
 haptoglobin may be a more specific indicator of the
 inflammatory process in cattle, whereas serum cortisol may be
 an indicator of the whole-body stress response.

 Abstract:  Opinions on expected support of animal breeding and
 genetics research into the next decade were requested from
 heads of Departments of Animal Science and directors of
 agricultural experiment stations in the Southern Region and
 from directors of agricultural experiment stations outside the
 Southern Region. A majority of administrators in all three
 groups expect a reduction in assignment of state appropriated
 funds for beef cattle breeding research compared with total
 support available. Cattle numbers and land areas assigned to
 breeding and genetics research may be more limited in the
 future. Directors of agricultural experiment stations expect
 animal breeding scientists to work more closely with
 scientists in biotechnology and to become more involved in
 multidisciplinary research to reduce the costs associated with
 maintaining large herds of cattle. Departments of Animal
 Science do not expect to reduce significantly the number of
 animal breeding positions, but they may reassign some that
 come open to balance departmental opportunities. Animal
 breeding scientists will be needed to educate graduate
 students, teach classes, and handle research responsibilities
 as in the past.

 Abstract:  Data from 1,277 single and 85 twin calvings,
 occurring in both spring and fall from 1980 through 1987, were
 used to examine the productivity and profitability associated
 with twin births in beef cattle. Pregnancies in pure and
 crossbred cattle resulted from both AI and embryo transfer.
 Cows and calves were confinement-housed. Cows were
 individually fed to specification. Calves were given ad
 libitum access to creep feed and those born in 1986 and 1987
 were fed to slaughter. The influence of birth number on
 gestation length, total calf birth and weaning weights,
 lactation yield, and cow feed intake during both the dry and
 lactating periods was examined. Twin-bearing cows had their
 gestation length shortened by 6.4 d (2%); yielded 25.5 (59)
 and 186.0 kg (73%) more weight of calf at birth and weaning,
 respectively; had lactation yield and lactation feed intake
 increased by 25 and 20%, respectively; and had precalving
 (dry) period feed intake no different from their single-
 bearing counterparts (P = .12). Postweaning growth was not
 different for single and twin calves (P = .50); twin gain,
 relative to initial size, was higher. Feedlot feed intake of
 twins was 85% of that for singletons (P = .20). Twins were 90%
 of singleton live weight at slaughter and yielded 93% of
 singleton hot carcass weight (P = .12). Twins were slightly
 older and significantly leaner at slaughter. Returns less feed
 costs showed twin births to be associated with increased
 profit for cow-calf programs. Returns less feed and overhead
 costs were higher for twin calves than for singles in the
 feedlot.

 Abstract:  Two beef production systems were evaluated in
 conjunction with an evaluation of escape protein sources for
 finishing calves. Two hundred forty crossbred steers and 80
 crossbred heifer calves (BW = 267 +/- 2 kg) were split into
 two groups: 1) control, finished (207 d) after a 3-wk feedlot
 adjustment period and 2) grazing cornstalks for 74 d after a
 3-wk feedlot adjustment period, then finished (164 d).
 Finishing treatments were sources and proportions of
 supplemental CP: 1) urea 100%; 2) soybean meal (SBM) 100%; 3)
 blood meal (BM) 50%, urea 50%; 4) feather meal (FTH) 50%, urea
 50%; 5) SBM 50%, FTH 25%, urea 25%; 6) SBM 25%, FTH 38%, urea
 37%; 7) FTH 25%, BM 25%, urea 50%, and 8) FTH 38%, BM 13%,
 urea 50%. Treatments 1 to 8 were fed in dry-rolled corn (DRC)-
 based diets. Treatments 9 and 10 were supplement Treatments 1
 and 7 fed in diets based on high-moisture corn. Calves
 finished after a 74-d period of grazing cornstalks consumed
 more feed (P &lt; .01) and gained faster (P &lt; .01) but were less
 efficient (P &lt; .05) than calves finished directly after
 weaning. Although not statistically different, calves finished
 after grazing cornstalks and supplemented with natural protein
 in the feedlot were 7% more efficient than calves supplemented
 with urea alone. Efficiency of calves finished directly after
 weaning was similar for calves supplemented with natural
 protein or urea alone. Supplementing SBM/ FTH/urea or
 BM/FTH/urea improved feed efficiency compared with
 supplementing FTH/urea alone. These data suggest that allowing
 calves to graze cornstalks before finishing is a possible
 management option, but this system may require more
 metabolizable protein in the finishing diet to maximize feed
 efficiency if the calves are expressing compensatory growth.

 Abstract:  Domestic farm animals play an important role in
 meeting some basic needs of humankind, especially food and
 clothing. The aspects of genetic improvement programs in
 livestock production pertinent to animal welfare and animal
 well-being are reviewed. A link is made between the
 evolutionary processes of adaptation and domestication and
 animal well-being. Animal behavior is a component of all
 these. Thus, the genetics of behavior may provide clues to the
 well-being of farm animal populations, and it will also be of
 relevance to public opinion issues of animal welfare. Many
 expressions of behavior by domestic livestock may be
 influenced by those processes that change gene as well as
 genotypic frequencies such as inbreeding, drift, and
 artificial selection. The environment in which the individual
 lives will also play a role, along with the interaction
 between genotype and environment. Selection for or against
 such behaviors as aggressiveness, docility, response to
 stress, and certain sexual behaviors in some livestock species
 has often been successful. This points to the existence of
 additive genetic variation for behavior, and scope for the
 inclusion of behavioral traits into selection programs, if
 these measures are shown to be related to welfare. Negative
 relationships between behaviors associated with well-being and
 traits of economic importance have been reported in most
 livestock species. However, estimates of genetic parameters,
 especially genetic correlations between objective measures of
 well-being and production traits, are scarce. There have been
 no comprehensive studies of the welfare of transgenic animals
 reported in the scientific literature. Increased use of
 biotechnology in animal agriculture, coupled with greater
 public scrutiny of livestock industries, may precipitate
 decisions concerning the interface of behavior and genetics
 that need to be addressed before scientists can conduct
 appropriate experimental evaluations.

 Abstract:  The objectives of this study were to determine the
 efficacy of various doses of rbST on ADG and feed efficiency
 (FE) and to describe carcass composition changes in finishing
 beef steers. In Exp. 1, 96 crossbred beef steers (393 kg)
 received daily i.m. injections of buffer or 33, 100, or 300
 microgram/kg of BW of rbst (0ST, 33ST, 1OOST, 300ST). In Exp.
 2, 200 crossbred beef steers (417 kg) received daily i.m.
 injections of buffer or 8.25, 16.5, 33, or 66 microgram/kg of
 BW of rbST (0ST, 8.25ST, 16.5ST, 33ST, 66ST). Treatments were
 administered until steer BW per pen averaged 540 kg in Exp. 1
 and 560 kg in Exp. 2. An 86% concentrate:14% roughage diet was
 fed once daily (CP: 16.5% in Exp. 1, 20.2% in Exp. 2). In Exp.
 1, growth performance of steers receiving rbst was dose-
 dependent; ADG changed linearly (P = .01), DMI decreased
 linearly (P = .03), and FE changed quadratically (P &lt; .03).
 The 33ST steers responded with improved ADG and FE, 100ST with
 improved FE, and 300ST with lower ADG and poorer FE, compared
 with 0ST. In Exp. 2, the ADG response was quadratic (P = .01),
 DMI decreased linearly (P = .003), and FE improved
 quadratically (P = .004) with increasing dose of rbst. Steers
 receiving 16.5ST and 33ST responded with improved ADG and FE,
 whereas steers receiving 8.25ST and 66ST responded with
 improved FE but not ADG relative to 0ST steers. In Exp. 1 and
 2, rbST administration altered carcass composition by
 increasing carcass protein and decreasing carcass fat. Our
 results indicate that a daily dose between 16.5 and 33
 microgram/kg of BW was required to optimize both ADG and FE in
 finishing beef steers; however, the dose response for changes
 in carcass chemical composition had not attained a plateau
 even at 300 microgram/kg of BW.

 Abstract:  A reflective roof coating was demonstrated to
 reduce temperatures by 2 to 3 degrees C (3.6 to 5.4 degrees F)
 in totally enclosed poultry housing with no ventilation.
 However, similar results did not occur in studies of well-
 ventilated poultry and dairy housing. Reductions in roof
 temperatures of well-ventilated housing did occur, but similar
 reductions were not found in interior dry bulb or black globe
 temperatures at animal level and no production benefits
 resulted. Reflective coatings can reduce the temperature of
 galvanized steel roofing material and the temperatures of
 enclosed attics. However, these coatings add expense to
 structures and their effectiveness drops rapidly with time as
 they weather and accumulate dirt. They are most beneficial for
 poorly ventilated structures. For well-ventilated structures,
 they do not offer great benefits. The addition of reflective
 coatings will seldom be economically justified for well-
 ventilated livestock and poultry structures.

 Abstract:  On conifer plantations, competitive understory
 vegetation often retards growth and establishment of tree
 seedlings. Livestock grazing exemplifies a method of
 controlling the understory vegetation and increasing the
 availability of site resources to tree seedings. We
 hypothesized that prescribed cattle grazing ameliorates water
 stress of young tree seedlings by reducing root growth of
 competing understory species. On a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
 menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
 Dougl.) plantation in southwest Oregon planted in 1986,
 seedling water stress was evaluated with the pressure chamber
 technique and supplemented with gravimetric sod water
 determinations in 1986-1989. Root growth of orchardgrass
 (Dactylis glomerata L.), the major understory competing
 species, was quantified in 1988 and 1989 with the root
 periscope/mini-rhizotron technique. Seedling water stress
 levels during spring and summer were similar in a cattle-
 grazed vs. ungrazed area in 1986 through 1988, but in summer
 1989, water stress was reduced significantly in the grazed
 area. Soil water content was higher in the grazed area in
 1989, especially at the 10-20 cm soil depth. End of season
 (July) orchardgrass root growth was reduced 18% and 15% with
 grazing in 1988 and 1989, respectively. We conclude that
 repeated cattle grazing of orchardgrass reduced
 transpirational surface area and root growth sufficiently to
 increase soil water availability to seedlings. Thus,
 prescribed cattle grazing on conifer plantations can enhance
 seedling physiological status by acting as a regulator of
 above- and belowground competition.

 Abstract:  This study determined the influence of the
 estrogenic ear implant Synovex-S on feedlot performance,
 tissue deposition, and thyroid status of growing-finishing
 beef steers implanted either once or reimplanted. The pattern
 of implant absorption was also determined. Two 112-d feeding
 trials were used with 48 Hereford steers per trial, Each trial
 was a randomized block design with eight groups (lots) of six
 steers each assigned to four treatments (two lots/treatment).
 Treatments were 1) no implant or control, 2) implanted on d 0
 and reimplanted at 60 d on trial, 3) implanted at 30 d on
 trial, and 4) implanted on d 0 only. These implant treatments
 resulted in withdrawal periods before slaughter of
 approximately 60, 90 and 120 d for Treatments 2, 3, and 4,
 respectively. All steers were given ad libitum access to water
 and a 60% concentrate diet. Group intakes were determined
 daily, BW weekly, estimated body composition every 28 d,
 plasma thyroid hormone concentrations at 112 d and at
 slaughter, and carcass measurements and liver tissue
 deiodinase at slaughter. Approximately 25% of the original
 implant dose remained in the ear 60 d after implanting and
 this residual amount was absorbed linearly at the rate of
 approximately .15% of the original dose per day. Implant
 treatments increased (P &lt; .05) DMI, BW gain, feed conversion,
 and empty body gains for water and protein. Carcass
 measurements suggested a nonsignificant trend (P &gt; .10) for
 leaner carcasses for implanted steers. An immediate shift
 toward greater protein and less fat deposition occurred within
 28 d after initial implanting (Treatment 3). The ratio of
 plasma thyroxine to triiodothyronine was slightly higher and
 liver deiodinase slightly lower in implanted steers. There
 were no differences between the steers implanted once and
 those reimplanted at 60 d. These data are interpreted to show
 no benefit to reimplanting beef steers at 60 d with Synovex-S.

 Abstract:  We tested whether resistance of lymphocytes to heat
 stress is modified by breed, intracellular glutathione
 content, and extracellular antioxidants. In the first
 experiment, lymphocytes from Angus (Bos taurus, non-heat-
 tolerant), Brahman (B. indicus, heat-tolerant), and Senepol
 (B. taurus, heat-tolerant) heifers (12 heifers per breed) were
 cultured at 45 degrees C for 3 h to evaluate thermal killing,
 at 42 degrees C for 12 h in a 60-h phytohemagglutinin-induced
 proliferation test, and at 42 degrees C for 1 h to measure
 induction of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Killing at 45
 degrees C was affected by breed X temperature (P &lt; .01); the
 decrease in viability caused by a temperature of 45 degrees C
 was greater for Angus than for Brahman or Senepol. For
 phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes, heating to 42
 degrees C reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation equally for all
 breeds. Viability at the end of culture was affected (P &lt;
 .001) by a breed X temperature interaction because the
 decrease in viability caused by culture at 42 degrees C was
 greatest for lymphocytes from Angus heifers. Heat shock for 1
 h at 42 degrees C caused a two- to threefold increase in
 intracellular concentrations of HSP70, but there was no
 interaction of temperature with breed. In another experiment
 (with lymphocytes harvested from three Holstein cows),
 buthionine sulfoximine, a glutathione synthesis inhibitor,
 inhibited (P &lt; .01) proliferation of phytohemagglutinin-
 stimulated lymphocytes at 38.5 and 42 degrees C. Addition of
 the antioxidants glutathione or thioredoxin to culture did not
 reduce the effects of heating to 42 degrees C on
 proliferation. In summary, lymphocyte resistance to heat shock
 differed between breeds. There was no evidence that this
 effect is caused by differential HSP70 synthesis. Although
 intracellular antioxidant status affected lymphocyte
 proliferation, exogenous glutathione or thioredoxin did not
 overcome the effects of heat shock.

 Abstract:  Malodorous emissions from livestock buildings are
 caused by waste products, particularly manure. The published
 information on how waste management practices influence odour
 production and emission has been reviewed, but the shortage of
 objective odour measurements makes it difficult to give
 practical recommendations with confidence. Some
 recommendations for research are, however, proposed. The main
 factors in livestock management have been analysed; these are
 waste removal, waste decomposition, design of the floor of the
 building, treatments that may be applied to the waste within
 the building (e.g. changing its pH) and the use of bedding
 materials. The interactions between most of these factors
 confound the analysis, but the evidence indicates that the
 main options for reducing odour production, odour emission or
 odour nuisance are frequent waste removal from buildings, or
 the prevention of anaerobic conditions developing in the
 waste. Reduction of the moisture content of the waste has been
 reported to reduce odour production. This may work by
 inhibiting the development of anaerobic conditions and it may
 explain why the use of bedding has been found to reduce odour.
 However, adequate odour measurement data on using different
 bedding materials and on other waste management practices must
 be gathered before any firm conclusions can be drawn. The
 relevance of information on emissions of ammonia from
 livestock buildings is briefly considered. Although ammonia
 concentrations in air do not show a good correlation with
 odour strength, nevertheless any step taken to reduce the
 ammonia emissions from a livestock building ought also to
 reduce the odour emissions and vice versa.

 Abstract:  The impetus to find alternative methods to
 stressful routine management procedures has increased in
 recent years in the hope of improving animal welfare. The
 potential of using depigmenting compounds to create a
 permanent visible mark was evaluated in two beef heifers.
 Eight compounds (hydroquinone [H], 4-ethoxyphenol [4-EP], 4-
 methylcatechol [4-MC], 4-tert-butylcatechol [4-t-BC], 4-
 methoxyphenol [4-MP], monobenzone [M], hydroquinone bis (2-
 hydroxyethyl) ether (HHEE), and catechol [C]) were injected
 intradermally at concentrations of 10 and 20%. These compounds
 were screened in four different carriers (ethanol, glycerol,
 propylene glycol, and liposome cream) to test their
 effectiveness in producing depigmented hair. Transdermal
 dermal patches containing 5, 7, and 10% liposome preparations
 of 4-MC and 4-MP produced depigmentation, but this
 depigmentation was not as visible as when the same
 preparations were injected. Histological examination of
 biopsies and observations of the injected sites were compared
 to sites that were only injected with the carrier solution.
 Compounds H, 4-EP, 4-MC, 4-t-BC, 4-MP, and M produced visible
 depigmentation lasting up to 3 mo. The duration of the effect
 seemed dependent on the hair cycle length and stage of cycle
 at time of application. None of the depigmenting compounds
 tested produced a permanent depigmenting effect.

 Abstract:  A course is described in which students are taught
 principles of livestock behavior and how an understanding of
 behavior can facilitate handling. Some of the principles that
 are covered in the course are livestock senses, flight zone,
 herd behavior during handing, and methods to reduce stress
 during handling. To teach problem solving and original
 thinking, the students design three different types of
 handling facilities. Design of restraint equipment and humane
 slaughter procedures are also covered. Both existing systems
 and ideas for future systems are discussed. Students are
 provided with information from both scientific studies and
 practical experience.

 Abstract:  Two experiments were conducted at three locations
 to determine the correct dosage and carrier for trenbolone
 acetate (TBA) and estradiol (E2) implants in feedlot steers.
 In the dose-response experiment, 1,296 steers were allotted to
 six implant treatments (48 pens per location): control, 140 mg
 of TBA (140/0), 30 mg of E2 (0/30), 20 mg of TBA + 4 mg of
 E2(20/4), 80 mg of TBA + 16 mg of E2(80/16), and 140 mg of TBA
 + 28 mg of E2 (140/28). In the carrier experiment, 575 steers
 were allotted to five implant treatments (25 pens per
 location): control, 140 mg of TBA + 28 mg of E2 in lactose
 (140/28-LA), 140 mg of TBA + 28 mg of E2 in cholesterol
 (140/28-CH), 140 mg of TBA + 20 mg of E2 in LA (140/20-LA),
 and 200 mg of progesterone + 20 mg of E2 benzoate (SS,
 reimplanted). In both experiments steers were fed a finishing
 diet for 140 to 168 d. In the dose-response experiment,
 response to TBA alone (140/0) did not differ from control (P &gt;
 .2). Estradiol alone (0/30) improved ADG by 7% (P &lt; .01) and
 tended to improve feed efficiency over control (3%, P = .17).
 The highest dosage (140/28) improved ADG by 18% (P &lt; .001) and
 feed efficiency by 10% (P &lt; .001) over control and 10% (P &lt;
 .001) and 7% (P &lt; .01) over E2 alone, respectively. In the
 carrier experiment, all implant treatments increased steer
 performance over control (P &lt; .01); no differences in response
 were observed (P &gt; .2) between LA and CH carriers or between
 28 and 20 mg of E2 in combination with 140 mg of TBA. Implant
 treatments, in general, decreased (P &lt; .05) carcass fatness
 and quality grade; little difference was noted in carcass
 characteristics between E2 alone and treatments containing
 TBA. Combinations of TBA/E2 were more effective enhancers of
 steer performance under U.S. conditions than was either E2 or
 TBA alone (Exp. 1), and combinations were similar to SS-
 reimplanted (Exp. 2).

 Cage size
 
 Abstract:  Handling livestock can be a hazardous and
 frustrating operation especially when access to the animal is
 required for procedures such as pregnancy testing of cattle or
 other reproductive examinations. A handling facility that
 gently restrains the animal in an adjustable dimension cage
 can contribute to a smooth operation and increased safety for
 the operator as well as the animal. A system was designed to
 mechanically adjust the width of the cage and the position of
 the front restraint so the cage precisely fits the animal and
 positions the animal against the leg bar at the rear of the
 cage. The width and position can be changed over the entire
 span of each motion control device and can be adjusted for
 each animal after the animal is in place. The system has been
 tested at the Fort Keogh Livestock and Range Research
 Laboratory. Cattle are handled easily with a minimum of stress
 and the controls are easy to operate.
