        Joey Gallo was a mafia dude who was shot by some other mafia dudes.
Supposedly <A HREF="../l/levyjacques.html">Jacques Levy</A> (his coauthor of some of the Desire lyrics) told
Bob that Joey was a nice guy and nice to kids and stuff, so Bob wrote a
song about him.  Apparently Joey shot some other mob guy so that guy's
family killed him.  In Tim Riley's brilliant Dylan commentary, "Hard Rain",
(a definite must-read for Dylan fans) he discusses this song and says that
Joey was actually a wife and child abuser as well as a racist.  So, Bob
must've not done much reading on the guy.

Joey Gallo was a NY (Brooklyn) Mobster who was a fairly interesting 
character.  He was killed at Umberto's Clam house (which recently 
closed) while eating dinner with his family.  He was known as Crazy Joe. <P>

 The rest of the mob didn't like him because he didn't follow rules and 
also because he included blacks in his gang.  He was not a typical 
mobster--he had an awareness of things outside the mob such as 
philosophy art and literature and wasn't a bad painter either.  Still, 
he was a vicious, crazy lunatic and not the hero Dylan paints him to be 
though he was worshipped by the people in his Brooklyn neighborhood. <P>
 
For more info, find a copy of "Joey" by Donald Goddard available at one 
time from Dell Paperbacks.<P>
