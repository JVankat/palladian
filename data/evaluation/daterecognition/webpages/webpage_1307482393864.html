several traits that are similar to or usually associated with
squirrels. </font>
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Times New Roman;"
 lang="EN-AU">Squirrel Girl has enhanced strength, speed, agility, and
reflexes; her metabolism is likely quite high, requiring regular
feedings. She has small claws on each digit to enhance her gripping and
climbing, enlarged incisors and a retractable knuckle spike able to
carve through solid wood, and a bushy semi-prehensile tail which she
can use to cover others&#8217; eyes or wrap around herself for warmth. She
can leap several stories, and she can perfectly mimic squirrel sounds,
as well as actually communicate with and direct the actions of
squirrels. She often uses a number of squirrels to distract or even
assault others, chewing through circuitry and other materials. She
shares a close, possibly empathic, bond<b> </b>with certain squirrels,
such as Monkey Joe and Tippy-Toe.</span><span

(Marvel Super-Heroes III#8) - In the woodlands near Stark
Enterprises, Squirrel Girl encountered Dr. Doom while on the way
to meet Iron Man. Squirrel Girl jumped on a low flying Iron Man
while he was testing an experimental radar system. After they
both crash-landed, Squirrel Girl introduced herself and her
abilities to Iron Man in order to win him over as a super-heroic
partner. Unfortunately, Iron Man was not impressed, but before he
could leave Dr. Doom disabled his armor and knocked him
unconscious with a pulse-interruption ray. A tractor beam then
hoisted all three of them into Doom&#8217;s flying craft. </font></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><font size="2">Squirrel Girl and Iron Man were both
imprisoned
within the same deathtrap; Iron Man was secured by energy
draining bonds, but Squirrel Girl was unfettered within their
prison. Spotting a vent, Squirrel Girl was able to open it and
call for her squirrel friends. The squirrels jumped aboard the
ship from the treetops, chewed through wiring, disabled Iron
Man&#8217;s bonds, and attacked Dr. Doom. While he was being
gnawed on, Iron Man and Squirrel Girl encountered Doom. Rather
than meet defeat by squirrels, Doom opened an escape hatch,
disappearing into a nearby river. Iron Man gave chase while
Squirrel Girl waited shore-side but Doom escaped. </font></font></p>

Monkey
Joe relocated to Manhattan, New York, operating out of Central
Park.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(GLA#2) - Squirrel Girl and Monkey Joe
took out
a pair of muggers threatening Doorman and Flatman, after which
the two GLA'ers invited her to join. When they ok'd Monkey Joe
joining as well, she agreed, and she almost instantly joined them
on a mission to investigate an alarm. The four GLA'ers attempted
to assist <a
 href="http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/grasshoppergla.htm">Grasshopper</a>
against Batroc's Brigade (though he was
doing quite well on his own). Squirrel Girl and Monkey Joe were
present during the less-than-six-second interval between
Grasshopper's joining the GLA and being killed by Zaran. Squirrel
Girl and Monkey Joe wondered whether they'd made a mistake in
joining, but Squirrel Girl decided that she was not a quitter.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(GLA#3) - Squirrel Girl and Monkey Joe
arrived
at GLA headquarters, and Doorman began trying to spook her by
showing her all of the members who had died. When the GLA went to
investigate the scene of the first crime, Flatman recommended
that Squirrel Girl remain behind on monitor duty. Not wanting to
miss out on super hero stuff, she refused, recommending Monkey
Joe stay behind instead. When Doorman questioned Monkey Joe's
abilities (since he was a rodent, after all), Squirrel Girl
argued that Monkey Joe had once defeated Dr. Doom. When she asked
for a show of hands of who else present had taken out Dr. Doom,
the other GLA'ers were forced to yield to her wishes. While
Flatman questioned the designers of the Chronal Accelerator at
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Doorman kept trying to scare
Squirrel Girl. Doorman apologized soon after, revealing that he
was trying to scare away new members to prevent their deaths. She
then offered him a nut from her nutsack.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the same time, Leatherboy, a
former member of the GLA who had been expelled for not having
powers, invaded GLA HQ, broke Mr. Immortal's neck and then
attacked and killed Monkey Joe.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(GLA#4) - Squirrel Girl was excited
about
opposing Maelstrom and his Cosmic Crunch, which could be their
biggest adventure ever, but she was devastated upon returning to
GLA HQ and learning of Monkey Joe's death: <i>"He was a good
squirrel. My best friend. I love you."</i> Afterwards, she
had no interest in going after Maelstom, but Mr. Immortal
reminded her that if the whole universe was destroyed, all the
squirrels would be, too. Determined to prevent this, she summoned
an army of squirrels to help her, <i>"Chhrt Cheet Cuk Cuk Cuk!"</i>
Upon confronting Maelstrom and his lackeys, Batroc's Brigade, she
sent the army of squirrels after Machete, reminding them that
this one was for Monkey Joe. The vortex generated by Maelstrom
pulled the squirrels into it, but Squirrel Girl managed to save
one of them, whom she named Tippy-Toe (though she considered
Monkey Joe 2). </font></font></p>

a scarf for Squirrel Girl. It was colored to match his own costumed
form.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(GLX-Mas Special#1) - Squirrel Girl
was narrating the prologue to the comic special, when Doorman
interrupted her and asked her to pick up some eggnog and toilet paper
for the party. En route to the store aboard her Squirrel-a-Gig with
Tippy-Toe, she saw a laser-fight and touched down. With "Dum Dum"
Dugan's blessing, she and Tippy-Toe took out MODOK, who was trying to
steal equipment from Maelstrom's former base. Dodging MODOK's blasts,
she and Tippy-Toe disabled his exoskeleton and he surrendered. Citing
her impressive record, Dugan offered her a position with S.H.I.E.L.D.,
but she turned him down as she already had a team of her own.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squirrel-Girl returned to the party with the eggnog,
but forgot the toilet paper and headed out again and came across the
spaceship of Thanos, who planned to charge his Pyramatrix with the life
force of everyone on Earth and then conquer the universe.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(GLX-Mas Special#1 - BTS) - Squirrel
Girl defeated Thanos.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(GLX-Mas Special#1) - Uatu the Watcher
appeared, congratulating on saving the entire multiverse, and he
further confirmed that it was "the one, true Thanos" she had defeated,
and "not a robot, clone, or simulacrum."</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(GLX-Mas Special#1) - Later, at the
GLX party, Squirrel Girl asked Doorman if he had any plans for
Christmas Eve, and he replied that he had to see his dad.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later still, Dum Dum Dugan called Squirrel Girl to
help stop Terrax, who was on a rampage downtown. Feeling that Tippy-Toe
had had a busy day, she asked her girl-squirrel to stay home and sit
this one out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Christmas morning, Doorman gave Squirrel Girl a
hat that matched his own costumed eyes. She and the other GLX'ers were
pleased to see the Christmas star in the sky, though only Doorman was
aware that what they were really seeing was the flaming corpse of <a
 href="http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/grasshopperglx.htm">Grasshopper</a>
(Neil Shelton)'s body as it re-entered the atmosphere.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(I (heart) Marvel: Masked
Intentions#1) - Squirrel Girl fantasized about kissing Speedball, much
to the amusement of Tippy-Toe. Leaving her room of Speedball
memorabilia, she asked Flatman and Mr. Immortal to come with her to
Madison where Speedball was making a public appearance and pose as bad
guys so that she could save Speedball from them. When Mr. Immortal
suggested that she simply introduce herself to him, she complained that
they were making fun of her and stormed off.
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">At Madison, Squirrel Girl caught sight
of Speedball's enemy the Bug-Eyed Voice sneaking up on the Masked
Marvel, and she sprang to Speedball's aid, defeating the villain.
However, no one witnessed her fight, and the police couldn't charge the
Bug-Eyed Voice with anything more than a misdemeanor because he was
only carrying paint-guns. They suggested that she return to the "big
city"-- Milwaukee. Dejected, Squirrel Girl was astonished when
Speedball appeared and thanked her for saving his life and then kissed
her. As he bounced away, she wondered who told him what she had gone,
and suspected Tippy-Toe.
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(Thing II#8 (fb)) - Visiting some
squirrels in Manhattan's Central Park, Squirrel Girl and Tippy-Toe were
drawn to the sounds of a battle between the Thing and the Bi-Beast.
Reasoning that his dual noses made him more susceptible to foul odors,
Squirrel Girl and Tippy-Toe gathered large quantities of garbage that
so distracted the Bi-Beast that the Thing could easily punch him out.
The Thing invited Squirrel Girl and her friends to his upcoming poker
tournament.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font size="2">(Thing II#8) - Squirrel Girl and the
GLX attended the tournament, though Marvel Girl (Rachel Grey) took
offense at the name Great Lakes X-Men and forced Mr. Immortal to pick
another name. He chose GLD/Great Lakes Defenders, but Dr. Strange
denied this as well. Later, after Flatman had won the tournament,
Squirrel Girl and the rest of her teammates sang, "We are the
Champions," leading Mr. Immortal to pick a new name: the GLC/Great
Lakes Champions, despite Hercules' objections.<br>
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2">(Cable &amp; Deadpool#30 (fb)-BTS) -
The morning the Superhuman Registration Act was passed, Squirrel Girl
and the rest of the GLC registered.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">(Cable &amp; Deadpool#30) - Unaware of
the GLC's registering, Deadpool attacked them (minus Squirrel Girl) in
their headquarters. He managed to kill Mr. Immortal (who got better
later) and blew the place (and himself) up in the process. While
recovering, he was attacked and viciously beaten by an enraged Squirrel
Girl. The GLC then turned Deadpool over to the local authorities, who
were unsure what to do with him, as it was the first time they'd
actually caught someone. All the while, Squirrel Girl demanded Deadpool
shut his evil, evil pie-hole.</font></p>
<P><FONT SIZE="2">(Deadpool/GLI: Summer Fun Spectacular#1/2) - The newly-rechristianed Great Lakes Initiative journeyed to Wisconsin to find the source of an inebriation wave which had rendered nearly all of Earth's heroes drunk. Aided by Deadpool, they discovered a hidden A.I.M. base owned by Dr. Tannenbaum where the Olympian god Dionysus had been forced into their machines. The legions of A.I.M. were terrified at the very presence of Squirrel Girl, who they deemed to be the "Anti-Life" and "Slayer of All That Breathes." Afterwards Squirrel Girl gained access to Olympus to return Dionysus and helped Zeus out with a problem with Pluto. Back home the GLI invited Deadpool to join their team as their first reserve member. </FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="2">(Deadpool/GLI: Summer Fun Spectacular#1) - Learning the horrible fate which Speedball had suffered since the destruction of Stamford, Squirrel Girl took off to try and help him. With Tippy-Toe, she broke into Thunderbolts Mountain and tried to console Robbie (now Penance), pointing out that the deaths weren't really his fault. However, Penance was so far gone that he refused to believe her. Still determined to help him, Squirrel Girl went to Latveria and had Dr. Doom let her use his time travel machine so that she could try to save Robbie from his destiny. However, Squirrel Girl and Tippy-Toe wound up in the alternate future of Earth-2992 instead, where a divergent Speedball had been stranded with other time-traveling heroes. Squirrel Girl considered staying there with him so that they could renew their romance, but she discovered that Mr. Immortal was still alive in this future, and he told her to return to the past to help the GLI, who had been overwhelmed by Deadpool's obnoxious behavior since joining the team. Squirrel Girl returned just in time to kick Deadpool out, once again admonishing him for being a "evil, evil man."</FONT>

Although Doom escaped, his

Squirrel Girl was definitely still a minor and in high school during
the Marvel Super-Heroes issue. She didn't mention her age or graduating

have to repeat a credit or two).</font></font></font></p>

encouraging fan boys to write in yo complain about Grasshopper's

live on. The ghosts of friendships and loves remembered. Take succor in
that, while you can. For in the end, all that awaits you is there
black, empty void of oblivion. And above all, remember: eat more nuts."
When Squirrel Girl sent her squirrel army after Machete, exclaiming
"This one's for Monkey Joe," he commented that it wasn't like it would
bring him back or anything. He then headed off into the light...<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nice job on the Squirrel Girl profile. In case you
don't know, there was an SG Fleer-Skybox card. Note that this artist
assumes SG wears clown makeup, and painted&nbsp;her face blue.<br>

Atomic Inverter via the
Internet, he was ambushed by Leatherboy, a former member of the
GLA who had been expelled for not having powers. Leatherboy
performed unnatural acts on him, burned him to death, and stomped
on him. When Deathurge came for Monkey Joe, he took the form of a
squirrel, making himself vulnerable to an assault by Mister

Deathurge, who sought vengeance on the GLX for being stranded on Earth
and being trapped in squirrel form. Later, Tippy-Toe joined Squirrel Girl on her adventure to try and help Speedball, briefly visiting Earth-2992 in the process.</font></font></font></p>
