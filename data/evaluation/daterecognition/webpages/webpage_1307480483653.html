<!-- BEGIN CHAPTER --><TR><TD>(T<FONT SIZE="-1">HE FOLLOWING</FONT> tale was found among the papers of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker, an old gentleman of New <!-- PAGE NUM="77" -->York, who was very curious in the Dutch history of the province, and the manners of the descendants from its primitive settlers. His historical researches, however, did not lie so much among books as among men; for the former are lamentably scanty on his favorite topics; whereas he found the old burghers, and still more their wives, rich in that legendary lore so invaluable to true history. Whenever, therefore, he happened upon a genuine Dutch family, snugly shut up in its low-roofed farmhouse, under a spreading sycamore, he looked upon it as a little clasped volume of black-letter, and studied it with the zeal of a bookworm.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="1"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of all these researches was a history of the province during the reign of the Dutch governors, which he published some years since. There have been various opinions as to the literary character of his work, and, to tell the truth, it is not a whit better than it should be. Its chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy, which indeed was a little questioned on its first appearance, but has since been completely established; and it is how admitted into all historical collections as a book of unquestionable authority.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="2"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gentleman died shortly after the publication of his work, and now that he is dead and gone it cannot do much harm to his memory to say that his time might have been much better employed in weightier labors. He, however, was apt to ride his hobby in his own way; and though it did now and then kick up the dust a little in the eyes of his neighbors and grieve the spirit of some friends, for whom he felt the truest deference and affection, yet his errors and follies are remembered <!-- PAGE NUM="78" -->&#147;more in sorrow than in anger&#148;; and it begins to be suspected that he never intended to injure or offend. But however his memory may be appreciated by critics, it is still held dear among many folk whose good opinion is well worth having; particularly by certain biscuit bakers, who have gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their New Year cakes, and have thus given him a chance for immortality almost equal to the being stamped on a Waterloo medal or a Queen Anne&#146;s farthing.)</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="3"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

Whoever has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Catskill Mountains. They are a dismembered branch of the great Appalachian family, and are seen away to the west of the river, swelling up to a noble height, and lording it over the surrounding country. Every change of season, every change of weather, indeed, every hour of the day, produces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains, and they are regarded by all the good wives, far and near, as perfect barometers. When the weather is fair and settled, they are clothed in blue and purple, and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky; but sometimes, when the rest of the landscape is cloudless, they will gather a hood of gray vapors about their summits, which, in the last rays of the setting sun, will glow and light up like a crown of glory.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="4"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- PAGE NUM="79" -->At the foot of these fairy mountains the voyager may have descried the light smoke curling up from a village whose shingle roofs gleam among the trees, just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the fresh green of the nearer landscape. It is a little village of great antiquity, having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists, in the early times of the province, just about the beginning of the government of the good Peter Stuyvesant (may he rest in peace!), and there were some of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years, with lattice windows, gable fronts surmounted with weathercocks, and built of small yellow bricks brought from Holland.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="5"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same village, and in one of these very houses (which, to tell the precise truth, was sadly time-worn and weather-beaten), there lived many years since, while the country was yet a province of Great Britain, a simple, good-natured fellow, of the name of Rip Van Winkle. He was a descendant of the Van Winkles who figured so gallantly in the chivalrous days of Peter Stuyvesant, and accompanied him to the siege of Fort Christina. He inherited, however, but little of the martial character of his ancestors. I have observed that he was a simple, good-natured man; he was, moreover, a kind neighbor and an obedient, henpecked husband. Indeed, to the latter circumstance might be owing that meekness of spirit which gained him such universal popularity; for those men are most apt to be obsequious and conciliating abroad who are under the discipline of shrews at home. Their tempers, doubtless, are rendered pliant and malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation, and a curtain <!-- PAGE NUM="80" -->lecture is worth all the sermons in the world for teaching the virtues of patience and long-suffering. A termagant wife may, therefore, in some respects, be considered a tolerable blessing; and if so, Rip Van Winkle was thrice blessed.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="6"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain it is that he was a great favorite among all the good wives of the village, who, as usual with the amiable sex, took his part in all family squabbles, and never failed, whenever they talked those matters over in their evening gossipings, to lay all the blame on Dame Van Winkle. The children of the village, too, would shout with joy whenever he approached. He assisted at their sports, made their playthings, taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and told them long stories of ghosts, witches, and Indians. Whenever he went dodging about the village, he was surrounded by a troop of them, hanging on his skirts, clambering on his back, and playing a thousand tricks on him with impunity; and not a dog would bark at him throughout the neighborhood.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="7"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The great error in Rip&#146;s composition was an insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labor. It could not be from the want of assiduity or perseverance; for he would sit on a wet rock, with a rod as long and heavy as a Tartar&#146;s lance, and fish all day without a murmur, even though he should not be encouraged by a single nibble. He would carry a fowling piece on his shoulder, for hours together, trudging through woods and swamps, and up hill and down dale, to shoot a few squirrels or wild pigeons. He would never even refuse to assist a neighbor in the roughest toil, and was a foremost man at all country frolics for husking Indian corn, or building stone <!-- PAGE NUM="81" -->fences. The women of the village, too, used to employ him to run their errands, and to do such little odd jobs as their less obliging husbands would not do for them; in a word, Rip was ready to attend to anybody&#146;s business but his own; but as to doing family duty, and keeping his farm in order, it was impossible.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="8"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he declared it was of no use to work on his farm; it was the most pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country; everything about it went wrong, and would go wrong, in spite of him. His fences were continually falling to pieces; his cow would either go astray or get among the cabbages; weeds were sure to grow quicker in his fields than anywhere else; the rain always made a point of setting in just as he had some outdoor work to do; so that though his patrimonial estate had dwindled away under his management, acre by acre, until there was little more left than a mere patch of Indian corn and potatoes, yet it was the worst-conditioned farm in the neighborhood.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="9"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;His children, too, were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to nobody. His son Rip, an urchin begotten in his own likeness, promised to inherit the habits, with the old clothes of his father. He was generally seen trooping like a colt at his mother&#146;s heels, equipped in a pair of his father&#146;s cast-off galligaskins, which he had much ado to hold up with one hand, as a fine lady does her train in bad weather.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="10"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;10</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rip Van Winkle, however, was one of those happy mortals, of foolish, well-oiled dispositions, who take the world easy, eat white bread or brown, whichever can be got with least thought or trouble, and would rather starve <!-- PAGE NUM="82" -->on a penny than work for a pound. If left to himself, he would have whistled life away, in perfect contentment; but his wife kept continually dinning in his ears about his idleness, his carelessness, and the ruin he was bringing on his family. Morning, noon, and night, her tongue was incessantly going, and everything he said or did was sure to produce a torrent of household eloquence. Rip had but one way of replying to all lectures of the kind, and that, by frequent use, had grown into a habit. He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, cast up his eyes, but said nothing. This, however, always provoked a fresh volley from his wife, so that he was fain to draw off his forces, and take to the outside of the house&#151;the only side which, in truth, belongs to a henpecked husband.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="11"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;11</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rip&#146;s sole domestic adherent was his dog Wolf, who was as much henpecked as his master; for Dame Van Winkle regarded them as companions in idleness, and even looked upon Wolf with an evil eye, as the cause of his master&#146;s so often going astray. True it is, in all points of spirit befitting an honorable dog, he was as courageous an animal as ever scoured the woods&#151;but what courage can withstand the ever-during and all-besetting terrors of a woman&#146;s tongue? The moment Wolf entered the house his crest fell, his tail drooped to the ground, or curled between his legs; he sneaked about with a gallows air, casting many a sidelong glance at Dame Van Winkle, and at the least flourish of a broomstick or ladle would fly to the door with yelping precipitation.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="12"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;12</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as <!-- PAGE NUM="83" -->years of matrimony rolled on; a tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, of a long lazy summer&#146;s day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman&#146;s money to have heard the profound discussions which sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveler. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper, learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary; and how sagely they would deliberate upon public events some months after they had taken place.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="13"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;13</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinions of this junto were completely controlled by Nicholas Vedder, a patriarch of the village, and landlord of the inn, at the door of which he took his seat from morning till night, just moving sufficiently to avoid the sun, and keep in the shade of a large tree; so that the neighbors could tell the hour by his movements as accurately as by a sun-dial. It is true, he was rarely heard to speak, but smoked his pipe incessantly. His adherents, however (for every great man has his adherents), perfectly understood him, and knew how to gather his opinions. When anything that was read or related displeased him, <!-- PAGE NUM="84" -->he was observed to smoke his pipe vehemently, and send forth short, frequent, and angry puffs; but when pleased, he would inhale the smoke slowly and tranquilly, and emit it in light and placid clouds, and sometimes taking the pipe from his mouth, and letting the fragrant vapor curl about his nose, would gravely nod his head in token of perfect approbation.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="14"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;14</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;From even this stronghold the unlucky Rip was at length routed by his termagant wife, who would suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of the assemblage, and call the members all to nought; nor was that august personage, Nicholas Vedder himself, sacred from the daring tongue of this terrible virago, who charged him outright with encouraging her husband in habits of idleness.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="15"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;15</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair; and his only alternative, to escape from the labor of the farm and clamor of his wife, was to take gun in hand and stroll away into the woods. Here he would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree, and share the contents of his wallet with Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a fellow-sufferer in persecution. &#147;Poor Wolf,&#148; he would say, &#147;thy mistress leads thee a dog&#146;s life of it; but never mind, my lad, while I live thou shalt never want a friend to stand by thee!&#148; Wolf would wag his tail, look wistfully in his master&#146;s face, and if dogs can feel pity, I verily believe he reciprocated the sentiment with all his heart.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="16"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;16</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal day, Rip had unconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the Catskill Mountains. He was after his favorite sport of squirrel shooting, and the still solitudes had echoed and re&#235;choed with the reports of his gun. <!-- PAGE NUM="85" -->Panting and fatigued, he threw himself, late in the afternoon, on a green knoll, covered with mountain herbage, that crowned the brow of a precipice. From an opening between the trees he could overlook all the lower country for many a mile of rich woodland. He saw at a distance the lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving on its silent but majestic course, the reflection of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging bark, here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom, and at last losing itself in the blue highlands.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="17"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;17</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side he looked down into a deep mountain glen, wild, lonely, and shagged, the bottom filled with fragments from the impending cliffs, and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of the setting sun. For some time Rip lay musing on this scene; evening was gradually advancing; the mountains began to throw their long blue shadows over the valleys; he saw that it would be dark long before he could reach the village, and he heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the terrors of Dame Van Winkle.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="18"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;18</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;As he was about to descend, he heard a voice from a distance, hallooing, &#147;Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!&#148; He looked around, but could see nothing but a crow winging its solitary flight across the mountain. He thought his fancy must have deceived him, and turned again to descend, when he heard the same cry ring through the still evening air: &#147;Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!&#148;&#151;at the same time Wolf bristled up his back, and giving a low growl, skulked to his master&#146;s side, looking fearfully down into the glen. Rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over him; he looked anxiously in the same <!-- PAGE NUM="86" -->direction, and perceived a strange figure slowly toiling up the rocks, and bending under the weight of something he carried on his back. He was surprised to see any human being in this lonely and unfrequented place, but supposing it to be some one of the neighborhood in need of assistance, he hastened down to yield it.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="19"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;19</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;On nearer approach, he was still more surprised at the singularity of the stranger&#146;s appearance. He was a short, square-built old fellow, with thick bushy hair, and a grizzled beard. His dress was of the antique Dutch fashion&#151;a cloth jerkin strapped around the waist&#151;several pair of breeches, the outer one of ample volume, decorated with rows of buttons down the sides, and bunches at the knees. He bore on his shoulders a stout keg, that seemed full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to approach and assist him with the load. Though rather shy and distrustful of this new acquaintance, Rip complied with his usual alacrity, and mutually relieving one another, they clambered up a narrow gully, apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent. As they ascended, Rip every now and then heard long rolling peals, like distant thunder, that seemed to issue out of a deep ravine, or rather cleft between lofty rocks, toward which their rugged path conducted. He paused for an instant, but supposing it to be the muttering of one of those transient thunder showers which often take place in mountain heights, he proceeded. Passing through the ravine, they came to a hollow, like a small amphitheater, surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the brinks of which impending trees shot their branches, so that you only caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud. During the whole time, Rip and his <!-- PAGE NUM="87" -->companion had labored on in silence; for though the former marveled greatly what could be the object of carrying a keg of liquor up this wild mountain, yet there was something strange and incomprehensible about the unknown that inspired awe and checked familiarity.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="20"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;20</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;On entering the amphitheater, new objects of wonder presented themselves. On a level spot in the center was a company of odd-looking personages playing at ninepins. They were dressed in a quaint, outlandish fashion: some wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long knives in their belts, and most had enormous breeches, of similar style with that of the guide&#146;s. Their visages, too, were peculiar: one had a large head, broad face, and small, piggish eyes; the face of another seemed to consist entirely of nose, and was surmounted by a white sugar-loaf hat set off with a little red cock&#146;s tail. They all had beards, of various shapes and colors. There was one who seemed to be the commander. He was a stout old gentleman, with a weather-beaten countenance; he wore a laced doublet, broad belt and hanger, high-crowned hat and feather, red stockings, and high-heeled shoes, with roses in them. The whole group reminded Rip of the figures in an old Flemish painting, in the parlor of Dominie Van Schaick, the village parson, and which had been brought over from Holland at the time of the settlement.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="21"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;21</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;What seemed particularly odd to Rip, was that though these folks were evidently amusing themselves, yet they maintained the gravest faces, the most mysterious silence, and were, withal, the most melancholy party of pleasure he had ever witnessed. Nothing interrupted the stillness of <!-- PAGE NUM="88" -->the scene but the noise of the balls, which, whenever they were rolled, echoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of thunder.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="22"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;22</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;As Rip and his companion approached them, they suddenly desisted from their play, and stared at him with such fixed statue-like gaze, and such strange, uncouth, lack-luster countenances, that his heart turned within him, and his knees smote together. His companion now emptied the contents of the keg into large flagons, and made signs to him to wait upon the company. He obeyed with fear and trembling; they quaffed the liquor in profound silence, and then returned to their game.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="23"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;23</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;By degrees, Rip&#146;s awe and apprehension subsided. He even ventured, when no eye was fixed upon him, to taste the beverage, which he found had much of the flavor of excellent Hollands. He was naturally a thirsty soul, and was soon tempted to repeat the draught. One taste provoked another, and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often, that at length his senses were overpowered, his eyes swam in his head, his head gradually declined, and he fell into a deep sleep.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="24"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;24</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;On awaking, he found himself on the green knoll from whence he had first seen the old man of the glen. He rubbed his eyes&#151;it was a bright sunny morning. The birds were hopping and twittering among the bushes, and the eagle was wheeling aloft and breasting the pure mountain breeze. &#147;Surely,&#148; thought Rip, &#147;I have not slept here all night.&#148; He recalled the occurrences before he fell asleep. The strange man with a keg of liquor&#151;the mountain ravine&#151;the wild retreat among the rocks&#151;the woe-begone party at ninepins&#151;the flagon&#151;<!-- PAGE NUM="89" -->&#147;Oh! that flagon! that wicked flagon!&#148; thought Rip&#151;&#147;what excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle?&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="25"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;25</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean, well-oiled fowling piece, he found an old firelock lying by him, the barrel incrusted with rust, the lock falling off, and the stock worm-eaten. He now suspected that the grave roysters of the mountain had put a trick upon him, and having dosed him with liquor, had robbed him of his gun. Wolf, too, had disappeared, but he might have strayed away after a squirrel or partridge. He whistled after him, shouted his name, but all in vain; the echoes repeated his whistle and shout, but no dog was to be seen.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="26"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;26</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;He determined to revisit the scene of the last evening&#146;s gambol, and if he met with any of the party, to demand his dog and gun. As he rose to walk, he found himself stiff in the joints, and wanting in his usual activity. &#147;These mountain beds do not agree with me,&#148; thought Rip, &#147;and if this frolic should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism, I shall have a blessed time with Dame Van Winkle.&#148; With some difficulty he got down into the glen; he found the gully up which he and his companion had ascended the preceding evening; but to his astonishment a mountain stream was now foaming down it, leaping from rock to rock, and filling the glen with babbling murmurs. He, however, made shift to scramble up its sides, working his toilsome way through thickets of birch, sassafras, and witch-hazel, and sometimes tripped up or entangled by the wild grape vines that twisted their coils and tendrils from tree to tree, and spread a kind of network in his path.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="27"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;27</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- PAGE NUM="90" -->At length he reached to where the ravine had opened through the cliffs to the amphitheater; but no traces of such opening remained. The rocks presented a high, impenetrable wall, over which the torrent came tumbling in a sheet of feathery foam, and fell into a broad, deep basin, black from the shadows of the surrounding forest. Here, then, poor Rip was brought to a stand. He again called and whistled after his dog; he was only answered by the cawing of a flock of idle crows, sporting high in air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny precipice; and who, secure in their elevation, seemed to look down and scoff at the poor man&#146;s perplexities. What was to be done? the morning was passing away, and Rip felt famished for want of his breakfast. He grieved to give up his dog and gun; he dreaded to meet his wife; but it would not do to starve among the mountains. He shook his head, shouldered the rusty firelock, and, with a heart full of trouble and anxiety, turned his steps homeward.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="28"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;28</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;As he approached the village, he met a number of people, but none whom he knew, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself acquainted with every one in the country round. Their dress, too, was of a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed. They all stared at him with equal marks of surprise, and whenever they cast their eyes upon him, invariably stroked their chins. The constant recurrence of this gesture induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the same, when, to his astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long!</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="29"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;29</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;He had now entered the skirts of the village. A troop of strange children ran at his heels, hooting after him, <!-- PAGE NUM="91" -->and pointing at his gray beard. The dogs, too, none of which he recognized for his old acquaintances, barked at him as he passed. The very village was altered: it was larger and more populous. There were rows of houses which he had never seen before, and those which had been his familiar haunts had disappeared. Strange names were over the doors&#151;strange faces at the windows&#151;everything was strange. His mind now began to misgive him; he doubted whether both he and the world around him were not bewitched. Surely this was his native village, which he had left but the day before. There stood the Catskill Mountains&#151;there ran the silver Hudson at a distance&#151;there was every hill and dale precisely as it had always been&#151;Rip was sorely perplexed&#151;&#147;That flagon last night,&#148; thought he, &#147;has addled my poor head sadly!&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="30"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;30</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with some difficulty he found the way to his own house, which he approached with silent awe, expecting every moment to hear the shrill voice of Dame Van Winkle. He found the house gone to decay&#151;the roof fallen in, the windows shattered, and the doors off the hinges. A half-starved dog, that looked like Wolf, was skulking about it. Rip called him by name, but the cur snarled, showed his teeth, and passed on. This was an unkind cut indeed&#151;&#147;My very dog,&#148; sighed poor Rip, &#147;has forgotten me!&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="31"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;31</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered the house, which, to tell the truth, Dame Van Winkle had always kept in neat order. It was empty, forlorn, and apparently abandoned. This desolateness overcame all his connubial fears&#151;he called loudly for his wife and children&#151;the lonely chambers <!-- PAGE NUM="92" -->rung for a moment with his voice, and then all again was silence.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="32"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;32</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;He now hurried forth, and hastened to his old resort, the little village inn&#151;but it too was gone. A large rickety wooden building stood in its place, with great gaping windows, some of them broken, and mended with old hats and petticoats, and over the door was painted, &#147;The Union Hotel, by Jonathan Doolittle.&#148; Instead of the great tree which used to shelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore, there now was reared a tall naked pole, with something on the top that looked like a red nightcap, and from it was fluttering a flag, on which was a singular assemblage of stars and stripes&#151;all this was strange and incomprehensible. He recognized on the sign, however, the ruby face of King George, under which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe, but even this was singularly metamorphosed. The red coat was changed for one of blue and buff, a sword was stuck in the hand instead of a scepter, the head was decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was painted in large characters, G<FONT SIZE="-1">ENERAL</FONT> W<FONT SIZE="-1">ASHINGTON.</FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="33"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;33</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, as usual, a crowd of folk about the door, but none whom Rip recollected. The very character of the people seemed changed. There was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it, instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquillity. He looked in vain for the sage Nicholas Vedder, with his broad face, double chin, and fair long pipe, uttering clouds of tobacco smoke instead of idle speeches; or Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, doling forth the contents of an ancient newspaper. In place of these, a lean, bilious-looking fellow, <!-- PAGE NUM="93" -->with his pockets full of handbills, was haranguing vehemently about rights of citizens&#151;election&#151;members of Congress&#151;liberty&#151;Bunker&#146;s Hill&#151;heroes of &#146;76&#151;and other words, that were a perfect Babylonish jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="34"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;34</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of Rip, with his long grizzled beard, his rusty fowling piece, his uncouth dress, and the army of women and children that had gathered at his heels, soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians. They crowded around him, eying him from head to foot, with great curiosity. The orator bustled up to him, and drawing him partly aside, inquired &#147;on which side he voted?&#148; Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short but busy little fellow pulled him by the arm, and raising on tiptoe, inquired in his ear, &#147;whether he was Federal or Democrat.&#148; Rip was equally at a loss to comprehend the question; when a knowing, self-important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way through the crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as he passed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo, the other resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating, as it were, into his very soul, demanded, in an austere tone, &#147;what brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his heels, and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village?&#148; &#147;Alas! gentlemen,&#148; cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, &#147;I am a poor quiet man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the king, God bless him!&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="35"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;35</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here a general shout burst from the bystanders&#151;&#147;A Tory! a Tory! a spy! a refugee! hustle him! away with <!-- PAGE NUM="94" -->him!&#148; It was with great difficulty that the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order; and having assumed a tenfold austerity of brow, demanded again of the unknown culprit, what he came there for, and whom he was seeking. The poor man humbly assured him that he meant no harm; but merely came there in search of some of his neighbors, who used to keep about the tavern.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="36"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;36</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Well&#151;who are they?&#151;name them.&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="37"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;37</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rip bethought himself a moment, and then inquired, &#147;Where&#146;s Nicholas Vedder?&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="38"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;38</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was silence for a little while, when an old man replied in a thin, piping voice, &#147;Nicholas Vedder? why, he is dead and gone these eighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used to tell all about him, but that&#146;s rotted and gone, too.&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="39"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;39</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Where&#146;s Brom Dutcher?&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="40"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;40</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the war; some say he was killed at the battle of Stony Point&#151;others say he was drowned in a squall, at the foot of Antony&#146;s Nose. I don&#146;t know&#151;he never came back again.&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="41"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;41</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Where&#146;s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="42"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;42</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;He went off to the wars, too, was a great militia general, and is now in Congress.&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="43"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;43</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rip&#146;s heart died away, at hearing of these sad changes in his home and friends, and finding himself thus alone in the world. Every answer puzzled him, too, by treating of such enormous lapses of time, and of matters which he could not understand: war&#151;Congress&#151;Stony Point!&#151;he had no courage to ask after any more friends, but <!-- PAGE NUM="95" -->cried out in despair, &#147;Does nobody here know Rip Van Winkle?&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="44"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;44</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Oh, Rip Van Winkle!&#148; exclaimed two or three, &#147;Oh, to be sure! that&#146;s Rip Van Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree.&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="45"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;45</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rip looked, and beheld a precise counterpart of himself, as he went up the mountain: apparently as lazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor fellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his own identity, and whether he was himself or another man. In the midst of his bewilderment, the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was, and what was his name?</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="46"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;46</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;God knows,&#148; exclaimed he, at his wit&#146;s end; &#147;I&#146;m not myself&#151;I&#146;m somebody else&#151;that&#146;s me yonder&#151;no&#151;that&#146;s somebody else, got into my shoes&#151;I was myself last night, but I fell asleep on the mountain, and they&#146;ve changed my gun, and everything&#146;s changed, and I&#146;m changed, and I can&#146;t tell what&#146;s my name, or who I am!&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="47"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;47</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The bystanders began now to look at each other, nod, wink significantly, and tap their fingers against their foreheads. There was a whisper, also, about securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from doing mischief; at the very suggestion of which, the self-important man in the cocked hat retired with some precipitation. At this critical moment a fresh, likely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man. She had a chubby child in her arms, which, frightened at his looks, began to cry. &#147;Hush, Rip,&#148; cried she, &#147;hush, you little fool, the old man won&#146;t hurt you.&#148; The name of the child, the air of the mother, the tone of her voice, <!-- PAGE NUM="96" -->all awakened a train of recollections in his mind. &#147;What is your name, my good woman?&#148; asked he.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="48"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;48</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Judith Gardenier.&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="49"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;49</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;And your father&#146;s name?&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="50"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;50</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Ah, poor man, his name was Rip Van Winkle; it&#146;s twenty years since he went away from home with his gun, and never has been heard of since&#151;his dog came home without him; but whether he shot himself, or was carried away by the Indians, nobody can tell. I was then but a little girl.&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="51"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;51</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rip had but one question more to ask; but he put it with a faltering voice:&#151;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="52"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;52</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Where&#146;s your mother?&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="53"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;53</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Oh, she too had died but a short time since; she broke a blood vessel in a fit of passion at a New England peddler.&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="54"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;54</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence. The honest man could contain himself no longer.&#151;He caught his daughter and her child in his arms.&#151;&#147;I am your father!&#148; cried he&#151;&#147;Young Rip Van Winkle once&#151;old Rip Van Winkle now!&#151;Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle!&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="55"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;55</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;All stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the crowd, put her hand to her brow, and peering under it in his face for a moment, exclaimed, &#147;Sure enough! it is Rip Van Winkle&#151;it is himself. Welcome home again, old neighbor.&#151;Why, where have you been these twenty long years?&#148;</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="56"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;56</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rip&#146;s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him but as one night. The neighbors stared when they heard it; some where seen to wink at <!-- PAGE NUM="97" -->each other, and put their tongues in their cheeks; and the self-important man in the cocked hat, who, when the alarm was over, had returned to the field, screwed down the corners of his mouth, and shook his head&#151;upon which there was a general shaking of the head throughout the assemblage.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="57"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;57</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was determined, however, to take the opinion of old Peter Vanderdonk, who was seen slowly advancing up the road. He was a descendant of the historian of that name, who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the province. Peter was the most ancient inhabitant of the village, and well versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of the neighborhood. He recollected Rip at once, and corroborated his story in the most satisfactory manner. He assured the company that it was a fact, handed down from his ancestor the historian, that the Catskill Mountains had always been haunted by strange beings. That it was affirmed that the great Hendrick Hudson, the first discoverer of the river and country, kept a kind of vigil there every twenty years, with his crew of the <I>Half-Moon,</I> being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of his enterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon the river, and the great city called by his name. That his father had once seen them in their old Dutch dresses playing at ninepins in a hollow of the mountain; and that he himself had heard, one summer afternoon, the sound of their balls, like long peals of thunder.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="58"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;58</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a long story short, the company broke up, and returned to the more important concerns of the election. Rip&#146;s daughter took him home to live with her; she had a snug, well-furnished house, and a stout cheery farmer <!-- PAGE NUM="98" -->for a husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that used to climb upon his back. As to Rip&#146;s son and heir, who was the ditto of himself, seen leaning against the tree, he was employed to work on the farm; but evinced an hereditary disposition to attend to anything else but his business.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="59"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;59</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rip now resumed his old walks and habits; he soon found many of his former cronies, though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of time; and preferred making friends among the rising generation, with whom he soon grew into great favor.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="60"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;60</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;Having nothing to do at home, and being arrived at that happy age when a man can do nothing with impunity, he took his place once more on the bench, at the inn door, and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the village, and a chronicle of the old times &#147;before the war.&#148; It was some time before he could get into the regular track of gossip, or could be made to comprehend the strange events that had taken place during his torpor. How that there had been a revolutionary war&#151;that the country had thrown off the yoke of old England&#151;and that, instead of being a subject of his Majesty, George III., he was now a free citizen of the United States. Rip, in fact, was no politician; the changes of states and empires made but little impression on him; but there was one species of despotism under which he had long groaned, and that was&#151;petticoat government; happily, that was at an end; he had got his neck out of the yoke of matrimony, and could go in and out whenever he pleased, without dreading the tyranny of Dame Van Winkle. Whenever her name was mentioned, however, he shook his head, <!-- PAGE NUM="99" -->shrugged his shoulders, and cast up his eyes; which might pass either for an expression of resignation to his fate, or joy at his deliverance.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="61"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;61</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to tell his story to every stranger that arrived at Dr. Doolittle&#146;s hotel. He was observed, at first, to vary on some points every time he told it, which was, doubtless, owing to his having so recently awaked. It at last settled down precisely to the tale I have related, and not a man, woman, or child in the neighborhood but knew it by heart. Some always pretended to doubt the reality of it, and insisted that Rip had been out of his head, and this was one point on which he always remained flighty. The old Dutch inhabitants, however, almost universally gave it full credit. Even to this day they never hear a thunder-storm of a summer afternoon, about the Catskills, but they say Hendrick Hudson and his crew are at their game of ninepins; and it is a common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighborhood, when life hangs heavy on their hands, that they might have a quieting draught out of Rip Van Winkle&#146;s flagon.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="62"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;62</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;N<FONT SIZE="-1">OTE.</FONT>&#151;The foregoing tale, one would suspect, had been suggested to Mr. Knickerbocker by a little German superstition about the Emperor Frederick and the Kypphauser Mountain; the subjoined note, however, which he had appended to the tale, shows that it is an absolute fact, narrated with his usual fidelity.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="63"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;63</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;The story of Rip Van Winkle may seem incredible to many, but nevertheless I give it my full belief, for I know the vicinity of our old Dutch settlements to have been very subject to marvelous events and appearances. Indeed, I have heard many stranger stories than this, in the villages along the <!-- PAGE NUM="100" -->Hudson; all of which were too well authenticated to admit of a doubt. I have even talked with Rip Van Winkle myself, who, when last I saw him, was a very venerable old man, and so perfectly rational and consistent on every other point, that I think no conscientious person could refuse to take this into the bargain; nay, I have seen a certificate on the subject taken before a country justice and signed with a cross, in the justice&#146;s own handwriting. The story, therefore, is beyond the possibility of a doubt.

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kaatsberg, or Catskill Mountains, have always been a region full of fable. The Indians considered them the abode of spirits, who influenced the weather, spreading sunshine or clouds over the landscape, and sending good or bad hunting seasons. They were ruled by an old squaw spirit, said to be their mother. She dwelt on the highest peak of the Catskills, and had charge of the doors of day and night to open and shut them at the proper hour. She hung up the new moon in the skies, and cut up the old ones into stars. In times of drought, if properly propitiated, she would spin light summer clouds out of cobwebs and morning dew, and send them off from the crest of the mountain, flake after flake, like flakes of carded cotton, to float in the air; until, dissolved by the heat of the sun, they would fall in gentle showers, causing the grass to spring, the fruits to ripen, and the corn to grow an inch an hour. If displeased, however, she would brew up clouds black as ink, sitting in the midst of them like a bottle-bellied spider in the midst of its web; and when these clouds broke, woe betide the valleys!</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="66"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;66</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;In old times, say the Indian traditions, there was a kind of <!-- PAGE NUM="101" -->Manitou or Spirit, who kept about the wildest recesses of the Catskill Mountains, and took a mischievous pleasure in wreaking all kinds of evils and vexations upon the red men. Sometimes he would assume the form of a bear, a panther, or a deer, lead the bewildered hunter a weary chase through tangled forests and among ragged rocks; and then spring off with a loud ho! ho! leaving him aghast on the brink of a beetling precipice or raging torrent.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="67"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;67</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;The favorite abode of this Manitou is still shown. It is a great rock or cliff on the loneliest part of the mountains, and, from the flowering vines which clamber about it, and the wild flowers which abound in its neighborhood, is known by the name of the Garden Rock. Near the foot of it is a small lake, the haunt of the solitary bittern, with water snakes basking in the sun on the leaves of the pond lilies which lie on the surface. This place was held in great awe by the Indians, insomuch that the boldest hunter would not pursue his game within its precincts. Once upon a time, however, a hunter who had lost his way, penetrated to the Garden Rock, where he beheld a number of gourds placed in the crotches of trees. One of these he seized, and made off with it, but in the hurry of his retreat he let it fall among the rocks, when a great stream gushed forth, which washed him away and swept him down precipices, where he was dashed to pieces, and the stream made its way to the Hudson, and continues to flow to the present day; being the identical stream known by the name of Kaaterskill.</TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE="-2"><A NAME="68"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;68</I></A></FONT></TD></TR>
