                                          In a large percentage of cases, we save our customers the cost of the controller, <em>or more</em>. This is because our custom SPLat can contain functions 
                                          that would be very expensive, if not impossible, to buy as a separate add-on for off the shelf <a class="tt" onmouseover="TagToTip('custom_cost_saving_1')" onmouseout="UnTip()">PLC or single board computer <img src="/images/query_icon.gif" width="12" height="12" border="0" alt="query"></a>.

                                          That&#39;s one point. The other point is this: The NRE on a custom SPLat is much less than you would be charged by a design house who start every design with a 
                                          blank screen and <em>who make their income out of design work alone.</em> Our controller designs are based on a library of recipes, so we can slash the 
                                          design time, the design cost and the risk factor.

																					To most people &quot;custom&quot; equates to &quot;expensive&quot;. But a custom SPLat controller 
																					could easily be the lowest cost option for your product. Of course, it&#39;s all about quantities, but the quantity threshold where
																					a custom SPLat controller is worthwhile is quite low, generally 200-500 per year (even lower in some special circumstances).
																					There are 3 main reasons why this is so:

                                       SPLat gives you the ability to make your product smarter and more competitive, at the same time delivering 
																			 significant savings. Our rapid prototyping products 
                                       provide exceptional value for prototyping and small to medium quantity production, 
																			 while we have a range of choices that make a custom or semi-custom control

                                       work with our customers to build a partnering relationship. It is not uncommon for us not 
																			 only to support our customers in questions of their control system, 
                                       but also to make contributions to the overall design of their product. </td>

                                       SPLat sports an integral multitasking operating system called MultiTrack. MultiTrack is so easy to use that you can have a program up and running, doing

                                       Our Fast-track programming lets you write useful control programs using only a dozen instruction types. Our rapid prototyping products come ready to wire in, 
                                       with real-world interface circuits already provided for you. We provide free training courses and tutorials that assume no prior knowledge of programming, yet 
                                       teach you techniques normally associated with university level tuition. Our much praised documentation uses simple language and explains a lot. <br>

                                       very affordable paths to a custom control solution. A full custom SPLat can be economical in quantities down to 200 per year. What&#39;s more, we have 
                                       semi-customization options that can work for you down to <em>a single batch of 15 units.</em> <br>

                                       We have designed countless custom controls since our company was founded in 1981, and the company experience goes even further back, to the dawn of the 
                                       microprocessor era. We therefore have the steps and processes involved in successfully managing a custom development well and truly nailed - we know what we 
                                       are doing! What&#39;s more, custom SPLat designs are all based on the same underlying technology, eliminating the risks of &quot;blank sheet&quot; custom designs. For you 
                                       this means your project will be well managed, cost a lot less, take less time and give a sure-fire outcome. </td>

                                       An electronic controller is a device (typically a printed circuit board assembly) that includes a number of &quot;inputs&quot; and a number of &quot;outputs&quot;. The inputs 
                                       connect to external sensor devices like switches, object detectors, or temperature sensors. The outputs drive actuators, such as solenoid valves, motors, or 
                                       lamps.
                                       <br>
                                       &nbsp;<br>
                                       The inputs <em>to</em> a controller provide information about what is happening in its world (which might be your dishwasher). The outputs <em>from</em> the 
                                       controller allow it to control events in its world, such as open a water valve, turn on a heater, run a motor. <br>
                                       &nbsp;<br>
                                       <strong>SPLat</strong> is a <em>programmable </em>controller. The relationship between the inputs (information) and outputs (outcomes) is controlled by a <em>
                                       program</em>. The program is a specialized computer program. In fact, a SPLat is like a small computer that has been optimized for control applications. The
                                       <em>program</em> determines what the controller does. The biggest advantage of a programmable controller 
                                       over a fixed function controller is that the same hardware design (the SPLat printed circuit assembly), can be used for a huge range of applications, with 
                                       resulting economies of scale. </td>

   <p>VM = Virtual Machine. This is a technology that lets us create a virtual 
   processor as a program running in a real processor. The virtual processor 
   is optimized for controller applications. Because of that it is very much 
   easier (cheaper) to write control programs than if we were programming in 
   a general purpose language. The end result is faster results that are more 
   reliable and cost you less. In effect we have done much of the hard work

   <p>SPLat is a controller product, maybe the only controller product, that has 
   been developed specifically with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)

   (be it 5 at a time or 5,000 at a time) that needs an electronic control

   <p>One of our customers&#39; most frequent comments is &quot;Gee, your boards
   are so reliable!&quot;. We always feel a little surprised, because we 
   don&#39;t actually know how to make bad boards. If one of our boards fails 
   (it can happen), we always analyze the failure to find out if there
   is anything we can do to avoid future failures. Sometimes than means 
   tightening up a test or inspection procedure, sometime it means
   stomping on a component supplier. But we always take it to heart. 
   We make a good solid product, and that&#39;s a matter of pride for us.</p>

   units you use a convenient off the shelf control solution, maybe a regular PLC or PC104 boards. Then, 
   when it&#39;s time to move into production you decide the initial control is going to cost far too 
   much in volume production. So now you have to get a custom control made <em>and</em> you will 
   have to pay to have it programmed <em>from the ground up. </em></p>
   <p>
   With SPLat that won&#39;t happen. Say you use our rapid prototyping products for your prototypes.
   They are quick and easy to program (do it yourself or have us do it for you). Then, when you
   get into production and require a custom SPLat, the prototype program will work with a few
   minor adjustments. The bulk of your programming investment is preserved.</p></div>
<div id="time_to_market">
   <p>SPLat assists with time to market in several ways:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Rapid Prototyping products are available for instant shipment</li>
      <li>All our Rapid Prototyping products incorporate <em>real world</em> I/O interfaces,
      so you don&#39;t have grab a soldering iron and start designing extra interface circuits</li>
      <li>If our Rapid Prototyping products do not offer some special hardware function, 
      we have ways of making a &quot;special&quot; for you relatively inexpensively</li>
      <li>Our programming language is optimized for controller applications, unlike for 
      example C, so it is easy to learn and produces results very quickly.</li>
      <li>When we make a custom controller design for you, the turnaround time is typically 
      only 15 weeks including two rounds of prototypes.</li>
      <li>Because our custom designs are based on reusable design elements, the 
      confidence-of-success factor is practically 100%.</li>
   </ul></div>
<div id="bare_board">
   <p>Our controls are generally supplied as bare printed circuit boards, intended 
   for &quot;tight integration&quot; into a your product. If you are using one of our off the shelf rapid 
   prototyping products, we have some innovative ideas to help you make 
   it blend seamlessly into the look and feel of your own product.
	 If you have a custom SPLat made 
   (which is surprisingly economical for a few hundred), the form factor and feature set will be 
   tailored to your exact needs.</p></div>
<div id="generic_hvac">
   <p>The controller illustrated is a generic HVAC controller we made as a demonstration 
   of some of the possibilities in that field. So while it may look rather boring, 
   it can get HVAC makers quite excited. It illustrates very well some of the seemingly 
   simple measures that can add huge value and yet are inaccessible to users 
   who stick to conventional off the shelf products. Specific features of this board include:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Hardwired safety interlocks (HP/LP)</li>
      <li>24VAC power (common in HVAC industry)</li>
      <li>7-segment readout and buttons for diagnostic information (&quot;Why did it trip out?&quot;)</li>
      <li>Quick connect terminals for factory wiring - fast and efficient in a manufacturing 
      situation</li>
      <li>Barrier terminal strip for field wiring</li>
      <li>Industry-familiar markings on terminals</li>
      <li>3 thermistor inputs</li>
      <li>Accepts off the shelf SPLat I/O expansion boards</li>
      <li>Relays simply switch 24VAC to the outputs. One connection per output minimizes 
      external wiring</li>
      <li>Connection for an optional off-board operator interface</li>
   </ul></div>
<div id="wtek">

   <p>This is an example of a custom 
controller
	  with a break even for the NRE investment of fewer than 50 units. 
   It is a controller for a solar powered trash compactor. The motor that drives the compactor is available only 
   in 24VDC (not 12V). That meant our customer was faced with having to use a 24V solar panel which would cost 
   twice as much as necessary. What we did instead was integrate a peak power tracking 12V solar charger with a 
   12V to 24V DC step up inverter <em>directly onto the controller board</em>. The voltage boost means a 12V 
   solar panel can be used. The peak power tracking means a lower wattage panel can be used, as the power 
   extraction is highly efficient. The board is also used in mains powered machines.</p>

   <p>The controller also contains:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Reversible, DC motor drive with dynamic braking</li>
      <li>2 on-board reflective position sensors (A further ~$50 saving!)</li>
      <li>DIP switches for configuration settings</li>
      <li>An expansion connector to allow use of off the shelf SPLat I/O expanders for &quot;specials&quot;</li>
   </ul>
   <p>This kind of high level functional integration can only be acheived with a control that is custom designed for 
   the application. Our unique design approach makes this kind of customization accessible even in relatively 
   small quantities.</p></div>
<div id="impossible_functions">
   <p>One of our customers, a system integrator, had been making a particular control panel for his 
   customer for many years, using a regular PLC. Then his end-customer 
   switched to a new model of core mechanism in his product. That mechanism 
   came with a proprietary sensor and a controller that was a huge over-kill 
   but could accept the special sensor. Our customer was at risk of losing 
   the business, because he had no way of interfacing the sensor to a regular 
   PLC.</p>
   <p>He approached us for a solution. We obtained a sample of the sensor and in 
   2-3 hours analyzed its proprietary communications protocol. Subsequently we
   designed a custom SPLat controller, including the special sensor interface</p>
   <p>
   We saved our customer&#39;s business.</p></div>
<div id="custom_cost_saving_2">
   <p>A custom SPLat will save you money in many ways:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>A perfect mechanical fit integrates easily into your product design</li>
      <li>Designed for easy wiring to save product assembly time</li>
      <li>Onboard functions that might otherwise have to be purchased as 
      separate modules and separately mounted and wired</li>
      <li>We frequently provide built in production line test features and 
      matching PC programs to assist your final product testing</li>
      <li>Low NRE compared to other custom solutions</li>
   </ul>
</div>
<div id="custom_cost_saving_1">
   <p>For example, one of our customers was paying $60 each for 3 holding 
   current limiters for high power solenoids. We integrated them into 
   his custom SPLat controller at a cost (to him) of about $10 <em><strong>total</strong></em>. 
   That saved him $170 per controller. His NRE cost was more than 
   amortised over the first batch of 50 controllers (not even counting 
   the labour saving of not mounting and wiring 150 current limiters!)</p>

   <p>One custom controller we made for Carrier air conditioning actually 
   saves its total cost just in reduced final assembly and testing time, 
   with a bonus of a significant reduction in warranty call-outs.</p>
</div>
<div id="custom_cost_saving_1a">
   <p>When we design a custom SPLat controller we are really just integrating a bunch of
	 pre-designed circuit elements. The process is fast, giving you a quick time to market. The amount of labor
	 required is low, and so we can keep the Non Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs to you low.
	 This results in an NRE that is easily amortised out of the saving on production units.</p>
	 <p>As an additional benefit, the risk factor is very low because we are working in familiar territory. We never have failed designs.</p>
</div>
<div id="custom_cost_saving_1b">
   <p>For example, one of our customers was paying $60 each for 3 holding 
   current limiters for high power solenoids. We integrated them into 
   his custom SPLat controller at a cost (to him) of about $10 <em><strong>total</strong></em>. 
   That saved him $170 per controller, a significant proportion of the controller cost!
	 (Not to mention the labour saving from not having to mount and wire 3 extra devices per control system)</p>
</div>
<div id="custom_cost_saving_1c">

</div>


<div id="ip_protection">
   <p>A custom SPLat strengthens your Intellectual Property (IP) because:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>A custom control, with your brand name on it, enhances the 
      perception of your product being &quot;special&quot;</li>
      <li>It is impossible to read the program out of a SPLat, making 
      your product harder to copy</li>
      <li>SPLat makes it relatively easy to add &quot;smarts&quot; to 
      your product, increasing its IP value</li>
   </ul>
</div>
<div id="programming_in_your_control">
   <p>SPLat is easy to program compared to say C or ladder logic based control 
   systems. Even if you have no previous programming experience you can 
   learn to program SPLat. If you chose you can do your own programming. 
   You may also chose to have us do your initial programming for you. Either 
   way, you wind up owning your application program (which we call SPLatWare). 
   You will never be hostage to an outside design house with a set of arcane, 
   hard to learn skills.</p></div>
<div id="time_to_market_2">
   <p>A custom SPLat has a faster time to market than other custom solutions 
   because we never start a design with a blank CAD screen. Designing a custom 
   SPLat is a mature process which we have been through untold times before. 
   We have standard reusable hardware design elements. The core firmware is 
   tried and proven, and is easily adapted to variant hardware configurations. 
   We often spend more time communicating with you to accurately 
   establish your needs than we spend designing the resulting circuit.</p></div>
<div id="know_about">
   <p>We sell controllers to a great number of customer. Naturally our customers 
   don&#39;t all tell us what they are using the controllers for. The examples below 
   are all real, and only some of those we do know of.</p></div>
<div id="onboard_oi">
   <p>We pioneered the concept of building a controller with an integral user interface 
   with our MMi88 in 1997. We also, simultaneously, devised the idea of a membrane 
   overlay that the user could easily customize by placing paper labels behind clear 
   windows in the overlay.</p></div>
<div id="whats_analog">
   <p>Most inputs and outputs on machine controllers are <em>digital</em>, i.e. either ON 
   or OFF, like a light switch, with nothing in between. Sometimes you may need many 
   steps between all or nothing, like in a light dimmer. That is called analog. Analog 
   inputs are used to quantities things like temperature or weight. Analog outputs are used 
   to control things smoothly, like the speed of a motor.</p></div>
<div id="whats_spice">
   <p>SPice is another of our simple but powerful original concepts. Most SPLat controllers, 
   be they custom or rapid prototyping, have a SPice connector. Onto the SPice connector 
   you can plug a small daughter board (SPice board) which provides some special 
   purpose functionality. Examples are water level switching or AC current measurement. </p>

   <p>SPice is a simple way of providing some added functionality inexpensively. What&#39;s 
   more, it is relatively easy for us (hence inexpensive for you) to make a up a batch 
   of 15 to 20 custom SPice boards as a one-off exercise. That means you can now access 
   a custom function for your product at a fraction of what it used to cost to have a 
   &quot;special&quot; made.</p></div>
<div id="whats_xwire">
   <p>Xwire is our proprietary system for interconnecting a number of SPLat 
   controllers and/or peripheral boards. It has been designed to be 
   very inexpensive to implement in hardware (cents) and very simple 
   to program.</p></div>
<div id="hio_brief">
   <p>Illustrated: HIO16 expansion board. Eight relays, each rated 20A motor 
   load (80A inrush) and eight optically isolated digital inputs capable 
   of accepting AC or DC from 24V to 240V. <strong>Real grunt!</strong></p></div>
<div id="hmxc_brief">
   <p>This custom environmental controller represents something that was 
   close to impossible for our customer before they came to us. It runs 
   off 24VAC (<em>most</em> unusual). It has an onboard temperature and 
   humidity sensor (to buy an RH/T transmitter alone would cost more than 
   this whole controller). It has the exact relays needed to drive an 
   external contactor and a solenoid valve. It has a DIP switch for 
   installation settings. External wiring is via push-in terminals to 
   save time. The board is conformally coated. It costs an estimated 68% 
   <em>less</em> than the same functionality using off the shelf PLC products. 
   The NRE was amortised over 62 production units, based on these savings.</p>

   <p>This all started when we were approached with the question &quot;could we 
   interface a so-and-so brand sensor to our controllers?&quot; 3 days later 
   we had sourced a sample sensor, wired it up to one of our Rapid 
   Prototype controllers, written a driver and shipped it out of our 
   Boston office to the customer. So a week from making the inquiry the 
   customer had a proof of concept controller working.</p></div>
<div id="sx10214_brief">
   <p>It&#39;s not world shattering rocket science. It simply interfaces some 
   potentiometers to a SPLat controller. Surprisingly, such a simple, basic 
   function is hardly catered for by any of our competitors. More 
   importantly, not being able to do something like this could be a 
   show-stopper for your project.</p></div>
<div id="sx10204_brief">
   <p>Simple AC current measurement is fundamental to many applications 
   involving motors and other high powered AC loads. This SPLat add-on 
   board endows a SPLat controller with a 5A current transformer and 
   converts it to a regular analog input.</p></div>
<div id="your_spice_brief">
   <p>To you it may seem like in insurmountable problem. To us it might 
   be just another day at the office. Designing and building electronic 
   circuits is what we do. That capability is available to our customers 
   to help solve their problems. Sure, there&#39;s a price, but it may not 
   be anywhere near as high as you might think. Some challenges are drop- 
   dead easy, so you may only have to pay for a few hours of effort. Others 
   may be harder. It point is, we are always willing to listen. All you 
   have to do is ask!</p></div>
<div id="category_map">
   <p>This map gives a general idea of where SPLat fits into the electronic controls space.</p>
   <h3>Traditional industrial PLCs</h3>
   <p>These are designed and optimized for factory automation. Hardware cost is secondary to total implementation cost. Good PLCs are built like
   a brick outhouse, and typically cost like a marble palace.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Upside: Solid and reliable.</li>
      <li>Downside: Expensive, bulky. Special functionality is very expensive.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Single board computers</h3>
   <p>Board level products. Usually huge computing power and memory, but pathetic real-
   world I/O like relay drivers or industrial sensor inputs. Usually programmed in C and require a Real Time
   Operating System (RTOS). Sub-category: &quot;stamp&quot; products designed for hobbyists.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Upside: Standardized form factors &amp; multiple vendors, e.g. PC104.</li>
      <li>Downside: Poor I/O. Not designed for physical integration into a product.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Full custom controllers</h3>
   <p>You get a design house to design a dedicated controller from the ground up. A good choice if 
   you&#39;re making many thousand per year, providing you can find a good designer and you are prepared 
   to take a high risk on things going badly wrong (many of our customers are refugees from such situations).</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Upside: Lowest possible cost in large volume.</li>
      <li>Downside: Very high NRE, risk factors. </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>... and SPLat?</h3>
   <p>SPLat fits in the neglected middle ground. Ideal for equipment makers
   who make up to 5,000 units per year and need friendly, competent service and support. These people, maybe
   like you (?) know their own product but are not control system experts. Their products are frequently highly
   innovative and need innovative control solutions.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Upside: Economy, service, support, innovation. </li>
      <li>Downside: Creates a grossly unfair competitive advantage for our customers.</li>
   </ul>
