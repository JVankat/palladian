        it delivered to the custody of the department if the property is an alcoholic 

        product or a package used as a container for an alcoholic product, or 

        to the Department of Administrative Services in all other cases. The appropriate

        to forfeiture, it shall order release of the property to the proper claimant. 

        If the court determines that the property is subject to forfeiture and 

        release in part, it shall order partial release and partial forfeiture. 

        When the property cannot be properly divided for partial forfeiture and 

        release, the court shall order it sold and the proceeds distributed as 

        follows:</strike> <br>

        (iii) third, to the state treasurer for the General Fund.</strike> <br>

        <strike><br>

        (k) In any proceeding under this section where forfeiture is declared, 

        in whole or in part, the court shall assess all costs of the forfeiture 

        proceeding, including seizure and storage of the property, against the 

        individual or individuals whose conduct was the basis of the forfeiture, 

        and may assess costs against any other claimant or claimants to the property 

        as the court considers equitable.</strike> <br>

        <strike><br>

        (e) When property is seized under this chapter, any interested person 

        or claimant of the property, prior to being served with a complaint under 

        this section, may file a petition in the court having jurisdiction for 

        release of his interest in the property. The petition shall specify the 

        claimant's interest in the property and his right to have it released. 

        A copy shall be served upon the county attorney in the county of the seizure, 

        who shall answer the petition within 20 days. A petitioner need not answer 

        a complaint of forfeiture.</strike> <br>

        <strike><br>

        (f) After 20 days following service of a complaint or petition for release, 

        the court shall examine the record and if no answer is on file, the court 

        shall allow the complainant or petitioner an opportunity to present evidence 

        in support of his claim and order forfeiture or release of the property 

        as the court determines. If the county attorney has not filed an answer 

        to a petition for release and the court determines from the evidence that 

        the petitioner is not entitled to recovery of the property, it shall enter 

        an order directing the county attorney to answer the petition within ten 

        days. If no answer is filed within that period, the court shall order 

        the release of the property to the petitioner entitled to receive it.</strike> 

        <br>

        <strike><br>

        (g) When an answer to a complaint or petition appears of record at the 

        end of 20 days, the court shall set the matter for hearing within 20 days. 

        At this hearing, all interested parties may present evidence of their 

        rights of release of the property following the state's evidence for forfeiture. 

        The court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence the issues 

        in the case and order forfeiture or release of the property as it determines.</strike> 

        <br>

        <strike><br>

        (h) Proceedings of this section are independent of any other proceedings, 

        whether civil or criminal, under this chapter or the laws of this state.</strike>

        <strike><br>

        (i) When the court determines that claimants have no right in the property 

        in whole or in part, it shall declare the property to be forfeited and 

        direct it to be delivered to the custody of the Division of Finance. The 

        division shall dispose of the property under Subsection&nbsp;<br>

        (5).</strike> <br>

        <br>

        <strike>(j) When the court determines that property, in whole or in part, 

        is not subject to forfeiture, it shall order release of the property to 

        the proper claimant. If the court determines that the property is subject 

        to forfeiture and release in part, it shall order partial release and 

        partial forfeiture. When the property cannot be divided for partial forfeiture 

        and release, the court shall order it sold and the proceeds distributed:</strike> 

        <br>

        <strike><br>

        (i) first, proportionally among the legitimate claimants;</strike> <br>

        <strike><br>

        costs of sale; and</strike> <br>

        <strike><br>

        (iii) third, to the Division of Finance for the General Fund.</strike> 

        <br>

        <strike><br>

        (k) In a proceeding under this section where forfeiture is declared, in 

        whole or in part, the court shall assess all costs of the forfeiture proceeding, 

        including seizure and storage of the property, against the individual 

        or individuals whose conduct was the basis of the forfeiture, and may 

        assess costs against any other claimant or claimants to the property as 

        appropriate.</strike>]</font> <font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>

        is of record in the Division of Motor Vehicles, by mailing a copy of the

        of the division, which service is considered complete even though the

        (e) When property is seized under this section, any interested person 

        or claimant of the property, prior to being served with a complaint under 

        this section, may file a petition in the court having jurisdiction for 

        release of his interest in the property. The petition shall specify the 

        claimant's interest in the property and his right to have it released. 

        A copy shall be served upon the county attorney in the county of the seizure, 

        who shall answer the petition within 20 days. A petitioner need not answer 

        a complaint of forfeiture.</strike> <br>

        <strike><br>

        (f) After 20 days following service of a complaint or petition for release, 

        the court shall examine the record and if no answer is on file, the court 

        shall allow the complainant or petitioner an</strike> <strike>opportunity 

        to present evidence in support of his claim and order forfeiture or release 

        of the property as the court determines. If a prosecuting agency has not 

        filed an answer to a petition for release and the court determines from 

        the evidence that the petitioner is not entitled to recovery of the property, 

        it shall enter an order directing the prosecuting agency to answer the 

        petition within ten days. If no answer is filed within that period, the 

        court shall order the release of the property to the petitioner entitled 

        to receive it.</strike></font> <font face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>

        end of 20 days, the court shall set the matter for hearing within 20 days. 

        At this hearing all interested parties may present evidence of their rights 

        of release of the property following the state's evidence for forfeiture. 

        The court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence the issues 

        in the case and order forfeiture or release of the property as it determines.</strike>

        in whole or in part, it shall declare the property to be forfeited and 

        direct it to be delivered as provided in Subsection (6).</strike> <br>

        (i) When the court determines that property, in whole or in part, is not 

        subject to forfeiture, it shall order release of the property to the proper 

        claimant. If the court determines that the property is subject to forfeiture 

        and release in part, it shall order partial release and partial forfeiture. 

        When the property cannot be divided for partial forfeiture and release, 

        the court shall order it sold and the proceeds distributed:</strike> <br>

        of the property, legal costs of filing and pursuing the forfeiture, and

        the seizing agency upon a petition by the seizing agency of the property 

        in the complaint filed under Subsection (5)(a) and a finding by the court 

        that the seizing agency isable to use the forfeited property in the enforcement 

        of offenses under Title 58 and Title 76, Chapter 10.</strike> <br>
