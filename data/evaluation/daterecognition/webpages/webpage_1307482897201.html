			Cotton Subsidies</font></b> </p>
			<p>By ELIZABETH BECKER </p>
			<p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 - An international court case in Geneva could 
			force a resolution of the global battle over agricultural subsidies, 
			which has pitted rich nations against poorer ones for decades. </p>
			<p>The case comes as anger in the Third World over the $300 billion 
			in annual farm subsidies provided by the United States, European 
			countries and other wealthy nations has blocked progress on regional 
			and global trade negotiations over the last year. </p>
			<p>Brazil now has the first case challenging these subsidies before 
			the World Trade Organization, accusing the United States of breaking 
			trade rules by giving American cotton growers and agribusinesses 
			$1.54 billion in annual subsidies. </p>
			<p>American cotton growers - the world's largest cotton exporters - 
			say the case threatens their livelihood and the entire American farm 
			subsidy system. The Brazilians say that the overproduction caused by 
			American subsidies is destroying their export markets and 
			undermining the livelihoods of their farmers. </p>
			<p><b><font color="#FF0000">To the consternation of the 
			administration and the American cotton industry, Brazil has relied 
			almost exclusively on data from the United States Agriculture 
			Department and American agricultural experts to make its case.</font></b>
			</p>
			<p>This week, in a sign that the United States has grown weary of 
			Brazil's tactics, the administration refused to turn over documents 
			that could bolster its own defense, saying the information would 
			compromise the identity of farmers who receive the money. </p>
			<p>Experts on the relatively new W.T.O. dispute settlement system 
			said that refusing to give the information could look suspicious to 
			the three members of the panel hearing the case and bolster the 
			chances of a ruling against the United States. But with so little 
			precedent in this eight-year-old global legal arena, experts are 
			watching the case carefully, anxious about the precedents it will 
			set. </p>
			<p>&quot;This is a groundbreaking case - a whole new area - and a tough 
			case for the United States,&quot; said Claude E. Barfield, director of 
			trade studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a trade 
			adviser during the Reagan administration. &quot;Even though I am very 
			much opposed to the existing farm subsidies of the United States and 
			Europe, I worry about the potential here for a substantial backlash. 
			This is a highly political and volatile issue.&quot; </p>
			<p>A decision in the case is expected in early spring. </p>
			<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>In closed hearings, Brazil has 
			aggressively asserted that the United States has broken trade rules 
			by using cotton subsidies to grab a larger share of the export 
			market and pushing down world cotton prices, according to documents 
			submitted by both countries.</b></font> </p>
			<p>In moving its battle to the courtroom, Brazil knew that it was 
			raising the stakes. Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade 
			representative, sent letters this month to more than 100 trade 
			ministers saying he wanted to revive global trade talks that would 
			require progress on these agriculture issues. But a ruling in this 
			case could upset those talks. </p>
			<p>&quot;You have to understand we are fed up with these farm subsidies 
			and hearing for 25 years that things will get better,&quot; said Aluisio 
			G. de Lima-Campos, an economic adviser at the Brazilian Embassy in 
			Washington. &quot;The only way to deal with it is to turn this into a 
			make-it-or-break-it proposition.&quot; </p>
			<p>Brazil, along with China, India, South Africa and a dozen other 
			developing nations, altered the global trading balance last year 
			when they banded together at trade talks in Cancï¿½n, Mexico, as a 
			bloc determined to reduce rich-nation farm subsidies. They argued 
			that the subsidies not only hurt their exports but also ruined the 
			livelihoods of their poorer peasants and farmers, creating huge 
			social and political problems in addition to the economic ones. </p>
			<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The United States has defended its 
			cotton subsidies, which have helped make it the world's top cotton 
			exporter with more than 40 percent of the world market. Officials 
			argued that Brazilian cotton consistently undercut the price of 
			United States cotton in export markets and that even without the 
			subsidies, American farmers would grow the same amount of cotton and 
			that world prices would be unaffected. </font></b></p>
			<p>Administration lawyers also said in their submissions that they 
			had kept subsidies at levels determined in earlier agreements and 
			were thereby protected by a &quot;peace clause&quot; that prohibits challenges 
			of the fairness of farm subsidies at the W.T.O. </p>
			<p>&quot;Our cotton program complies with our W.T.O. obligations,&quot; said 
			Richard Mills, the spokesman for the trade representative. </p>
			<p>The United States cotton industry is more fearful and describes 
			the case as the &quot;center of the storm&quot; threatening its livelihood and 
			the entire American farm subsidy system. </p>
			<p>&quot;If this panel finds against the United States, it may force 
			radical revisions in U.S. commodity programs,&quot; said William A. 
			Gillon, legal counsel to the National Cotton Council, a trade group.
			</p>
			<p>Mr. Gillon and the administration were especially critical of the 
			work of Daniel A. Sumner, professor of agricultural economics at the 
			University of California at Davis and the former assistant secretary 
			of economics at the Agriculture Department during the first Bush 
			administration. </p>
			<p>Hired as a consultant by Brazil, Mr. Sumner created an economic 
			model showing that American cotton subsidies did lead United States 
			farmers to plant more cotton, causing increased American exports and 
			pushing down world prices. Had the farmers not received the 
			subsidies, he wrote in a thick submission for the W.T.O. panel, 
			United States exports would have declined on average by 41.2 percent 
			and the world price of upland cotton would have increased by 12.6 
			percent. </p>
			<p>The United States countered with its own submission that 
			critiqued Mr. Sumner's analysis, saying it was flawed and failed to 
			factor in the normal ups and downs of the world market. </p>
			<p>Several members of the cotton industry met with Mr. Sumner and 
			told him he was a turncoat. </p>
			<p>&quot;One person told me that if this were a military question, what I 
			did would be treason,&quot; said Mr. Sumner, who said he stood by his 
			work. </p>
			<p>&quot;I don't come at this sort of thing for any reason but that the 
			best possible evidence is entered in this dispute process,&quot; he said. 
			&quot;I am a very strong supporter of multilateral efforts, and I want 
			the dispute process of the W.T.O. to be as fair as possible.&quot; </p>
