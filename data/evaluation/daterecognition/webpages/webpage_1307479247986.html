				<p>We will be offering the original Soloflex next month with the launch of our new website. We have been energized by all of your comments. We know we can bring the classic Soloflex to a new generation of users. Perhaps with a greater emphasis on the free weight options. I think that producing a few commercials in the same style as the hybrid videos, would be a huge success. There really is no better, safer alternative to barbell exercises than the original Soloflex. We are launching a few ads on cable for our WBV platform and the Lift, but also look forward to relaunching what is the best and most versatile home gym ever created. Thank you for all the support and encouragement!</p>

			<p>Yay!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping for some of the other recently discontinued goodies to become available too, like the Compoound Barbell, and the Organizers.</p>
<p>Awesome, lets kick some Bowflex and Total Gym butt!</p>

			<p>Great! Wonderful news! Fantastic!</p>
<p>I learned to love freeweights because of the Classic Soloflex. </p>
<p>Everyone who worked out on one with me always agreed that their favorite was a combination of freeweights &amp; the resistance bands.</p>
<p>Currently I use the Soloflex dumbbells (the 60lb. set &amp; Soloflex flat bench) along with a power tower.</p>
<p>I will always have a soft (hard?) spot in my memories for my 1984 Classic Soloflex, I still have it my garage (albeit, disassembled).</p>
<p>I always felt that Soloflex never really emphasized the freeweight adaptability of the classic machine, seeing as this was the biggest overall advantage the machine had over all the other &#8220;competitors&#8221;.</p>
<p>Your marketing of the Soloflex brand as a true and safe weightlifting line of machines has been a long time in coming.</p>
<p>The Classic Soloflex &amp; The Soloflex Lift: Lift hard, Lift long, Lift Lift safe, Lift Soloflex!</p>
<p>&#8230;and of course it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to bring back the 60lb. dumbbell set or maybe even the Armchair Quarterback! :)</p>

			<p>I have two classics with the wooden bench. Can I get the leather pad for both of them? I was going to make them but time is tight these days. Also, will you be re-issuing the original bungee cords?</p>

			<p>That is great!  What about pricing-  How much will the Soloflex cost now?  Would love to see you bring back the original Oak bench like the one shown above!</p>

			<p>Will this new soloflex machine be manufactured in the USA to the same specifications as the original machine? I am very excited to hear the news. Is there a chance of the wooden bench being offered again?</p>

			<p>Finally! It is about time a second generation discover the Soloflex.<br />
The hybrid videos have energized us all by showing us our old machines in a new light.  With a whole array of new possibilities.  By using the tube bands with my Classic Soloflex bench I find that there are far more exercises than I will ever use. And all of a sudden my machine seems to have more value built into it.</p>
<p>I have been intrigued by the guy in the hybrid videos.  Both videos have bought us a new message about our machines and said to us that<br />
we already have the tools we need to get the beautiful, strong, healthy bodies that we bought our Soloflexes for in the first place.  </p>
<p>My insider sorce (Dinjin1963&#8217;s profile page attached to his YouTube videos) picked up this conversation between Dinjin1963 and one of his subscribers concerning his 3rd video:</p>
<p>  Dinjin1963 (2 hours ago) You are welcome socoant2. Thanks for the webpage idea. I will think it over. The Beast should be finished this weekend. The construction part, that is. After that I will give it a good test run to make certain it is very solid. At last count the Beast is capable of 116 individual exercises. That is 16 more than the best Bowflex. It will also have 5 different types of resistances to workout with. It is good to hear from you.? Stick with your Soloflex routine. Bye.  </p>
<p>  socoant2 (6 hours ago) Thanks for? the info, you should make a webpage with all the tips. Cant wait to see the BEAST.</p>

			<p>Great #^@^#^!#  news.   Yes, awesome news.   Thanks for taking our comments into serious consideration.  I really felt that bringing back the Classic Soloflex was moral issue.   Never before in our American history have our Children, teenagers, and young adults have been in this type of horrible state of health before.  This new generation needs to know the truth about the best home gym ever invented.   These kids are constantly lied to by diet commercials and inferior exercise equipment.  I’m very happy to know that rescue is on its way and these poor kids need it more now than we did back then. </p>
<p>In the summer of 1989 before the 10th grade; I was bench pressing in my bed room alone while listening to loud music.  I was not using a Soloflex but a regular bench Station with free weights.  After a couple of sets the weights became too heavy and did not have the strength to put them back.  Next thing I know, the bar bounced off my chest and towards my throat…I remember losing consciousness and feeling  that I was a gone…&#8230;If it was not for my older brother walking in my room to tell me to lower the music….He  found  me almost past out.   A month later my mother, brother and I took a drive to Santa Monica’s Soloflex store; I never looked back.   I still work out alone in my room but without fear.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m too busy to hang out at a gym and I find it easier to stick to a workout plan at home because it&#8217;s easier to do. Don&#8217;t have to drive anywhere, don&#8217;t have to wait in long lines to bench press, and nobody is walking into my bedroom offering steroids.  My soloflex and a pair of dumb bells is all I need. I drink lots of water and avoid fast food.</p>

			<p>As I have said before and will say again there is nothing like a soloflex a piece of art a muscle machine that works I have tried gym machines and free weights but for a 45 year old I attribute my fittness level and good health to one machine my machine my soloflex my wife bought it for me in 1992 and it has outlasted all other pieces of equipment that I have purchased over the years.The one the only Soloflex muscle machine. There is no equal. Thanks Soloflex the classic is truely the best</p>

			<p>Garett,<br />
  Bad news. According to Connie, Soloflex doesn&#8217;t play to make the organizers or the Compound Barbell again. Terrible news considering the quality of the products.</p>

			<p>Guys,<br />
I have the organizer and it is nice, BUT&#8230; before, I would just lean the Leg Extension against the wall, hang the Butterfly (carefully) over, hang the straps on the pins of the Leg Extension and neatly place other items around it.  I got the organizer, set it up, and thought it was cool&#8230; but at the same time, my way worked just as well and actually took up about the same space.<br />
My favorite classic, is my 1984 as well&#8230; no wait, it&#8217;s my 1979 model.  The original bungees were my favorite, then the Gates Straps.  The 1983/84 all stainless Ring-Pin was the best. It floated along with the Lever Arm&#8230; and doubled as the Roman Chair Pin. Ahhh&#8230;</p>

			<p>We are getting bids so we can also offer a retro bench with the pad again. I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll be able to offer just the padding? My opinion is that a retro Soloflex with the wood bench plus weight plates is the way to go. It would be fun to play on that theme by having our model wear that same head band. Maybe even some tube socks and short shorts ;) Everything comes back around. We need to market the Soloflex so it&#8217;s appealing to people in there 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s.</p>

			<p>The standard bench will be the oak version then?  I know the fully padded bench was considered an &#8220;improvement&#8221; over the original wood bench, but for exercises where you stand on the bench I much preferred the oak one, and I found it comfortable to sit/lie on.  Looks cool too!  What will the pricing be for the basic Soloflex set up, no attachments?? </p>
<p>Also, any plans for a 25lb. weight plate from Soloflex?  Having the maximum at 10lbs. limits options with the dumbbells, and if you want to emphasize the weight plate adaptability of the Soloflex, a larger matching plate would be nice.</p>

			<p>If Soloflex were to produce 25 pound weights I would HOPE they would consider reintroducing the Soloflex Compound Barbell. That barbell was fantastic! Too bad my brother won&#8217;t return it to me; I gave it to him because I had stopped lifting for a while. Trying to find one on ebay or Craigs is practically impossible. </p>
<p>If ANYONE has one they want to let go&#8230;let me know!!!</p>

			<p>Molly,<br />
I didn&#8217;t realize we were talking about a Retro Classic Soloflex MM.  This is too good to be true!  I&#8217;ve been saying &#8220;bring the original back&#8221; for years&#8230; even to you guys.  How great!  Hardwood Bench and all?  I might cry.</p>
<p>I have my Dad&#8217;s &#8216;79 machine, my &#8216;83/&#8217;84 (late &#8216;83) machine, a &#8216;86 machine someone gave me, my &#8216;88 machine (&#8217;cause I thought I needed all the upgrades), and an &#8216;02 that someone left behind in a move. Kind of crazy, I know.  But I will always believe that the pre-1985 machines are where I would have stopped (pretty much) had it been up to me.<br />
Here&#8217;s why;</p>
<p>Malaysian Hardwood and oak benches simply workout better on the machine, look better, suit it better, and just plain make more since for standing exercises and stability in general. (and rubber tape replacement on the bottom works out better too) The leather saddle can be supplemented with Office Supply black mouse pads placed on the bench for any exercise that requires a little comfort assistance&#8230;or a towel. This bench, is just plain better. </p>
<p>The Bench pin should not only be Stainless Steel again (as it originally was) but un-knurled as well&#8230; smooth handle. I know at a glance or by feel which pin I have in my hand. </p>
<p>HERE&#8217;S THE BIGGY !!!  PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT OVER-BEND THE MAINFRAME UP TO 93 DEGREES AS YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN SINCE AROUND &#8216;86/&#8217;87.  I CAN&#8217;T TELL YOU ENOUGH HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE IT MAKES ON EXERCISES (I.E., LEG PRESS, ANY PULL DOWN, PULL-UPS/CHIN UPS) ESPECIALLY LEVER-ARM HOLE PLACEMENT IN THE UPPER HOLE REGION WHERE THE OVER-BEND STARTS TO REALLY EFFECT THINGS. THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE REASON I PREFER MY EARLY MACHINES.  WORKING OUT SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH EARLY AND LATER MODELS I FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT IT WAS ABOUT THE EARLY ONES THAT MADE ME PREFER THEM. I KNOW WHY SOLOFLEX DID IT, BUT IF ASSEMBLY-SAFETY/POSSIBLE MAINFRAME FALLING BACKwards IS WORTH SUCH A DRASTIC CHANGE TO ITS FUNCTION, THEN JUST CHANGE THE DIRECTIONS TO HAVE TWO PEOPLE ASSIST EACH OTHER WHEN ATTACHING THE TWO PIECES. I CAN&#8217;T STRESS THIS ENOUGH. A 90 DEGREE MAINFRAME &#8211; LIKE IT WAS DESIGNED FROM THE BEGINNING. NOT &#8220;UP TO 93 DEGREES&#8221;. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. I&#8217;M 6 FEET TALL AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. IF YOU WANT ME TO ELABORATE ON WHY I CAN, JUST ASK. MAYBE YOU GUYS GO BACK TO THE WELDED MAINFRAME&#8230; DID I SAY THAT? :-)</p>
<p>ALSO, NO SEMI-GLOSS POWDERCOAT. AGAIN, FUNCTIONALITY. THE ORIGINAL FLAT FINISH GRIPPED BETTER WITH SWEATY HANDS, DID NOT CHIP SO DEEP (ESPACIALLY AT THE DIP BAR ATTACH POINT), AND WAS EASIER TO TOUCH-UP WHEN REQUIRED. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d even (if possible) leave off the black paint on the (4) Barbell Arm welded pins. It looked better as well&#8230; more tool-like&#8230; in an artistic way. </p>
<p>I know you&#8217;ll choose to go with the two-piece machined load pin so I won&#8217;t go into the Ring Pin thing. I&#8217;ll just say, &#8220;I prefer the simplicity, beauty, and floating action of the all-in-one stainless steel unpainted Ring Pin&#8221;. :-)</p>
<p>The wood bench deserves some kind of embedded signifier as to being a &#8220;Soloflex Classic &#8211; 30 year Celebration&#8221; model. A round embedded, vintage brass embossed medallion kind of thing. I know you know what I mean, one of your early competitors did this on their wood bench and I thought at the time it was something that belonged on a SF MM.</p>
<p>Thank you for allowing us input, on something that many of us have valuable user input that can really help.</p>
<p>You guys invented the first and still best. Name something else you can honestly say that about, that&#8217;s still around.  You got it right the first time.</p>

			<p>With regards to bringing back the wood bench on the Classic Soloflex, you may want to explore the idea of making it, this time, using bamboo. Certain bamboo can be harder than either oak or maple. The compressed slat look can be achieved using this product&#8230;it would look just like the original. However it would be more sustainable for the environment, and be another unique talking point in the relaunch.</p>

			<p>Just recently i was finally able to purchase a Soloflex Muscle Machine with all the attachments for $180 and everything was in very good to excellent condition from lack of use. I&#8217;ve been lifting weights since the age of 13. The weights were always dumbells and Olympic plates. Always been athletic, playing football in high school and div. 1 football in college. From football to powerlifting, competitive bodybuilding, to marathon running. </p>
<p>I was always intrigue by the &#8216;concept&#8217; and &#8216;functionality&#8217; of the Soloflex. I currently like the concept of the user who somewhat &#8216;created&#8217; the hybrid-soloflex. Allowing the user to use both weight bands/weight plates. I think for the &#8216;new&#8217; generation of soloflex users this aspect needs to be marketed. I also think that soloflex should also incorporate those &#8216;extended&#8217; legs so users can perform back extensions.</p>
<p>I would like to suggest a &#8216;redesign&#8217; of the leg extension. Maybe considering having the &#8216;extended&#8217; leg on a 20 or 30 degree angle. The current angle makes it difficult for &#8216;mesomorphs&#8217; to get a good leg extension/leg curl workout with this piece.</p>
<p>Finally along the design lines of the current butterfly attachment, consider a &#8216;lateral raise&#8217; attachment which allows the user to work the delts. My thought on this is that it can connect the same way the b-fly attachment connects. Obviously i haven&#8217;t figured out all of the mechanics on this, just an idea.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work and much success!</p>

			<p>Wow this is great news. Will the rubber weight straps and butterfly and leg attachments still be compatible with the new &#8220;retro&#8217; machine? I prefer the rubber weight straps and attachments as the leg attachment gives you certain exercises besides leg exercises. </p>
<p>Alot of people still use these but they need to be modified or &#8216;improved&#8217;. A option for these would be nice to have for the new &#8216;retro&#8217; machine. </p>
<p>I second the notion that promoting the &#8216;free weight&#8217; option is the way to go. Maybe make a updated free weight bar attachments for the classic machine. </p>
<p>Sounds great, keep up the good work.</p>

			<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Yes, we are very happy to see the Retro.  It is being very well received as well.  We are currently running a back log of 6 weeks.  The rubber straps and the shock rings will work for all of the Soloflex machines and attachments.  They can even be used side by side.  </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your comments and checking us out.<br />

			<p>If you&#8217;re dieting, &#8220;don&#8217;t go to a restaurant completely famished,&#8221; says New York City nutritionist Lisa Sasson. She suggests having a protein-rich snack such as one or two hard-boiled egg whites or a small apple with a little cheese beforehand.</p>

			<p>Hi everyone.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never used either the more recent Soloflex (the one with the rounded frame) or the new Retro Soloflex (with the wooden bench and square frame), and I&#8217;m torn about which to get.  The Retro model is apparently lighter, and people seem to like the wooden bench and the old weight straps, but it doesn&#8217;t have leg or butterfly extensions, which I was particularly looking forward to using.  </p>
<p>So, is the consensus that those attachments really aren&#8217;t that important to have, and that the Retro model is the way to go?  Are there other good reasons for choosing one model over the other?</p>
<p>Also, how much do these models weigh, and how much space (H x W x L) do people find they need to allocate?   (I live in an apartment.)   </p>
<p>Many thanks for any advice and tips people could provide!</p>

			<p>Hi Leo,<br />
Thank you for your questions.  The Classic Soloflex and Retro Soloflex are both great.  There are many people that believe the butterfly and leg extension are not necessary.  Mr. Wilson, the inventor and owner, believes they are a nice addition but not as important as the main machine itself.  The Retro does draw many fans that want the hard wood bench and they believe the 90 degree on the main frame is more stable.  It does not require the bench legs for stability.  The Classic is loved by those who like the sexy curves and more modern look.  We do have some people order the Classic and do not add the leg and butterfly.  By far the most popular is the Classic Soloflex with the leg extension and butterfly by a great number.</p>
<p>The Classic with the leg extension and butterfly weight 228lbs and is 4&#8242; wide x 4&#8242; deep x 6&#8242; tall.  The leg extension adds another foot when it is on the machine.  The Retro is 168lbs with out the leg and butterfly and it is also 4&#8242; wide x 4&#8242; deep x 6&#8242; tall.  </p>
<p>I hope this helps.  </p>
<p>Thank you.<br />
Connie</p>
