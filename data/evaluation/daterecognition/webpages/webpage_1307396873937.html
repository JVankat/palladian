      <p class="MainBoldBrown"><strong>&nbsp;Mission:</strong></p>
      <p class="MainBold">To provide you the highest quality products at rock 
        bottom prices. We strive to offer you great customer service. Our policies 
        are designed to be fair to all parties involved. Please contact us if 
        you have any questions.</p>
      <p class="MainBoldBrown"><strong>Lowest price guarantee:</strong></p>
      <p class="MainBold">If you find a competitors website with a lower price 
        on the exact same product we will meet or beat that price. </p>
      <p class="MainBoldBrown"><strong>Conditions on our price guarantee: </strong></p>
      <p class="MainBold">&#149;&nbsp; <strong>The item you are comparing us to 
        must be new and in stock </strong></p>
      <p class="MainBold">&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Prices based on item itself and 
        not part of a package </strong></p>
      <p class="MainBold">&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Auctions are not considered comparisons 
        </strong></p>
      <p class="MainBold">&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Since we offer free shipping on 
        many items and/or for a specific amount purchased, total price including 
        shipping must be considered. </strong></p>
      <p class="MainBold">&#149;&nbsp; <strong>We cannot compete with going out 
        of business sales, liquidation sales or sales below our wholesale costs. 
        </strong></p>
      <p class="MainBold">&#149;&nbsp; <strong>Please note that while we do offer 
        very low prices we also offer you much more in the way of customer service. 
        We use all the products we sell and can help you every step of the way. 
        Many times auction or liquation items may be at a very low price but if 
        you are left with an item you don't know how to use or where to go for 
        support it can be frustrating and costly in the long run. </strong></p>
      <p class="MainBoldBrown"><strong>Trade in policy: </strong></p>
      <p><span class="MainBold">We offer a trade in allowance on grain mills and 
        mixers. This allowance does differ depending on the condition of the item 
        you are trading in. Please contact us for details. We also offer a �you 
        sell it yourself� program. Please call (1-888-303-4659), email: <a href="info@mountaintopsmilling.com">info@mountaintopsmilling.com</a>

      <p><strong class="MainBoldBrown">Returns: </strong></p>
      <p class="MainBold">Your satisfaction is important to us, which is why we 
        offer the BEST REFUND/RETURN policy in the business. We realize that purchasing 
        an item like a grain mill or mixer over the internet without actually 
        being able to touch and demo the product is difficult. This is why we 
        have instituted a 100% satisfaction guarantee for all of the NEW grain 
        mills and mixers we carry! </p>
      <p class="MainBold"><strong>Please see the refund &amp; return policy guidelines 
        for specifics. <u>Please note our return policy for new grain mills and

        includes items that were shipped to you free of charge still had incurred 
        shipping costs to us and these costs will be deducted from your refund.</p>
      <p class="MainBold">Note: We hope that you research the products that you 
        are purchasing. We are more than happy to assist you but the ultimate 
        decision is yours. If the item doesn't perform to your expectations after 
        the warranty period you may have to pay for repairs yourself. It's always 
        best to really research the items and it's always good to purchase items 
        that have been proven over time. We NEVER will give you advice to purchase 
        a product just to make a sale. However, we have seen over the years that 
        new products look and work great in the beginning but may not be up to 
        our satisfaction after a few years of use.</p>
      <p class="MainBold"><u>Bank charges :</u> If a check is returned insufficient 
        and we are charged from our bank the customer is liable to pay for the 
        bank charge.</p>
      <p class="MainBold">If a customer is charged a bank charge due to insufficient 
        funds Mountain Tops Milling will NOT reimburse for any incurred bank charges. 
      </p>
      <p class="MainBold">Overdue accounts: Payment is requested at the time of 
        purchase. Payments over 30 days will accrue charges of 5% the balance 
        due until paid, unless other arrangements have been made. This does not 
        apply to our layaway plan customers. If a payment goes past 60 days Mountain 
        Tops Milling will put the account into collections and bill the customer 
        for the balance due in addition to any costs in collecting the debt. </p>
      <p class="MainBoldBrown">Warranty claims: </p>
      <p class="MainBold">Each manufacture have different warranty policy and 
        procedures. These policies may change at any time and it's up to the customer 
        to check out the warranty policy/procedures directly with the manufacture. 
        All warranty work/decisions are up to the different manufacturer's and 
        are not up to Mountain Tops Milling. Please contact the manufacture directly 
        for any warranty issues/repairs. We will be happy to direct you to the 
        proper departments. Please note that in many instances the customer pays 
        to ship the item to the manufacture for repairs. </p>
      <p class="MainBoldBrown">Refused deliveries: </p>
      <p class="MainBold">Refused deliveries and order cancellations received
