        <h3>Information about the next phase of your life</h3>

        <p><i>Older people have the right to Independence, Participation, Care, Self-fulfilment and Dignity &#8211; <a href="/infocentre/unprinciples"><small>United Nations Principles for Older Persons</small></a></i></p>

        <h3>The best age is the age you are</h3>

        <p>Older age has challenges and rewards. It&#8217;s a time when you can rest from the demands of regular work and do some of the things you enjoy. Your attitudes to ageing can also affect you mentally, physically and emotionally. Therefore it is important to be positive and to consider what you personally want out of life.</p>

        <p>It may be that our want to improve your fitness and health, increase your involvement in activities and interests, or extend your social networks so that this really is the best time of your life.</p>

        <h3>Setting goals and making action plans</h3>

        <p>Often people only "dream" about what they would like to do. Getting something down on paper and making a commitment to it is a good way to begin to make it happen.</p>

        <h2>Planning</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Think about what you would like to achieve short term and long term.</li>

          <li>Write these down as your goals.</li>

          <li>List the key steps needed to achieve each goal and when each step must be completed. This is your action plan.</li>

          <li>Identify any problems that may stop your achieving a particular step or the goal.</li>

          <li>Decide how you will deal with these potential problems and adjust your plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Start with something that you know you can/will do, because achieving a goal provides the motivation to try other things. You can do anything provided you take just one step at a time.</p>

        <h3>Health</h3>

        <p>Regular exercise, a balanced diet and stress management are vital components to health. There are programmes and activities that suit all levels of ability. It&#8217;s a matter of knowing what appeals and how to get started.</p>

        <h3>Involvement in activities and interests</h3>

        <p>Participation and commitment are key words in acquiring a sense of satisfaction and enjoying quality of life. Try to get a variety between physical, mental and spiritual, individual and group activities. Be alert for things you&#8217;d like to do in the future and be prepared to give them a go.</p>

        <h2>Recreation</h2>

        <p>Most people develop interests and hobbies during their lifetime and find that in older age they have more time to spend on them. Others focus more on work and may feel useless and bored when they are no longer employed.</p>

        <p>Find out what is available in your community:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Sample a new hobby like stamp collecting, writing poetry, ham radio.</li>

          <li>Enjoy bridge, chess, board games with friends at home or local groups.</li>

          <li>Join a group for physical activity and get involved in social activities as well.</li>

          <li>Attend creative courses in art, poetry, stained glass, wood turning, embroidery.</li>

          <li>Start piano lessons or a musical appreciation class.</li>

          <li>Try more daring activities, like sky diving, abseiling, handgliding.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It&#8217;s never too late to find something you enjoy. Take a few minutes to write a list of all the things you would like to do and build it into your action plan.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>Opportunities for continued learning are increasingly available, through universities, polytechnics and extra-mural courses. Studying can be fun, especially if it&#8217;s done in a group.</p>

        <p>Learn more about:</p>

        <p>Mental stimulation is important to keep the mind active and alert.</p>

        <h2>Community</h2>

        <p>Everyone has valuable knowledge and skills that can be put to use. Many other people find satisfaction and a sense of purpose in giving time and energy on a voluntary basis to groups in their community.</p>

        <table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
          <tr>

        <h2>Exercise</h2>

        <p>Stamina, suppleness and strength may decrease with age, but often lack of use is a major problem. Regular exercise improves mobility, flexibility and circulation. Start slowly and gently and gradually building up to a comfortable level. Try different activities to find what suits you best.</p>

        <p>Find out what you enjoy:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Walking &#8211; the simplest and cheapest form of exercise. You could join a walking group or start your own with friends. Half an hour of brisk walking three times a week helps fitness.</li>

          <li>Tramping, bushwalking &#8211; take more time, but are enjoyed by many. Organised groups available in most areas.</li>

          <li>Swimming, aquacise &#8211; popular classes for older people at most public pools.</li>

          <li>Dancing &#8211; old time, country, square, rock and roll are all fun exercise and a way of meeting others.</li>

          <li>Cycling &#8211; on your own or with a club.</li>

          <li>Gardening &#8211; good for flexibility.</li>

          <li>Sports such as yachting, golf, bowls and croquet offer good outdoor exercise.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your local CAB or Age Concern can put you in touch with local group offering different forms of exercise.</p>

        <h2>Nutrition</h2>

        <p>A balanced diet, with a variety of food is best at all ages. Avoid faddist diets or over-emphasis on certain aspects of diet, without medical advice. Each day eat something from each of the four food groups:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Vegetables and fruits.</li>

          <li>Breads and cereals.</li>

          <li>Milks and milk products.</li>

          <li>Lean meat, chicken, seafood, eggs, dried beans, peas and lentils.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Try and maintain a healthy weight for your build. Being too thin or too fat increases the chance of developing health problems.</p>

        <h2>Stress</h2>

        <p>Sometimes changes in life can cause stress that leaves you feeling you are not coping as well as usual. Try to relieve tension as it occurs by:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Relaxing &#8211; let your mind and body unwind.</li>

          <li>Avoiding pressuring yourself to achieve.</li>

          <li>Undertaking what you can do and no more.</li>

          <li>Breathing slowly and deeply.</li>

          <li>Sharing your concerns with someone you trust who understands.</li>

          <li>Trying not to rely on cigarettes, alcohol and sleeping pills.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The range is too large to note all the possibilities. Whatever your skills, there&#8217;ll be a place for you.</p>

        <h3>Social networks</h3>

        <p>Establishing social networks is a key factor in successful ageing. Research has shown that those with social support live longer, recover quicker from illness, deal better with stress and have improved health. As well, the ability to cope and a sense of control are increased.</p>

        <p>In your communication with others:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Listen attentively</li>

          <li>Respond positively</li>

          <li>Keep interested in the world around you</li>

          <li>Be honest about your feelings</li>

          <li>Learn to celebrate differences</li>

          <li>Repeat statements or questions if you think you have not been heard.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Family</h2>

        <p>Contact with family is mutually caring and supportive for most people. Sometimes, family do not live handy or there are no near relatives and an older person may become isolated. Older adults in this situation can &#8216;adopt&#8217; a family and become acting grandparents.</p>

        <h2>Friends</h2>

        <p>Friends can help you maintain a positive self-image, reinforce self-esteem, offer continuity and stability, provide emotional, spiritual and psychological support and come to your aid when required. Keeping in contact with your peer group is important. Making new friends from all age groups is revitalising.</p>

        <p>For those who do not have friends or family to turn to, remember that Age Concern or other similar agencies or groups have trained people who will listen to you and understand your needs. It may be hard to ask for help if you have always been an independent person, but it can be a very positive step to take.</p>

        <p>The risk of abuse and neglect can be reduced by considering and planning for future needs. The older person knows and usually trusts the person abusing him/her. The abuser may be a spouse, partner, adult child, grandchild, carer, friend, neighbour, paid caregiver or any other person in a position of trust.</p>

        <h3><a name="planningahead" id="planningahead"></a>Planning ahead</h3>

        <p>All older people can be at risk of abuse and neglect. Protect yourself by making decisions, based on informed advice now, rather later when you may be in a more vulnerable position.</p>

        <p>Whatever your personal circumstances, attention to some key issues will ensure that you retain your independence and control of your assets and property for as long as you wish.</p>

        <p>Planning ahead can involve:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Deciding who will take responsibility for finances, property, care and welfare matters in the event of future incapacity</li>

          <li>Considering the implications before making major lifestyle changes</li>

          <li>Taking practical steps to protect finances and property</li>

          <li>Seeking independent advice before making major decision or lifestyle changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Set clear boundaries and discuss these with the people involved so they do not take advantage of you.</li>

          <li>Keep in touch with family and friends and maintain your community networks.</li>

          <li>Develop interests that you can maintain in the event of changes in your health or other circumstances.</li>

          <li>Explain your needs and carefully consider your choice of attorney(s) and their responsibilities, for example, how, when and to whom the attorney(s) will report.</li>

          <li>Review your Enduring Power of Attorney as your circumstances or relationships change.</li>

          <li>Make a Will and review it as circumstances change.</li>

          <li>Consider your future housing needs and find out about other options before you become unable to manage in your current home.</li>

          <li>Think very carefully about the consequences of moving in with family/friends or having them to live with you. Discuss the matter with someone you trust who is not directly involved.</li>

          <li>Seek independent legal advice to make sure you are protected if you provide finance for a property owned by family or others even when you intend to live with the owners.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Remember that older people have the right to make decisions and remain independent for as long as possible.</li>

          <li>Talk with older family members about their wishes while they are able to participate fully. Age Concern has a <a href="/infocentre/factsheets"><i>Facing Change</i> factsheet</a> giving advice on these discussions.</li>

          <li>Ensure older family members have information, or know where to get information, about matters that affect them.</li>

          <li>Encourage positive relationships between the generations and ensure that boundaries are openly discussed and agreed.</li>

          <li>Carefully consider the needs of your own family before taking an older family member into your home, for example, how will the arrangements affect you, your partner and children.</li>

          <li>Consider the practical details of providing care in your home, for example, bathroom and toilet facilities, cooking and sleeping arrangements, privacy and time out.</li>

          <li>Carefully consider the implications before moving in with an older family member, such as different lifestyles, values and beliefs.</li>

          <li>Delay making permanent, long-term decisions in a crisis. For example, on the death of one parent take time to consider and discuss options with your remaining parent before taking any action.</li>

          <li>Consult extended family members about the care of an older family member.</li>

          <li>Find out about the services that are available in the community to assist older people, their family and carers.</li>

          <li>Do not feel you have failed if you are unable to provide care or need to relinquish care at home.</li>

          <li>Consider your own needs and plan ahead.</li>

        <h3><a name="askingforhelp" id="askingforhelp"></a>Asking for help</h3>

        <p>Asking for help at any time can be very difficult but it can be especially traumatic in situations involving elder abuse and neglect. Older people may be very reluctant to tell anyone that abuse or neglect is occurring, due to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the abuse or neglect involving a family member, carer, friend, neighbour, paid caregiver, or other person in a position of trust.</li>

          <li>reliance on that person in some way</li>

          <li>feeling responsible/guilty/to blame for their situation</li>

          <li>lack of knowledge about the services and support that is available</li>

          <li>lack of knowledge about other care options that may be available</li>

          <li>fear that options would be worse than the abuse or neglect.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Families and carers may also find it difficult to ask for help due to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>feeling obligated or responsible for providing care</li>

          <li>being reliant emotionally, financially or in some other way on the person they care for</li>

          <li>feeling guilty, ashamed or fearful</li>

          <li>lack of knowledge about the services and support that is available</li>

          <li>lack of knowledge about other care options</li>

          <li>lack of awareness that their actions are abusive.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Help is available!</b></p>

        <p>Many situations involving elder abuse and neglect can be resolved by talking matters through with someone who understands the issues. For example:</p>

        <h3>Keep connected, says retiree</h3>

        <p><b>At 72, Leo McKendry could be seen as a poster boy for Men&rsquo;s Health promotion.</b></p>

        <p>As a former district and regional councillor, three-time mayor of Blenheim and principal of a successful motor dealership Leo isn&rsquo;t shy about being active.</p>

        <p>Living in one of the sunniest parts of New Zealand, and blessed with relatively good health, comfortable income, young grandchildren and plenty of interesting employment opportunities, he seems to be in a enviable position.</p>

        <p>However, he believes the secrets of positive ageing are available to any men.</p>

        <p>The key is never mentally stopping work, he says.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Your working life is not a switch you turn off suddenly. Whether you do voluntary work, part-time work, or casual work, the key is to keep connected.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>&ldquo;A friend of mine retired determined to have a permanent holiday. Golf was fine for the first three months, but then what do you do?&rdquo; A good retirement also takes planning. &ldquo;You should start planning for your retirement from age 40, or at least 50,&rdquo; Leo believes.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;If you have your own business, have a successor in place and gradually scale down your involvement. If you have a job you can discuss a gradual move to part-time work with your employer, rather than their suddenly losing you at 65.</p>

        <p>Leo says it&rsquo;s vital that men keep connected with their interests, their community and their medical advisers as they age.</p>

        <p>Leo&rsquo;s years in the motor trade affect the way he talks about health care. &ldquo;Keep up the preventative maintenance &ndash; on your car and your body,&rdquo; he advises.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;Get any overhaul you need done while you&rsquo;re still working. Do running repairs as they&rsquo;re needed. Have a complete warrant of fitness at age 45 and keep the check-ups going after that.</p>

        <p>Leo believes the old stereotypes of men neglecting their health are decreasing. At 45 he had his first major check-up, now he visits health carers regularly. Some health issues have been successfully overcome, but others remain. &ldquo;I have hypertension and I&rsquo;ll have it till I die &ndash; a legacy of working too hard perhaps. But with my doctor&rsquo;s help it&rsquo;s under control.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>He also exercises with weights and golfs regularly.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a shocking golfer,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a three and a half mile walk, and all that swinging of the clubs is good exercise. You don&rsquo;t see many obese golfers.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Age Concern New Zealand has designed a self-help resource called Ageing is Living to help people plan for their retirement. It is filled with advice and scenarios to help readers achieve good retirements like Leo&rsquo;s.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;There are so many opportunities out there. You just need to be open to them,&rdquo; concludes Leo McKendry.</p>

        <h2>What is a Grandparent?</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"My grandchildren have enriched my life, given me a sense of purpose and a desire to remain healthy for as long as I can."</i> <small>Graham, aged 73</small></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The relationship between a grandparent and grandchild can be mutually fulfilling and rewarding for both the older person and the younger child. Grandparenting is not necessarily confined to the natural grandparents: a family friend or a neighbour sometimes fulfils this important role.</p>

        <p>A Grandparent plays a very important role in the family today, for example as:</p>

        <p>Successful relationships between grandparents and grandchildren are based on love, mutual respect and honesty. Relationships are two-way and affection cannot be bought. Respect too, must be earned, it is not given as a right.</p>

        <p>Grandparenting can offer a second chance to participate in parenting and enjoying children. There are usually fewer pressures and demands on grandparents which means they are able to be more relaxed and tolerant and can complement the role of parents.</p>

        <p>Grandchildren can also learn new and different ways of seeing the world from their grandparents.</p>

        <h3>Suggestions for Grandparents</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>value your own wisdom and experience as parents</li>

          <li>respect and support your children's parenting views</li>

          <li>offer to look after your grandchildren to give their parents a break</li>

          <li>discuss your availability for childminding and discuss your wishes about frequency of holiday visits</li>

          <li>most important of all - have fun with your grandchildren!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Intergenerational Bonds</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"The nice thing about Nana and Grandad is that they say that we have two homes - one with our parents and one with them."</i> <small>Thomas and James, aged 8</small></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Strong friendship bonds can exist between grandparents and grandchildren which overcome the barriers sometimes associated with differences in age.</p>

        <p>The three generations - grandparents/parents/grandchildren - have much to learn from one other and effective communication is essential to this learning. Listening to each other and respecting those differences that make individuals unique are particularly important.</p>

        <h3>Some Ideas On Communicating with your Grandchild</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>try not to say too much, instead listen to what the child is saying to you</li>

          <li>avoid giving unasked for advice</li>

          <li>never yell at, lecture, command or hit a child</li>

          <li>encourage the child to talk about their problems/feelings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Parents' Role</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"I find it difficult to say to my mother that I think she is sometimes too hard on the children, and it worries me that the children are often reluctant to visit her."</i> <small>Carol, aged 37</small></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Parents play an important role in influencing how well relationships work between the generations. Parents are often pivotal to the success of the grandparent/grandchild relationship but can sometimes feel trapped by the demands of both.</p>

        <h3>Suggestions for Parents</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>keep the lines of communication open between the grandparent(s) and yourself, instead of complaining that they're too involved or not doing enough</li>

          <li>encourage the relationship between your children and their grandparents by letting them spend time together without you</li>

          <li>never assume grandparents are ready-made childminders</li>

          <li>make any important parenting rules clear, but give grandparents some leeway too</li>

          <li>remember that children are very versatile and can adapt easily to different codes of behaviour.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Differences</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"My koro is old on the outside and young on the inside."</i> <small>Arawhetu, aged 5</small></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Many families today are made up of people from different ethnic backgrounds and religious beliefs. Discussing and respecting different customs, views and beliefs is important as it can help overcome problems, promote understanding and lead to positive and enriching life experiences for all family members.</p>

        <h3>Useful suggestions</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>ensure grandparents have an opportunity to share aspects of their culture and life experiences</li>

          <li>ensure all family members talk about the features of differing cultures</li>

          <li>encourage your grandchildren to learn the language and customs of their cultural backgrounds</li>

          <li>learn the language and customs of your grandchildren's cultural backgrounds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Grandparenting from a Distance</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"To be a grandparent is an ever-changing privilege"</i> <small>Mary, aged 72</small></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Many families have grandchildren living throughout the world, while other families who live in the same country may live many miles away from one another. A grandchild and a grandparent who have not met for some years may find it difficult relating to one another with the result that neither benefits from the relationship in a meaningful way.</p>

        <h3>Suggestions for maintaining a close relationship</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>keep in contact frequently by phone, mail, fax and/or email</li>

          <li>exchange photographs several times a year</li>

          <li>make your own audio cassette, video tape or DVD and tell your grandchild about your childhood as well as your daily life</li>

          <li>use whatever skills you have to make something special for your grandchild, e.g. sewing, painting, woodwork, cooking</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changing Families</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"If you would like a warm relationship with your grandchildren don't leave it to chance - praise, encourage and hug them at every opportunity."</i> <small>Ta'ase, aged 64</small></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Marriage and relationship breakdown and remarriage can extend the family network and this can create new challenges and opportunities for families.</p>

        <p>Role confusion can arise when several sets of grandparents become part of the same family. Grandparents can feel unsure of the boundaries of their role and the relationship they should maintain with their grandchildren.</p>

        <p>Open communication between all family members is necessary to ensure that existing and new relationships are nurtured and strengthened. Having the chance to share in the experience and wisdom of a new grandparent can be very positive for all the members of a family.</p>

        <h2>Grandparents raising grandchildren</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"A grandparent is a parent who has a second chance."</i> <small>Rowan, aged 59</small></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For some grandparents, raising grandchildren becomes a full time role when mum or dad can't, or won't, or have been found by the court not to be suitable as primary caregiver.</p>

        <p>This may occur for many reasons, the most common being substance abuse, violence and mental illness of the parents. Raising grandchildren in these circumstances can be very challenging - emotionally, physically and financially. Support and information is available for grandparents in this situation - <b>contact Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Trust</b> on 0800 427 637 - 0800 GRANDS.</p>

        <p>There is no automatic right of access or custody by grandparents to their grandchildren. However, under the Care of Children Act 2004 a grandparent may seek an order from the Court concerning contact with or care of the child. If you are experiencing access or custody difficulties, consult a lawyer or your community law office, who will advise you of the legal situation.</p>

        <h3>Final Thought</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p><i>"The notion that I have contributed to two generations gives me an inner sense of acknowledgement and reward."</i> <small>Dorothy, aged 81</small></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>As people are living longer and are healthier in their older years there should be many years to share with grandchildren - and great-grandchildren!</p>

        <h3>How to take care of yourself by taking care with your medication.</h3>

        <p>If you take any kind of medication (medicine) it is important that you use it properly and obtain all the information you can about it.</p>

        <p>Medication affects different people in different ways and as people age the way their medication or its dosage affects them can also change. Incorrect dosage or mixing of medication can cause health problems such as confusion and disorientation.</p>

        <h3>Getting the right information about your medication from your doctor</h3>

        <p><b>Before you go to the doctor:</b></p>

        <p>1. Make a list of all the medications you are currently taking including the dosage and <b>when</b> you take them.</p>

        <p>This list should include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>medication prescribed by your doctor;</li>

          <li>any non-prescription medications such as cough mixture, aspirin, laxatives, creams or lotions used on the skin; and</li>

          <li>any vitamins or other supplements, and "natural" remedies obtained from health shops.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This will ensure that your doctor does not double up on medication you are already taking or prescribe medication that will react with something else you are taking.</p>

        <p>2. Write down a list of all the questions you want to ask about the medication you are currently taking and any other health issues that you want to discuss.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Remember to record all your symptoms and any other information that you consider might be important or helpful.</li>

          <li>Take this list with you to the doctor's and refer to it to make sure you don't forget any important questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>3. Consider taking a friend or relative with you to the doctor. This person can remind you of any questions you were going to ask and take notes of what the doctor says. Most people find doctor's visits a little stressful so don't be reluctant to use a support person.</p>

        <h3>During your visit to your doctor</h3>

        <p>1. Ask all the questions on your list - tick them off as they are answered and take notes to remind yourself later. If you find writing difficult ask the doctor or a friend you have brought with you to write down any instructions.</p>

        <p>If you find it embarrassing or difficult to ask about some matters, simply give a copy of your questions to the doctor.</p>

        <p>2. Show the doctor your list of current medications. Do not feel embarrassed to show the doctor this list - he or she will be pleased that you are taking responsibility for your health.</p>

        <p>3. Ask the following questions about any medication the doctor prescribes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What is the diagnosis (or aliment)?</li>

          <li>How long is this problem likely to last?</li>

          <li>What is this medication called?</li>

          <li>Is there any alternative to medication or to this particular medication?</li>

          <li>When should I take it, and how often?</li>

          <li>How long will I need to take it for and when should I have my use of it reviewed?</li>

          <li>Are there any special instructions or restrictions ? (Ask if you can drink alcohol while taking medication and ask about any restrictions on driving or using machinery as some medications cause drowsiness.)</li>

          <li>What are the common side effects?</li>

          <li>What should I do if I experience these or any other side effects?</li>

          <li>What should I do if I miss a dose?</li>

          <li>Is there anything else I should be doing to help myself?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is a good idea to write down these questions before you visit the doctor &#8211; or take this fact sheet with you, so can take notes.</p>

        <h3>At the pharmacy (chemist)</h3>

        <p>Your local retail pharmacist (chemist) is also a trained health professional and can give you a lot of information regarding your medication. If you forget to ask your doctor or can't remember his/her instructions, ask your pharmacist when you get your prescription filled.</p>

        <p>1. When buying medication which has not been prescribed by your doctor remember to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>tell the pharmacist what other medication you are taking, including any medication prescribed by your doctor, and check whether it is safe to take these medications together.</li>

          <li>ask about any known side effects from the non-prescription medication.</li>

          <li>ask how long you should take the non-prescription medication before checking with a doctor.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>2. When getting a prescription filled remember to ask whether any of the medications will deteriorate if taken out of the container or left exposed to the air and if any special care, e.g. refrigeration, is necessary.</p>

        <p>If you have trouble opening "child resistant" caps, ask if an easier opening container is available. However, remember to keep them out of reach of children.</p>

        <p>If your eyesight is poor ask the pharmacist if he/she can place the name of the medication and the instructions for taking it on a large label in big letters.</p>

        <h2>Organising your medication</h2>

        <p>If you take several kinds of medication or find you often forget to take your medication, it can be helpful to have a system to help you keep track of different medicines and to remind you to take them. Below are some ideas about how to organise your medication.</p>

        <h3>1. "Medicines I Take" Chart</h3>

        <p>Draw up the following on a piece of paper and fill it in for each medicine. Stick this to your fridge door or another place where you can find it easily.</p>

        <h3>3. Medication holders:</h3>

        <p><i>These can be purchased from your Pharmacy. They have a container for each day of the week and may have further divisions for different times of the day.</i></p>

        <p><i>At the start of each week you sort out a weeks supply of medication into the daily containers (you could use your "Medicines I Take" chart as a guide).</i></p>

        <p><i>At the end of each day you should check the container to make sure all medication has been taken.</i></p>

        <p><i>If you find sorting your medication difficult ask your pharmacist whether they could do this for you and whether there would be an extra charge for this.</i></p>

        <p><i>Containers are not suitable for some medications such as liquids, those that need to be kept in the fridge or those that should not be exposed to the air. Ask your pharmacist for advice.</i></p>

        <h3>4. Daily container:</h3>

        <p><i>Use any clean dry container which you can see through and which has a lid, for example, small glass or plastic jar. Label the container so you and others know what it contains.</i></p>

        <p><i>At the start of each day put the day's supply of medication into the container. Only take medication that is in your daily container and check at the end of the day that the container is empty.</i></p>

        <h2>Safe storage of medication</h2>

        <p><i>Medication can be dangerous if taken by people for whom it is not prescribed. Children are especially vulnerable as pills often look like lollies to them. So remember:</i></p>

        <ul>
          <li><i>If children visit your home, make sure that they cannot get access to medication. If you use a daily container or weekly container system, make sure this is also out of reach.</i></li>

          <li><i>If you have medication that must be kept in the fridge, keep it on the highest self and pushed well back.</i></li>

          <li><i>Make sure it is clearly labelled.</i></li>

          <li><i>Dispose of any medication that has "expired" (is beyond the use by date on the label) or you no longer need. Your pharmacist will be happy to do this for you.</i></li>

          <li><i>Never store medication in anything other than the pharmacy labelled container it came in.</i></li>

          <li><i>If the label comes off, ask the pharmacy for a new one or write out the instructions on another label or piece of paper and stick firmly onto the container.</i></li>

          <li style="list-style: none"><i>If you are using a weekly or daily container system only use it for the medication you need that day or week. Don't store medication in unused containers or sections of containers.</i></li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="definitions" id="definitions"></a>Definitions</h3>

        <p><b><i>The older person/kaumatua and the person who abuses them know each other well.</i></b></p>

        <p>Elder Abuse and Neglect occurs <b>within a relationship of trust</b>. Statistics from services in New Zealand show that the majority of abusers are members of the older person&rsquo;s family/whanau (partners, sons, daughters, in-laws, siblings, grandchildren). Other abusers include people employed in positions of trust &ndash; residential facility staff or paid carers.</p>

        <p><b>Elder Abuse</b>: Elder Abuse occurs when an older person experiences harmful physical, psychological, sexual, material/financial or social effects caused by the behaviour of another person with whom they have a relationship implying trust.</p>

        <p><b>Elder Neglect</b>: Elder Neglect occurs when an older person experiences harmful physical, psychological, sexual, material/financial or social effects caused by the behaviour of another person with whom they have a relationship implying trust.</p>

        <h3><a name="typesofabuseandneglect" id="typesofabuseandneglect"></a>Types of abuse and neglect</h3>

        <p><b><i>Several types of abuse can be present at the same time.</i></b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>PHYSICAL &ndash; Infliction of physical pain, injury or force</li>

          <li>PSYCHOLOGICAL / EMOTIONAL &ndash; Behaviour including verbal abuse which causes mental anguish, stress and fear</li>

          <li>SEXUAL &ndash; Sexually abusive and exploitative behaviours involving threats, force or the inability to give consent</li>

          <li>MATERIAL / FINANCIAL &ndash; Illegal or improper exploitation and/or use of funds or other resources</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Neglect</b> occurs as a result of another person failing to meet the physical and emotional needs of an older person/kaumatua.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>ACTIVE NEGLECT is conscious and intentional deprivation.</li>

          <li>PASSIVE NEGLECT is the result of the carer's inadequate knowledge, infirmity or lack of trust in prescribed services.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>SELF NEGLECT</b> is not dealt with here as it is not considered to be a form of elder abuse and neglect as defined above. However, it is necessary to assess whether a situation is one of neglect by others, self-neglect, or a combination of these.</p>

        <h3><a name="abuseandneglectformaori" id="abuseandneglectformaori"></a>Abuse and Neglect in Maori</h3>

        <p>Maori recognise the types of elder abuse and neglect defined here but respond to this in a way which considers the context of the four cornerstones of health &ndash; Taha Wairua (Spiritual), Taha Whanau (Family), Taha Hinengaro (Mental), Taha Tinana (Physical). In this context, definitions of abuse and neglect may also include the lack of culturally appropriate services, preventing contact with whanau and non-practice of traditional ways.</p>

        <p>In responding to elder abuse and neglect Maori promote a holistic approach involving whanau, traditional cultural values including decision making processes, and the four cornerstones of health to restore manaakitanga.</p>

        <p>While the majority of prevention services developed to date use NZ European processes, a number of Maori/iwi groups and Pacific groups are using their own processes to address the problem of elder abuse within their communities.</p>

        <h3><a name="abuseandneglectforpacificislanders" id="abuseandneglectforpacificislanders"></a>Abuse and Neglect for Pacific people and for people from other cultures</h3>

        <p>As there are many groups of Pacific peoples resident in New Zealand, all with their own language, social structures and cultural practices, it is not possible to generalise a &lsquo;Pacifica&rsquo; approach to elder abuse and neglect.</p>

        <p>While it is likely that Pacific people and people from other cultures will recognise the types of abuse and neglect defined here, it is also likely that abuse and neglect will encompass other behaviours which are considered by that cultural group as harmful to their older people. Services are being developed acknowledging peoples' rights to assistance from people of their own culture, incorporating their own values.</p>
