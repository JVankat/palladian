The potential conflict of medical costs and medical care raises thorny questions, Joseph Gerstein, a medical director at Tufts Health Plan, is one man who has to face them. 

</i><p>

</td></tr></table>

No one around the table looks happy. The case in front of the five men and five women presents exactly the kind of issue that they would prefer not to have to confront. Who would? But here it is, and a decision has to be made
today.<p> 
<p>The facts are not in dispute. A patient is suffering from a particularly virulent form of cancer. The person, who is never identified by name, has been through all the standard treatments at a major Boston teaching hospital. Unfortunately, as often happens with this type of cancer, the treatments have not slowed the disease's progress.
 Eager for a cure, the patient has learned about a clinical trial in another state, where doctors are using a new therapy that might work against the cancer. The patient wants to take a chance on the treatment - even though, by all accounts, the likelihood of success is tiny - and, what's more, she wants her health maintenance organization to pay the bill.
<p> Joseph Gerstein lays out the details of the case for his colleagues in his customary calm manner. Gerstein is a doctor, and he looks and sounds like one. He has a gray beard, large glasses, and a baritone voice that conveys authority. The men and women listening to him are a collection of medical people, administrators, and lawyers at Tufts Health Plan, a local HMO. 
hey form a committee that hears appeals from Tufts members who have been told the HMO will not pay for a particular treatment. In the course of a year, the committee will review several hundred cases.
<p>  Gerstein, who is 62, tells the group that the proposed therapy is clearly experimental and that Tufts, like all health insurers, doesn't pay for experimental procedures. There are some exceptions to the rule, but this case doesn't fit any of them. A few people on the committee ask Gerstein questions, perhaps hoping to hear something that will make their decision easier. The specific cost of the treatment never comes up. After just a few minutes, the discussion is over. It is time to decide.<p>
Despite popular perception, cases like this one are quite rare. HMOs don't routinely make life-and-death decisions. But they do make decisions every day about how medical dollars are spent. In the process, they have come under attack from patients, doctors, and politicians. They have been mentioned in the same breath as tobacco companies. They have been accused of breaking the bond between patients and doctors and of putting profits ahead of people's lives.
<p><p>In this year's emotional national debate, one charge has surfaced repeatedly: that bean counters, not doctors, are calling the shots. "Medical decisions should be made by medical doctors, not insurance company accountants," President Clinton said in his State of the Union address, in January. The line drew vigorous applause from members of both parties. 
<p><p>In fact, at Tufts, as at most other HMOs, medical decisions are made by doctors like Gerstein. He is one of nine full-time medical directors at the HMO. An HMO is a type of health insurance company that tries to trim costs by negotiating discounts with doctors and hospitals and by eliminating unnecessary medical care. From its base in Waltham, Tufts provides health insurance to 1 million people, most of them in Massachusetts. Gerstein doesn't see patients anymore. Instead, he and his colleagues oversee the care provided by the 17,000 doctors in the Tufts network. The direcresponsibility. Gerstein handles the health needs of senior citizens and deals with pharmacy issues. Other directors specialize in women's health, mental health, and pediatrics. As a group, they handle complaints from patients and doctors and try to measure and improve the quality of care. And they wrestle with the thorny, sometimes unpopular issues that get dumped in their laps.
<p><p> Should Tufts pay for Viagra, the impotence drug, and if so, how many pills per month are appropriate? How many mental health visits are enough? When is nose surgery cosmetic, and when is it a medical necessity? (Tufts will pay for the latter but not the former.) Should a patient be allowed to travel to a specialist in another part of the country for a major operation?
<p><p> Gerstein resolves such questions the way most doctors would, drawing on his medical experience and common sense. But he brings an added element to the equation: a concern for costs. For Gerstein, American medicine is like the candy you get at the movies: There is too much of it, and the price is too high. He believes costs can be whittled down without sacrificing quality. In some cases, he says, the quality can even be enhanced. Keeping a handle on costs isn't just desirable, Gerstein argues. It is critical. "If everyone says, `I paid my health insurance premium, I don't care what anything costs,' the result is the inevitable and inexorable rise in the premium," he says after the meeting. "And if you raise the premium, people will drop out at the bottom because they can't afford the insurance. We have a social obligation not to squander resources."
<p><p>Gerstein holds down costs in a variety of ways: He urges doctors to use older, cheaper drugs if they are as effective as high-priced new ones; he points out ways that expensive mistakes can be avoided; and sometimes, though not terribly often, he says no - to patients who want care that Tufts won't pay for. "We like to say yes," Gerstein explains. "We like to satisfy people. But the decisions have to be rational. We can't just do whatever anyone wants us to do." Being an HMO medical director is a bit like relief pitching. It is not a job a kid grows up dreaming about. Joe Gerstein wanted to be a doctor. A Boston boy, he spent his first 15 years in Roxbury, before his family moved to Brookline. He went to the Tufts University School of Medicine and did a residency at the old Boston City Hospital. For 10 years, he trained interns and residents for Harvard Medical School at Mt. Auburn Hospital, in Cambridge. One of his students from those days is his current boss, Dr. Harris Berman, Tufts's president. "Joe was the smartest young doctor I ever met," says Berman.
<p>  Gerstein eventually went into private practice, as a family doctor in Watertown. His former partners describe him in glowing terms. "Joe was a superb, compassionate doctor," says Dr. Alan Barron, who still practices in Watertown. "He would make a house call at 10 at night and go to the drugstore if the patient needed medicine. If they couldn't afford it, he would pay for it. Joe took care of kings and paupers."
<p><p>If Gerstein was an old-fashioned doctor in some respects, he was very unconventional in other ways. A man with a wide range of intellectual interests, Gerstein over the years has made himself an expert in pain management, medical ethics, and the treatment of alcoholism and drug abuse. He still runs a weekly class for addicted inmates at the state prison in Concord.
<p><p> In the mid-1980s, managed care showed up on Gerstein's radar screen. "I felt that if physicians didn't participate in managed care, we ought not complain about the catastrophe that would develop," he recalls. Gerstein organized the doctors at Mt. Auburn into a group that could deal with HMOs. He later became the group's first president. Impressed by his work at Mt. Auburn, Tufts Health Plan offered Gerstein a job as a part-time medical director. For a number of years, Gerstein divided his time between Tufts and his practice. In 1996, he gave up his practice for good.
<p><p> In his current job, Gerstein is back in his old role of teacher, only this time he is a teacher of managed care. Over the years, Tufts has sent him around to hospitals, including the major teaching hospitals, to show doctors how to practice more cost-efficient medicine. In the early 1990s, Gerstein did a stint at Massachusetts General Hospital. "Joe taught us you could reduce costs and do a better job," says Dr. Arlan Fuller, a cancer specialist at the hospital. One example: Gerstein showed doctors at MGH a different way to manage the pain of patients who had been through surgery. Gerstein's goal, says Fuller, was to get the patients out of the hospital sooner. "It was also appropriate care," says Fuller. "The patients felt better and got back to normal sooner."
<p><p>Gerstein's teaching style is a quirky blend of practical and professorial. He has an enormous vocabulary. In the course of conversation, he uses words like "pusillanimous," "eschew," and "tsunami." In a single meeting, he once used two separate synonyms for lying,  "dissembling" and "prevaricating." There is never a sense that he is showing off. It's the way he talks.
<p><p>One of Gerstein's favorite words is "rational." For Gerstein, rational means scientific. It means things are done logically and backed up with evidence. If you say one drug is better than another, Gerstein will ask you for the numbers to prove it. If you say one hospital practices higher-quality medicine than another, Gerstein will demand to see the evidence. His insistence on rational decisions can make him seem hard-nosed or even hard-hearted - more Mr. Spock than Dr. Spock.
<p><p> But that can be misleading. Gerstein practiced medicine long enough to know that not everything is black and white. Often, his decisions are judgment calls, based not solely on scientific evidence but on his reading of the frequently irrational nature of human behavior.
<p><p>Consider: Not long ago, Gerstein got a call from an exasperated doctor. The doctor had a patient facing prostate surgery. The man had received a first, second, and third opinion about the surgery and was still seeking more information. Because of the way the doctor was reimbursed - he received a fixed payment for each patient in his practice - all the extra visits were costing him money. The doctor wanted to know: What should I tell him? 
<p><p> Gerstein discovered that the patient was an engineer, a man who wrote four- and five-page letters to his doctor explaining what he was after. "The guy was compulsive, a perfectionist," says Gerstein. "Some people are like that. They can't help it. So I said to his doctor, `If you were driving over a bridge, would you want to know this guy helped build it?' The doctor said yes." Gerstein recommended that he let the man keep investigating his options. Says Gerstein: "That's the kind of dialogue we are looking for. We don't just want to be sitting around with rubber stamps."

Spend an hour at a meeting of Tufts's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, and you can see America's health care costs rise before your eyes.
<p>  The committee of doctors and pharmacists, which Gerstein chairs, has to approve new drugs before Tufts will pay for them. The committee members get a detailed description of each drug. There is information about the drug's safety, its effectiveness, and how it compares to existing drugs. Then there is the price tag. At the group's monthly meeting in August, the first drug up for consideration is Plavix. Like aspirin, it can be used to prevent heart attacks and strokes. A 30-day supply of aspirin costs 60 cents wholesale; a comparable supply of Plavix costs $86.75. A second drug on the agenda treats foot ulcers. The wholesale price for a single tube of gel is $378. "How do you like the price on this one," says pharmacist Dave Morgan, when the gel comes up for discussion.
<p>  Drugs are not a sexy issue in medicine. They don't get as much attention as big-ticket items like heart transplants or cancer operations. They should. More than any other factor, drug costs are driving up health insurance premiums, especially in plans that serve senior citizens. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, one of Tufts's competitors, predicted recently that by the year 2002, it would spend more money on drugs than on hospital care. Tufts currently devotes about 13 percent of its medical budget to drugs.
<p><p>Some of that money is financing important innovations in treating everything from AIDS  to arthritis. But, in Gerstein's opinion, much of it isn't. "We are paying tremendously for drugs that add virtually nothing to the health status of our members," he says, warming to a subject that can make both his voice and his blood pressure rise. Gerstein is very critical of what he calls the "promotional juggernaut" that drug companies use to sell new drugs. In talks before doctors' groups, he warns physicians to be on their guard. "I want them to be skeptical," he says. "They should not jump at any new drugs just because they are promoted by good-looking drug salesmen. You can always spot the salesmen at doctors' offices. They are physically striking people." In a newsletter that he writes, Gerstein champions the cause of inexpensive drugs. "I don't eschew the word `cheap,' he says. "I was brought up in Roxbury. I like a bargain."
<p><p>Words aren't the only club Gerstein wields. In April, at the recommendation of Gerstein's committee, Tufts put out a list of 25 drugs that it will no longer pay for. According to Gerstein, cheaper and equally good substitutes exist for every drug on the list. Exceptions were granted for people whose doctors said they had to continue using the banned drugs.
<p><p> Restricting the use of drugs can compromise the quality of care, warns Dr. William Schwartz, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California. "If you are talking about drugs that are literally equivalent, that is not a problem," he says. "But if you are using a less effective drug to save money, even if it is only 5 percent less effective, then what you are doing is rationing care."
<p><p> The Tufts list does not appear to fall into that category. "Nothing on this list is problematic," says Jerry Avornsor of medicine at the University of Southern California. "If you are talking about drugs that are literally equivalent, that is not a problem," he says. "But if you are using a less effective drug to save money, even if it is only 5 percent less effective, then what you are doing is rationing care."
<p><p> The Tufts list does not appear to fall into that category. "Nothing on this list is problematic," says Jerry Avorn, a professor at Harvard Medical School and a drug specialist, after he is read the list over the phone. "There are good substitutes for all of them."
<p><p> In some cases, Gerstein's caution about new drugs has saved more than money. Last year, his committee refused to approve a pain reliever called Duract. Gerstein argued that the drug was 70 times more expensive than Advil, an over-the-counter pain reliever, and no more effective. In June, the drug was pulled from the market because it was linked to liver damage. Tufts did approve the use of Redux, a popular weight-loss drug, that was later found to cause heart and lung damage. At Gerstein's urging, however, Redux was approved only for people who met the medical definition of "morbidly obese." The upshot: The decision saved both money and lives. "You don't hit too many home runs like that," says Gerstein. After considerable debate, Tufts OK'd the use of Viagra but said it would pay for only four pills per month. Gerstein played a key role in the decision. "I haven't heard a Viagra joke in two months," Gerstein tells the group, a sign, he says, that the "tsunami of public angst" about the drug has subsided. 
<p><p>At the meeting in August, the committee approves practically everything up for consideration. Despite his feelings about drug costs, Gerstein isn't the hard-liner here. That role falls to Dave Morgan, the owner of Home Pharmacy, in Hyde Park. He calls one drug "garbage" and describes claims for another one as "a crock." He was against the idea of Tufts paying for Viagra. "As an employer, I don't want to be paying for that," he says.
<p>  Gerstein, by contrast, comes off as more of a scientist. If the drug makers can document that their products have benefits, even small ones, he says, the drugs should be available. When the meeting is finished, Gerstein offers a post-mortem. "It's the medical-industrial complex versus the people who pay the bills," he says. "We are trying to reach some accommodation."

Gerstein has his professor's hat on this evening.<p><p>He is in a hotel room on Cape Cod, teaching a group of doctors about capitation, a practice that mixes money, medicine, and ethics in a way that makes many people nervous. Under capitation, groups of doctors are paid a flat rate for each patient they are assigned. They get the same amount of money whether the patient requires expensive medical care or no care at all. Tufts uses capitation to pay doctors in Secure Horizons, a Medicare HMO that serves 82,000 people, nearly all of them senior citizens. In other Tufts plans, doctors are paid according to a formula that blends<p> HMOs hope that capitation will allow them to reach the holy grail of health care: high quality and cost control. But the dangers of such a system are obvious. By spending less on care, doctors can keep more money for themselves. Writing in The New England Journal of Medicine, editor in chief Jerome Kassirer warned recently that, under capitation, "physicians will be forced to choose between the best interests of their patients and their own economic survival."
<p><p>Gerstein had similar worries when Tufts launched Secure Horizons in 1994 and made him the medical director for the plan. Four years later, Gerstein's two fears - "that physicians would go bust or do the wrong thing" - have not been realized. In fact, many of the doctors affiliated with Secure Horizons say the capitated arrangement has worked out surprisingly well. 
<p>  "I can't tell you how liberating it is," says Dr. Terrence O'Malley, an internist from Chelsea. (O'Malley also works part time as a doctor at The Boston Globe.) O'Malley says the doctors in his group like the autonomy that capitation provides. The doctors decide how the money they receive is to be spent, with very little interference from above. They say they do more preventive care, make more phone calls, and even make occasional house calls under capitation. The trick, they say, is to spend money up front to prevent more costly care down the road. "Joe's message is: `The most expensive care is the care that doesn't work, so get it right the first time,"' says O'Malley.
<p><p>Gerstein has come to appreciate capitation because it demonstrates what he believes: that while in the best of all possible worlds it might be nice to ignore money, in the real world, worrying about money forces people to spend it wisely.  "We've got physicians who have been in practice for 30 years who have no idea what it costs for an ambulance, an X-ray, a medication," he says. "They don't ask, because they are not paying. Once they are at risk financially, they say, `Wait a minute. I should start asking."'
<p><p>The doctors who have come to Gerstein's talk on the Cape won't even have to ask. On the wall behind Gerstein is a chart that lists medical services - hospital care, nursing home care, diagnostic tests - with prices next to each one. Gerstein focuses on one item: the $170 price tag for a consultation with a specialist. HMOs frequently are accused of blocking referrals to specialists in order to save money. Such a strategy makes no sense, according to Gerstein. He tells the doctors that money paid to specialists can be money well spent. Specialists can help diagnose a problem sooner, he explains, a plus for the patient and the bottom line. The rest of Gerstein's stories have a similar point: that a doctor working under capitation can keep a handle on costs and still do a good job for his patients.
<p><p> Jerome Kassirer isn't so sure. The New England Journal of Medicine editor is afraid of what could happen under capitation if financial pressures start to influence the decisions doctors make. "At what point do you begin to worry?" he asks. 
<p><p> Dr. Roy Berkowitz-Shelton has seen the problem up close. Berkowitz-Shelton practices in Somerville and works with Secure Horizons. Recently, he had a patient who needed a major operation. Berkowitz-Shelton's group typically sends such patients to Beth Israel Hospital. In this case, however, the patient's family wanted her to go to Massachusetts General Hospital, because a particular surgeon there was considered an expert in the surgery she needed. Berkowitz-Shelton didn't know what to do. He was afraid the operation at Mass. General would be much more expensive. Under capitation, the extra money would come straight out of his group's pocket. 
<p><p> In the end, everything worked out well. The woman went to Mass. General - the price difference turned out to be small - and the operation went smoothly. Yet, to Berkowitz-Shelton, the whole experience was troubling. "I saw that it was possible to rationalize a decision, to tell yourself that it was made for quality reasons," he says, "when in reality, finances played a role." 
<p><p>  Before reaching his decision, Berkowitz-Shelton called Gerstein. His advice? "Joe told me to let her go to Mass. General," the doctor says. "He was able to look at the human side of the problem. He said, "Listen: What happens if she goes to Beth Israel, gets the best care possible, and she dies anyway? The family is not going to be happy. They are never going to believe she got the best care. This could come back to haunt you. It's not worth the anguish you will cause everyone."'
Gerstein has to make some of his toughest calls as a member of one of Tufts's appeals committees. He refers to them as "Solomonian decisions." The committees handle complaints from people who have been told that Tufts will not pay for a treatment. There are three levels of appeals. Gerstein's group listens to second-round appeals, which means the requests have already been turned down once. "They are all sad stories," says Gerstein.
<p><p>The committee meets in a large conference room at Tufts headquarters, in Waltham. Gerstein spends as much as four hours preparing for the sessions. At a recent meeting, he showed up with two shopping bags full of papers, a collection of medical records, and letters from patients, doctors, and Tufts employees. He seems to have memorized the details of most cases. Only rarely does he need to look at his notes.
<p><p>The cases have a medical component, but the issues often revolve around interpretation of the rules. Does Tufts cover the service? Can a Tufts member see a doctor who is not part of the Tufts network? Was a visit to the emergency room justified? The sessions have more in common with a Supreme Court hearing than with an episode of ER.
<p><p>In general, Gerstein is in favor of upholding the rules. If Secure Horizons only pays for limited dental work, how can it justify paying $500 to fix a broken tooth, a procedure that clearly isn't covered? If the HMO tells people they must choose from a restricted group of doctors, how can it let a man pick a doctor outside the network for his cataract surgery? "It's not necessary that we indulge his demand," Gerstein declares to the group. "That is what he is doing, making a demand."
<p>  Sometimes, however, the facts aren't clear and a judgment call is required. In one case, a confused elderly man wound up in the emergency room because he forgot to renew his prescription. Was this really an emergency? Gerstein isn't sure. Still, he recommends that Tufts pay the bill and speak to the man later. "We will wind up paying 200 bucks for a 10-cent pill," he says, shaking his head.
<p><p> Most of the cases on the agenda involve serious but not critical medical issues. Then there is the case of the cancer patient who wants the experimental treatment. Even before there were HMOs, health insurers wrestled with the issue of experimental procedures. By definition, these are therapies whose value has not been proved. Often they are drugs that are being tested in clinical trials. All insurers specify in their contracts that they will not pay for experimental procedures. Tufts makes some exceptions. Like other HMOs, it will sometimes pay for final-stage clinical trials in experiments run by the National Cancer Institute or the National Institutes of Health.
<p>  "We are not interested in spending money on shots in the dark," says Gerstein. "We have to use our judgment." Gerstein's immediate boss, chief medical officer Philip Boulter, makes the same point. "If you decide you will cover everything, then the public needs to expect the cost of health care will rise dramatically," he says. "We are not talking about one-dollar pills. These are very expensive and risky procedures."
<p><p> At today's meeting, the experimental case turns out to be somewhat less grave than it originally appears - at least from Tufts's point of view. The patient is going to get the experimental treatment no matter what the HMO decides, presumably by paying the bill herself. So the issue before the committee is not about life and death but about money: Should Tufts pay for the treatment? Gerstein makes it clear to the group that the procedure in question is an early-stage clinical trial. He doesn't say the treatment is a "shot in the dark," but everyone seems to understand that it is. When the issue comes up for a vote, the group is in agreement: The HMO will not pay.
<p><p> Several weeks later, Gerstein offers an update. The patient went ahead and got the experimental treatment. Things did not go well. Within a short time, the patient was hospitalized. Her condition is considered terminal.
<p><p>  Gerstein is well aware of what the patient and her family were going through. When he was in practice, he dealt with death regularly. It took him 10 years as a doctor before he could look a patient in the eye and say, "You are dying." He still remembers that first case clearly. Despite that history, Gerstein is comfortable with the decision the HMO has made. "In my mind, if we had paid for this one, we would have had to OK any kind of experimental treatment in terminal patients," he says. "At some point, we have to draw the line."

In his new book, Life Without Disease, Dr. William Schwartz lays out a bittersweet vision of America's medical future. In the coming years, the University of Southern California professor predicts, scientists will find new ways to cure, or at least control, most major diseases. But progress will come with a huge price tag. New drugs and therapies, Schwartz writes, will boost the cost of medical care, creating a burden for those already straining to foot the bill. Gerstein doesn't dispute Schwartz's thesis. "I am not a seer," he says, "but I would say we are heading into another period of massive escalation of costs." 
<p> In the debate over health maintenance organizations,  many have argued that all medical decisions should be made by patients and their doctors, without interference from anyone else. Such a world might be desirable, but it probably would not be affordable, says Nancy Turnbull, a lecturer at Harvard's School of Public Health. "The problem is, neither patients nor<p>their doctors are the ones paying the bills," she says. "Without any financial constraints, there would be no limits on the care demanded." The old fee-for-service system had very few constraints; it has largely disappeared because it failed to control costs.
<p> At the other end of the spectrum are the government-run systems in countries such as Canada and England. They have held the line on costs, but they have done so by imposing limits -  long waits for specialty care and restricted access to new technology - that Americans would be unlikely to accept. "In this country, we want it all, but we don't want to pay for it," Schwartz complains.
<p> For better or worse, America has chosen a middle path, where insurance companies and HMOs have assumed a major role. That could change. Over time, coalitions of doctors and hospitals could take over many of the jobs that HMOs currently perform. Partners HealthCare System Inc., the parent company of Mass. General and Brigham and Women's Hospital, is already moving in that direction. Partners takes money from insurers and assumes responsibility for managing care for large groups of patients.
<p>  Yet no matter how the system evolves, or what name we attach to the surviving organizations, someone will have to sit at the center and help make decisions. Will we pay for Viagra? Can someone travel to another state for an operation? How many mental health visits are necessary?
<p><p>He or she will have to measure the quality of care, handle complaints, and strike a balance between what is desirable and what is affordable. Ideally, such a person would be a doctor. Hopefully, he or she would be knowledgeable in a variety of medical fields and have plenty of practical experience. This doctor would need to be both compassionate and hard-headed, willing to listen but ultimately willing to make a difficult decision. In fact, this doctor might be someone a lot like Joe Gerstein.
