      <p><strong>I live
in a
bipolar
world</strong></p>
      <p>I heard a joke this morning
that got a hearty laugh from
several people. It gave me a
chill.</p>
      <p>Someone obviously asked
        about a man who had just left.
  "He didn't take his medicine
        today," another cracked.</p>
      <p> I took my medicine today,
        so I didn't think the joke was
        funny.        </p>
      <p>And then there was the situation
        with Terrell Owens. Remember
        that? According to the
        transcript of a 911 call, he apparently
        tried to commit suicide.
        Then he denied making a
        suicide attempt.</p>
      <p> "Terrell has 25 million reasons
        to be alive," his publicist
        said. She was referring to Owens
        ' Dallas Cowboys salary. I
        doubt that any amount of money
        would stop someone who really
        wanted to commit suicide.        </p>
      <p>I am skeptical because I am
        a woman with bipolar disorder.
        You may know my condition as
        manic depression. It's considered
        a major mental illness.        </p>
      <p>What this means to me is
        that sometimes I'm painfully
        giddy with all the possibilities
        of life, and sometimes I'm depressed
        over just about everything.
        I tend to get depressed
        from November until February,
        changing to manic, or hypomanic
        - which is less than
        manic, but more euphoric than
        a normal mood - from April to
        October.</p>
      <p> Bipolar disorder can make
        life hard sometimes. Sometimes
        I honestly want to kill
        myself, which scares me and
        others around me who share my
        secret. Most of the time, I know
        when things I do are over the
        top, especially when I'm manic.
        But usually, I know this after I
        do them, after the split-second
        decision I make to act. This is
        tough, especially when I think
        back over what I've done.        </p>
      <p>Medications help a lot. </p>
      <p>But
        the list of unpleasant side effects
        are long, and I find it hard
        to fault anyone who finds the
        side effects outweigh the advantages
        of being medicated. After
        all, being manic or hypomanic
        can be really fun and incredibly
        exciting - at the time.
        But I can't talk to you about
        this essential part of my life.
        You might not understand.        </p>
      <p>You might even think that I
        am capable of hurting
        you, or going nuts on a
        moment's notice. You
        might read about another
        bipolar who did
        something shocking,
        and think I am just
        like him or her. You
        might not want to give
        me a job.        </p>
      <p>I am the face of a
        silent minority - the
        mentally ill among you. You'll
        never know how many of us
        there are because we are afraid
        of what you might think.        </p>
      <p>I am a woman with bipolar. I
        could be the person sitting next
        to you in class. I could be your
        instructor.</p>
      <p> I am anonymous for a reason.        </p>

        <strong>I can't
believe
my own
thoughts</strong>
      <p>It used to be odd for me to
think that life is a blessing.
Not that I have anything to
complain about, but still, I
have a lot to be thankful for.</p>
      <p>To begin with, I have my
        health. This was not the case for
        a very long time. I have more
        friends now than I have ever had
        and I am making progress in
        school.</p>
      <p> Mental illness is a weird
        thing. In some ways, everyone
        has it. Most people just don't
        need treatment. It is a case of degrees.</p>
      <p> For me, it is awful. My mind
        can't tell the difference between
        what I see and what I imagine. Everyone
        hears voices, sees pictures
        and has videos that play in their
        heads. Most know that it is not
        real, but my brain acts as if it is.</p>
      <p> So, you might think that these
        things never happen. I have learned
        that most people don't think about
        how they think. The problem is
        not that I hear something that is
        not there, but that I believe my
        thoughts are coming from somewhere
        other than my brain.</p>
      <p> My brain thinks that I am
        hearing something that only exists
        in my head from a source
        that is not of my own creation.
        Reality gets confused with my
        imagination.        </p>
      <p>In my case, I thought I could
        predict the future by reading newspapers.
        I saw a video in my head of
        someone shooting a well-known
        public figure during a speech.        </p>
      <p>I saw things that would disturb
        most anyone and I actually
        believed that I alone had predicted
        it.</p>
      <p> At the same time, I also believed
        that the words this person
        was saying were harmful and
        could cause people to starve.        </p>
      <p>Because I was the only one
        who had these "special powers,"
        I felt it was my duty to oppose
        him even while I felt the need to
        protect him.        </p>
      <p>I was lucky. I had become as
        delusional as one can be while
        still having the ability to know
        something was wrong.</p>
      <p> No one knew what I thought I
        had seen for six weeks until I told
        my doctor. He knew that I wasn't
        trying to get attention and that I
        really believed these
        things that I was seeing.
        He even told me that it
        was all right for me to
        worry about the wellbeing
        of this person.</p>
      <p> This is why I write.
        When I write, I have
        the ability to reason
        things out.        </p>
      <p>No, it is not odd that
        I am more thankful for
        my health today than I have ever
        been.        </p>
      <p>I know for sure that I have an
        illness, but that is not a reason to
        give up: It is a reason to dream
        big.        </p>
      <p>I am healthy. I can live my
        life with the knowledge that I
        cannot make bad things happen
        with my thoughts.</p>

      <p><strong>I check on
locks and
appliances;<br>
I've got to</strong> </p>      
      <p>I could be obsessed, or maybe I
am just realistic.</p>
      <p>Twice a night I check the
        doors to my third story apartment
        and both of my windows to
        make sure they're locked. I have
        two deadbolts on my door and I
        stick a door jam under the doorknob
        to make it extra secure.</p>
      <p> I usually unplug all the appliances
        in the kitchen and check the
        oven knobs a couple of times to
        make sure those are turned off.</p>
      <p> After I check the sink faucet, I
        lock my bedroom door, snuggle up to
        my miniature baseball bat (for protection)
        and doze off to dream land.</p>
      <p>People tell me I'm paranoid and
        obsessive-compulsive. I'm here to
        say that, for the most part, people
        are right.        </p>
      <p>Why shouldn't I be paranoid?
        People die everyday from home
        break-ins and fires.        </p>
      <p>Although I am on the third
        floor, I've been informed by sources
        that it is possible to climb onto
        patios and enter though unlocked
        patio doors, leading to crimes I
        don't even want to think about.        </p>
      <p>Remember the Lindbergh
        Baby? That kidnapping was all
        made possible because of a ladder
        and an unlocked window.
        I bet that family
        has checked the windows
        in their house every
        night since then.        </p>
      <p>What about when
        maintenance workers
        or other types of workers enter
        your house during the day when
        you're not home? They can easily
        unlock a window and enter
        through that unlocked window
        later, while you are sleeping. It
        makes me shudder.        </p>
      <p>Who likes fires? Many fires are
        easily avoided by simply unplugging
        appliances that are not being
        used. Why not unplug everything
        and ease those thoughts of being
        burned alive?        </p>
      <p>Maybe it's because my mother
        told me to lock the door constantly,
        or maybe it's all the "Court
        TV" shows I watch obsessively,
        but I think that my paranoia
        is realistic - stuff
        happens.</p>
      <p> It won't happen in my
        apartment, though.        </p>
      <p>I make sure of that.</p>

      <strong>I could do
without the
spiritual
static</strong>
      <p>I am a shoe-gazer. There. I said
        it. As a shoe-gazer, I'm a serious
        chap who spends far too much
        time thinking about things.</p>
      <p> This is nothing new. Ask anyone
        who knows me. In childhood
        photos I always had a look of concern
        or slight panic on my face. </p>
      <p>In one snapshot I am standing
        with my pre-school classmates at
        a petting zoo, surrounded by killer
        goats who were trying to eat our
        nametags and apparently had plans
        to kill us when the teachers looked
        away. At least that's my version of
        the events.</p>
      <p> When another one of these &ldquo;educational&rdquo;
        field trips resulted in my
        being pecked in the forehead by a
        three-foot tall goose, I made a decision
        to remain cautious
        and concerned at
        all times. </p>
      <p>Fearful thinking
        has not served me well over the
        years, but I remain committed to
        it. That's how I am. </p>
      <p>I'm convinced that this same
        fearful thinking contributed to a
        long bout of depression that peaked
        back when I was in my twenties. </p>
      <p>Aging, settling down and adopting
        a gregarious dog named &ldquo;Buddy&rdquo;
        have provided immeasurable
        relief.</p>
      <p> I know I live a blessed life and
        I'm thankful that I'm aware of myself.
        I've learned to make adjustments
        in my life. Others are not as
        fortunate. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Suicide is the second leading
        cause of death of college students,&rdquo;
        according to research by the American
        Psychiatric Association. </p>
      <p>There are no statistics that can
        identify the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; of depression
        and other mental illnesses. </p>
      <p>When my depression was at its
        worst, I could not leave
        my house. My head hurt
        when I was forced with
        decisions &ndash; like which
        shirt to wear. </p>
      <p>On the days I managed to leave
        the house, I was merely a visitor or
        observer as I moved through the
        world. </p>
      <p>I often got trapped in grocery
        store aisles, left to ponder dilemmas
        such as &ldquo;who the hell invented
        all of these breakfast cereals and
        do people think they need all of
        these choices?&rdquo;</p>
      <p> There I stood, with boxes towering
        over me on both sides. I was
        paralyzed, unable to make a simple
        choice. Captain Crunch and Count
        Chocula looked on in disbelief (or
        was it pity?)</p>
      <p> Depression chipped away at every
        aspect of my life. It took my
        happiness first, then my hope.
        Eventually it took the compass that
        might have helped me find my way
        back: it took my faith.</p>
      <p> Depression distanced me from
        God, the one who was always
        able to help. When the static in
        my head made it impossible for
        me to step back and call out for
        God's help, I knew that I was in
        trouble.</p>
      <p> Communicating with God had
        been a lifeline, a source of joy. </p>
      <p>My depression made it impossible
        for me to remember my source,
        my true self and my purpose.</p>
      <p> But, God is crafty. He began
        speaking to me in unlikely places.
        Bumper stickers and T-shirts read
        like modern day proverbs. The
        static became less powerful.</p>
      <p> I've learned to rely on these
        simple things. Sentence fragments
        from passersby, the conversation at
        the next table &ndash; these are all ways
        that show me we are connected
        and that God works through us
        to help each other. I am a work in
        progress. </p>
      <p>But, I still don't know why the
        world needs so many breakfast cereals.<br>

      <strong>If you think your stress and psychological issues are insurmountable, campus professionals have <br>
resources for you</strong>
      <p>College administrators
        have reported a nationwide
        rise in mental illnesses
        affecting students.
  &ldquo;North Lake College has seen
        a similar trend develop in the past
        few years,&rdquo; said Shelley Foster, a
        counselor in the Disability Services
        Office.</p>
      <p>Some of the most common
        mental health issues, said Foster,
        are depression, stress/anxiety
        disorders and substance abuse;
        learning disabilities and ADD/
        ADHD are other conditions being
        reported. </p>
      <p>The college has seen a significant
        increase in the number of
        students with Autism and Asperger's Syndrome. However, Foster
        points out that this is not necessarily
        a bad thing.</p>
      <p> Foster believes this trend partly
        indicates a decline in the stigma
        attached to the words &ldquo;disability&rdquo;
        and &ldquo;mental illness.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>&ldquo;I believe we are seeing more
        students with mental illness because
        they are choosing to come
        to college and ask for assistance,&rdquo;
        said Foster. </p>
      <p>Two years ago, North Lake
        College responded to the increase
        by hiring professional counselors
        to provide free short-term counseling.</p>
      <p> &ldquo;Colleges need to be prepared
        for a continued increase in mental
        illnesses,&rdquo; said Carole Gray,
        director of Disability Services.
        Conditions such as depression,
        anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder,
        and psychological problems
        due to traumatic brain injury
        are not uncommon on American
        campuses. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;We are beginning to see veterans
        returning from the war with
        complex psychological issues,&rdquo;
        said Gray. Students can be assured
        that the Disability Services
        Office will work closely with Veterans
        Affairs to ensure appropriate
        services and assistance to veterans
        attending college.<br>
