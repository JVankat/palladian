<blockquote>
  <p>THE contract for  the manufacture and laying of cables to connect places on the coasts of Central  and South America, as below enumerated, was signed on the 13th August, 1881,  between Mr. James A. Scrymser, President, Mr. William Gaston Hamilton,  Vice-President, representing the Central and  South American Telegraph Company of New York, and the Directors of the India Rubber Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works  Company of London. The last section of the cables, laid in accordance with this contract as subsequently  modified, was submerged, and the whole system was in perfect electrical  condition and working order, at an average distance of twelve thousand nautical  miles from the place of manufacture, on the  13th August, 1882, or exactly one year after the signing of the first  contract.</p>
  <p>The  original contract was for 2,433 nautical miles of Main, 200 N.M. of Intermediate and 43 N.M. of Shore-End cable, making a total  length of 2,726 N.M., weighing 5,627 tons. The Works Company guaranteed  that these quantities, together with 50 N.M.  of Intermediate cable, already laid between Vera Cruz and La Barilla in  the Gulf of Mexico (see Diary of  <a href="../1881USMexico/index.htm">Mexican Cable Expedition</a>), would be sufficient to properly connect the following points:&mdash;</p>
  <p><em>In the Pacific Ocean</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A point near Panama with a point near Buenaventura,  in the United States of Colombia.</p>
    <p>A point near Buenaventura with Santa  Elena Bay, in Ecuador. Santa Elena Bay with Payta, in Peru.</p>
    <p>Payta with Chorines, near Callao, in  Peru.</p>
    <p>A point near Tehuantepec, in Mexico, with a point  near San Jos&eacute;, in Guatemala.</p>
    <p>A  point near San Jos&eacute; with Culebra Bay, in Costa Rica. </p>
    </blockquote>
  <p><em>In  the Gulf of Mexico</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Vera Cruz with a point near La  Barilla.</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p><em>In the Caribbean Sea</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Port Limon, in Costa Rica, with Colon,  on the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>By  a Supplemental Agreement, dated 30th August, 1881, the destination of the cable was modified so that the points  to be connected became:&#8209;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Vera Cruz with La  Barilla.</p>
    <p>Chorillos with  Payta.</p>
    <p>Payta with Santa Elena Bay.</p>
    <p>Santa Elena Bay with a point near  Buenaventura.</p>
    <p>A point near Buenaventura with a point off Punta  Mala, in Panama Bay, and thence by a  <span class="verdana"><span class="size18">T</span></span>-piece to a point within two miles of Panama Town.</p>
    <p>The said point off Punta Mala with  Culebra Bay, in Costa Rica. Culebra Bay with a point near San Jos&eacute;, in  Guatemala.</p>
    <p>A point near San Jos&eacute;  with a point near Tehuantepec, in Mexico;</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>and for these alterations 346 N.M. of Main and 10 N.M.  of Intermediate type were added to the contract lengths, making  these amount to a total of 3,082  N.M., weighing 6,224 tons.</p>
  <p>Subsequently  7 N.M. of Intermediate Cable (30 tons) were added to the contract to enable the cable to be taken to Coatzacoalcos instead of to  La Barilla; and on the 28th December, 1881, Salinas Bay was substituted for  Culebra Bay, an additional length of 5 N.M. of  Intermediate (212 tons) being ordered for that purpose. Thus the amount of  cable finally contracted for was 3,094 N.M. (6,275  tons) of which 2,769 N.M. Were of Deep-sea, 282 N.M. of Intermediate, and 43 N.M. of Shore-End type.</p>
  <p>In addition to this, a separate arrangement was  made January 13th, 1882, by which the  Works Company undertook to connect the Town of Buenaventura with the  Landing-place at the mouth of the river by means of two cables of Intermediate  type.</p>
  <p>In order to carry out the portion of the contract  that refers to cables in the Pacific  Ocean, the s.s. &ldquo;Dacia,&rdquo; 1856 tons, and the s.s. &ldquo;Silvertown,&rdquo;   4,935 tons, made one voyage each, the s.s. &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo; 775 tons,  acting as tender throughout the expedition. </p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo;  was loaded with 826 N.  miles (1581 tons) of cable at an average  rate of 168 N.M. per day,  the highest speed on a single run into one  tank being 43 N.M. in 12  hours. The &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; took 2,370 N.M.&nbsp; (4,881  tons); and on the night of February 1st-2nd as many as 62 N.M.  were shipped into her main tank in 12  hours by a single watch of 24 men.</p>
  <p>The highest speed attained in laying was on the  Buenaventura-Pedro Gonzalez section, when between 4 p.m., May 30th, and  4 p.m., May 31st, 195 N.M.  were paid out, and between 8 and 8.30 p.m. on the latter date the cable  was running out at the rate of 10&frac12; knots.</p>
  <p>In  selecting a good bottom on which to lay these cables about 800 soundings were  taken, and the deepest water from which a specimen of the bottom was recovered  was 2,004 fathoms. The chemical, as well as the  physical character of the bottom was studied; and no trace of copper, manganese, or any other metal that would be  injurious to cable-sheathing was found. To the west of Punta Mala, near  Montuosa the difference in depth in short distances run is remarkable. From  Cape Marzo, Panama Bay, southward to Payta,  the bottom is generally deep, close up  to shore. From Payta to Chorillos, except in the neighbourhood of Payta  and Lobos de Afuera, the bottom is an easy and gradual slope. North of a line  drawn between Pi&ntilde;as Point and Yguana Island, Panama Bay is comparatively  shallow; on that line, however, and south of it, there is a very sudden descent. From Punta Mala to Punta Elena, near San Juan del Sur, the bottom is of much the same  nature as that to southward of  Panama, but from that point north-westward the bottom is easy in depth  and soft in nature.</p>
  <p>The  s.s. &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; left the Silvertown works for Greenhithe November 15th, 1881, loaded with 772 N.M.  Deep-sea, 43 N.M.  Intermediate, and 11 N.M. Shore-End&mdash;in  all 826 nautical miles of cable, weighing 1581 tons&mdash;and having on board Mr. Wm. Falconer King, Engineer-in-charge, with  a staff of 10 cable-engineers and electricians, 11 ship&rsquo;s-officers and engineers, 30 cable-hands, and a crew of 62 men,  together with Mr. Angus Kelly, representing Mr. J.B. Stearns, the engineer  and general manager of the Central and South  American Telegraph Company, making a total of 115 men.</p>
  <p>At Greenhithe the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; took in a  quantity of cable-gear, stores, and provisions, and sailed thence for Madeira  at daybreak November 19th.</p>
  <p>Encountering  bad weather in the Channel, she put in to Plymouth November 21st; but proceeded  on her voyage November 23rd, and after a rough passage across the Bay arrived  safely off Funchal Dec. 1st. There she took in coals, water, and fresh  provisions, and. sailed again the same day for Rio de Janeiro.</p>
  <p>All  having gone well, she came to anchor in Rio harbour December 19th; renewed her  supply of coals and water, and sailed again the same day for Lota.</p>
  <p>Passing through the Straits of  Magellan and Smyth&rsquo;s Channel, the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; arrived at Lota  January 8th, 1882, after a passage of 46 days from Plymouth, and 50 days from London. There she filled up with coal,  and proceeded on her voyage January 10th.</p>
  <p>Having  called for orders at Valparaiso, she reached Callao January 18th, and found the  s.s. &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;&mdash;the West Coast of America Company&rsquo;s repairing ship, chartered by the Silvertown Company&mdash;awaiting  her arrival, with Mr. E.W. Parson&eacute;, Engineer and General Manager of the West  Coast of America Telegraph Company, acting on board as Engineer-in-charge.</p>
  <p>A brief summary, with dates, of the  work performed during the expedition will serve as an index to the  portions of the &ldquo;General Log&rdquo; given herewith which describe in  detail the laying of the cables from Chorillos, near Lima, Peru, to Salina  Cruz, Mexico.</p>
  <p>After taking soundings off Chorillos, the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  sailed  January 21st, to survey the proposed line of  the cable to Payta, where she arrived January 25th, having taken 115  soundings <em>en route.</em></p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; landed and  buoyed the Chorillos Shore-End January 24th,  and joined the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; at Payta January 27th. Here the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; landed and buoyed two  Shore-Ends in False Bay&mdash;the northern January 29th, and the southern  January 30th.</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; took soundings off  Payta and proceeded January 30th surveying the line to Santa Elena,  where both ships came to anchor January 31st.  There the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; laid and buoyed the northern Shore-End February 3rd, and landing the southern  end February 5th, she proceeded towards Payta, paying out cable, the  &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo; in company, sounding  as required.</p>
  <p>On February 7th the buoyed end was picked up in  False Bay, and the Payta-Santa Elena section was completed.</p>
  <p>At  Payta Messrs. Theophilus Smith, Rippon, and O&rsquo;Brien, with 7 cable-hands, joined the &ldquo;Dacia,&rdquo; having  left the s.s. &ldquo;International&rdquo; upon completion of the Vera Cruz-Coatzacoalcos section (see Diary of <em>C. &amp; </em>S.A. Expedition, Atlantic side.)</p>
  <p>The buoyed southern end was picked up February 9th, and  the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo;  proceeded towards Chorillos laying cable, the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo;  in  company, sounding as required. When 226 miles  had been paid out a fault appeared,  necessitating the picking up of 11 miles. The fault having been  recovered in that length, a splice was made and laying resumed. The final bight was slipped off Chorillos February 14th, and the  two ships came to anchor at Callao whence, after transferring all her spare cable to the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo;  the  &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; sailed for Valparaiso February 20th in search of a  home cargo.</p>
  <p>Messrs.  Rymer Jones and Cann had been stationed at Santa Elena, Messrs. Rippon and  Herbert Webb at Payta, Messrs. John Gray and Hawkins, with 5 cable-hands, had  joined the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; for sounding duty, and Messrs. King, March Webb, O&rsquo;Brien, and Balkwill, had left at  Callao for Lima; Messrs. Daley and Belam, with 30 cable-hands, proceeded in charge of Mr. Theophilus Smith as far  as Talcahuano in the &ldquo;Dacia,&rdquo; where they landed to  await the arrival of the &ldquo;Silvertown.&quot;</p>
  <p>After  some delay in procuring a cargo, the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; sailed from Lota March 23rd, and calling for coals at Bahia and  Madeira reached Liverpool May 22nd, discharged her cargo, and proceeding  to London May 27th was safely moored off the Works at Silvertown, June 1st,  1883, having been absent 198 days.</p>
  <p>Meantime the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo; in charge of  Mr. E.W. Parson&eacute;, and having on board the chemist of the expedition,  Mr. Geo. Darling, sailing from Callao, February 25th, made a preliminary survey  of the proposed routes and landing places as far as Salina Cruz. During this  survey 324 soundings were taken, and the  landing places at Salina Bay, San Jos&eacute; de Guatemala, and Salina Cruz  were examined. Mr. Parson&eacute; strongly reported to Mr. Scrymser, President of the  Central and South American Telegraph Company, against landing at Salinas Bay,  Nicaragua (see pp. 59-60), and in consequence of this report the cable was subsequently  landed at San Juan del Sur instead of at Salinas Bay.</p>
  <p>On her return voyage news was received at Panama  that the West Coast Company&rsquo;s Mollendo-Chorillos section was  interrupted, and the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  had to hasten back to Callao without waiting to take supplementary soundings  and examine the landings at Buenaventura as had  been intended. She reached Callao April 18th, and proceeded at once to  repair the Mollendo-Chorillos section.</p>
  <p>The s.s. &ldquo;Silvertown,&rdquo;  Mr. M.H. Gray,  Engineer-in-charge, and having on board Mr. W.F. Stearns, representing  Mr. J.B. Stearns, the Engineer and General Manager of the Central and South  American Telegraph Company, sailed from Gravesend, February 28th, 1882, but a gale blowing in the Channel, she anchored in  Margate Roads, and did not get under  weigh again till March 3rd. Calling for coal at Madeira and St. Vincent, she passed through the Straits  of Magellan, and reached Lota, April  24th, after a passage of 52 days from Weymouth. At Lota Mr. King, who had left Lima on account of  ill-health, and Mr. Theophilus Smith,  with the 3 members of the staff and 30 cable-hands, landed from the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; on the 23rd  March, joined the ship. After filling up with coal and taking on board a  quantity of cable-gear left by the &ldquo;Dacia,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  sailed for Callao, and anchored there  May 6th.</p>
  <p>At Callao, Mr. Theophilus Smith left  the &ldquo;Silvertown,&rdquo;  and proceeded  by mail steamers, via Panama, where he was joined by Mr. J. Rymer Jones,  to Kingston, Jamaica, to meet the &ldquo;International,&rdquo; and take charge of  the Mexican Extension Expedition.</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; returned from the Mollendo-Chorillos repair,  and went into dry dock at Callao, May 11th. The &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  sailed  northwards the same day, and on arriving off  the cable-hut at Payta, May 13th,  immediately started grappling for the Payta-Santa Elena cable for the  purpose of substituting Intermediate for Deep-sea cable as far as the hundred fathom line, the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo;  having run short of the former  type.</p>
  <p>Mr. Robert Kaye Gray, who had come  out via Panama, joined the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  at Payta, and took charge of the expedition from that point.</p>
  <p>After inserting a sufficient amount of  Intermediate cable at Payta, the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  proceeded, May  14th, to Santa Elena, where a similar  operation was performed, and the Payta-Santa Elena section completed, May 17th. The buoy left by &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo;  on the northern Shore-End having got adrift, the steam launch  grappled, under-ran, and buoyed this end, May 18th.</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; arrived  from Callao next day, and the two ships were occupied until May 22nd transferring cable. The &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  then spliced on to buoyed Shore-End and started paying out  towards Buenaventura, the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo; in company, sounding as  required.</p>
  <p>On  May 25th, Deep-sea cable was cut and buoyed; and a suitable landing-place  having been selected, the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; landed the Southern Shore-End (Intermed. type) at Malaga, and laying  Intermediate out to the buoyed Deep-sea end completed the Santa  Elena-Buenaventura section, May 27th. Mr. J.B. Stearns, Engineer and General Manager of the Central and South  American Telegraph Company, joined the expedition at Buenaventura on the 27th May to  represent that Company during the operations.</p>
  <p>The northern Shore-End was laid by the  &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo; May 29th, and the  &ldquo;Silvertown,&rdquo;  having spliced on, paid out as far as Cape Marzo, where  she buoyed Deep-sea cable, May 31st, and proceeded, with the  &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo; to make a minute survey with a view to finding the most suitable route to Panama. As a result of this  survey, the proposed <span class="verdana"><span class="size18">T</span></span>-piece off Punta Mala was abandoned in favour of  landing three Shore-Ends at one of the Pearl Islands.</p>
  <p>On the 8th June the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  landed the Shore-End of the  Buenaventura Section at Pedro Gonzalez Island, and after laying and buoying  Intermediate cable, proceeded to the Deep-sea end buoyed off Cape Marzo, where  she spliced on and laid back to the buoyed Intermediate end, completing the Buenaventura-Pedro Gonzalez Section, June  11th. After calling at Pedro Gonzalez to test, the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;   anchored in Panama Roads, June 12th, but shifted her berth again the same day  to the coaling station at Taboga Island.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  landed two Shore-Ends at Pedro Gonzalez, one towards Panama and one  towards San Juan del Sur, and took soundings  between Pedro Gonzalez and Panama. On June 15th she landed the Shore-End  at Panama and then joined the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  at Taboga. After taking in coal there, the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  picked up the &ldquo;Retriever&rsquo;s&rdquo;  end buoyed off  Panama and laid the main (Intermediate) cable  towards Pedro Gonzalez, completing that section, June 21st. While the  expedition was at Panama it had been arranged, after correspondence with Mr. Scrymser, that San Juan del Sur,  in Nicaragua, should be substituted, as a landing-place, for Salinas Bay  in Costa Rica.</p>
  <p>The two ships sailed. June 24th, for San Juan del Sur, taking supplementary soundings <em>en route. </em>On arriving there, June 28th, the Shore-Ends were transferred to the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo; and laid by her next day. Ten knots of Shore-End were  then paid out by the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  along the coast and picked up at  once by the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo;  and eighteen knots of Intermediate were turned over from one tank to another on board  the &ldquo;Silvertown,&rdquo;  preparatory to laying the section from San Juan  towards San Jos&eacute; de Guatemala.</p>
  <p>On July 2nd the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  started laying this  section, and buoyed . the Deep-sea end next  day some forty miles off La Libertad del Salvador, it being still undecided by the C. &amp; S.A. Co. whether the  cable should be landed there, or at San Jos&eacute; de Guatemala. After  inspecting both those Ports the two ships proceeded to Salina Cruz and anchored there, July 8th. While at Salina Cruz Mr. R.K.  Gray and Mr. J.B. Stearns  corresponded by telegraph with Mr. Scrymser, the President of the  Central and South American Telegraph Company, who was in New York. Mr. Scrymser ordered La Libertad to be  selected as a landing-place in lieu of San Jos&eacute; de Guatemala.</p>
  <p>The  Shore-End at Salina Cruz was laid by the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo;  July 10th:  the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; spliced on and started paying out towards La  Libertad, July 12th. The Deep-sea was cut  and buoyed off that Port, July 16th. The &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  landed  the Northern Shore-End the same day, and the Southern  Shore-End, July 17th. The &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; picked up the Northern  Shore-End and laid out to the end of the Deep-sea, slipping the final bight of the  La Libertad-Salina Cruz section, July 18th.</p>
  <p>On July 20th the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  picked up  the Southern Shore End,  and paid  out to the Deep-sea End, which had been buoyed July 3rd, slipping the final bight of the San Juan del  Sur-La Libertad section, July 21st.  She then proceeded to join the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  at San Juan del Sur (July 23rd), where she at once spliced on  to the buoyed Southern Shore-End;  but a series of accidents delayed the start on the Pedro Gonzalez-San Juan section until July 25th.  When 196 miles had been paid out  (July 27th), a fault appeared 131 miles astern, and it was decided to  buoy the cable, proceed to Pedro Gonzalez, and lay northwards towards this  buoy.</p>
  <p>The  &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  Company&rsquo;s available staff being greatly reduced in number owing to manning two ships and keeping two  electricians at each landing-place of the completed cables, some  difficulty was experienced in selecting a thoroughly competent electrician to  take Charge of the Pedro Gonzalez hut. This was overcome by Mr.  Parson&eacute;, who kindly volunteered to undertake the duties. He had for one  of his assistants Mr. Norton of the  Central and South American Telegraph Company&rsquo;s staff, who took duty there with  Mr. Stearns&rsquo; permission.</p>
  <p>Both ships arrived off Panama July 30th, and,  having taken in coal and water,  proceeded to Pedro Gonzalez August 3rd, where the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  picked up the Shore-End, and, laying northwards to the Deep-sea End,  buoyed July 27th, slipped the bight of the Pedro Gonzalez-San Juan del Sur section August 7th. The &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;   then picked up 10 miles of Deep-sea  cable, paid out by the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  along the coast, and  sailed August 8th for San Juan del Sur to repair a fault  which had appeared near the final bight of the San Juan-La Libertad  section. The &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  grappled the Pedro Gonzales-San Juan del  Sur section at the locality of the fault which had appeared July 27th, and, having recovered this fault,  completed that section August 10th.  After putting in to San Juan (August 11th) to ascertain that the tests of the Pedro Gonzalez-San Juan  section were now perfect, the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  proceeded to Panama, and anchored there August 17th.</p>
  <p>Meantime the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  had repaired  the fault near the original bight of  the San Juan-La Libertad section August 13th; but on returning to La Libertad had found a fresh fault in this  cable. Proceeding at once to San Juan,  she remained at anchor there until August 19th, when, having communicated with Mr. Robert Gray at Panama, Mr. King sailed again in the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  to  repair the second fault in the San Juan-La Libertad section. This was  successfully effected August 21st, and  the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo;  having ascertained at San Juan that the cable  was now perfect, proceeded, according to instructions, direct to Buenaventura. Arriving there August 27th, she was  at once recalled to Panama, where she  anchored alongside the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  August 30th.</p>
  <p>The two cables for the Buenaventura River were then  transferred from the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  to the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;; and the latter ship, having renewed  her supply of coal and water, sailed September 5th to lay a double line  of cable in the river between the hut at Malaga Point and the town of Buenaventura. This work was  successfully accomplished on  September 10th, but owing to her being short of Intermediate type of cable, Mr. King was obliged to lay 10 miles of  Main type in the Southern River  cable. On completing this the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  sailed from Buenaventura for Santa Elena to repair  the Payta-Santa Elena section, which had broken down during an earthquake on  the 15th September; and Mr. Parson&eacute;,  who by this time was on his way south  to resume his duties as Engineer and General Manager of the West Coast of America Co.&rsquo;s Cables, was stopped by  telegram at Guayaquil, and asked to take charge of this repair.</p>
  <p>Mr. Parson&eacute; grappled the cable off C. Blanco  September 30th, and the repair was completed October 3rd. The &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  called at Payta to ascertain that the electrical condition of  the cable was now perfect, and then sailing for Callao was re-delivered to the  West Coast of America Telegraph Company at that port October 10th, 1882, having  been in the service of the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  Company for 245 days.</p>
  <p>The first detachment of the cable staff had started  on the return voyage to England on September 5th, 1882, when Messrs. M.H. Gray, J.K. Gray, H.M. Walter, G. Bailey, J. Mathieson, and 37 cable-hands left the s.s. &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  at Panama,  and, crossing by rail to Colon, sailed thence in the R.M.S. &ldquo;Nile&rdquo;to Southampton, where they arrived September 29th.</p>
  <p>The  second detachment, consisting of Messrs. R. Balkwill and C.N. Evers (who had left Buenaventura upon completion  of the River-cables), Mr. L.M. D. Campbell, and 18 cable-hands,  followed by the same route in R.M.S.  &ldquo;Don,&rdquo; sailing from Colon September 18th.</p>
  <p>The s.s. &ldquo;Silvertown,&rdquo;  having taken in  coals at Taboga, weighed anchor September 12th, and, after laying 42  miles of spare cable in the Bay of Panama, landed the remaining members of the  staff and cable-hands, and sailed for San  Francisco September 13th. Calling at San Juan del Sur and Salina Cruz  for orders, and at Acapulco for coal, she arrived  at San Francisco October 15th, was docked and loaded with grain there,  and sailed again for Hull November 17th.</p>
  <p>On  her home voyage the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  called at Panama December 4th,  took in coal at Taboga, and sailed again for Lota December 9th. Arriving there December 26th, she transferred 22 N.M.  of cable to the s.s. &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  for the West Coast of  America Company, filled up with coal,  and proceeded on her voyage January 4th, 1883. The &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  arrived at St. Vincent,  Cape de Verd Islands, February 10th,  took in coal, and sailed February 14th for Grimsby, where she came to anchor March 3rd. After discharging her  cargo at Hull, the s.s. &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  sailed thence for  London March 21st, and was safely moored in  the Victoria Docks March 24th, 1883, after a voyage of 392 days.</p>
  <p>On  the 28th of September, 1882, Mr. R.K. Gray, accompanied by Messrs. W.F. King and W.F. O&rsquo;Brien, left Panama  and sailed from Colon for New York to  negotiate settlement of contract with Mr. Scrymser, the President of the  Central and South American Telegraph Company.</p>
  <p>In this settlement between Mr. Scrymser and Mr.  Robert Gray, it was agreed that the  42 nautical miles of Main type cable lying in Panama Bay should remain the property of the Silvertown Company, and that the Silvertown Company should, within a  reasonable time, after the demand of the Central and South American  Company, replace with Intermediate type the 10 miles of Main type laid in the  Southern Buenaventura River cable.</p>
  <p>The  Pedro-Gonzalez San Juan Section was interrupted by an earthquake in the  vicinity of Punta Mala, in February 1883, and in order to carry out the repair  the Central and South American Telegraph Company hired the  repairing steamer &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  from the West Coast of America  Telegraph Company, and bought the 42 miles lying in Panama Bay. The Silvertown Company, on the 24th August  1883, sent out to Callao in an iron tank fitted up on board the sailing  vessel &ldquo;Amelia Ross,&rdquo; 12 miles of Intermediate type to replace the  10 miles Main type laid in the Buenaventura  River cable. At Callao the cable is to be transferred to the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo;  which has been hired from the  West Coast of America Telegraph Company to carry out the substitution.  By special agreement, the work is to be  superintended by Mr. E.W. Parson&eacute;, Engineer and General Manager of the  West Coast of America Telegraph Company.</p>
  <p>In accordance with instructions issued by Mr. R.K. Gray, the members of his staff stationed along the Line from  Chorillos to Salina Cruz handed over the sections that had been left in their  charge to the representatives of the Central and South American Telegraph  Company on the 28th September 1882, and left their several stations for  England.</p>
  <p>Mr.  E. March Webb remained at San Juan del Sur to represent the Works Company on the Coast until the settlement  above referred to was effected between Messrs. Scrymser and Robert Gray  in New York. He sailed from San Juan del  Sur, October 26th, and returning via Panama and St. Thomas arrived in  London, November 28th, 1882.</p>
  <p>Messrs.  J. Rippon and H.P. Daley sailed from Callao, October 12th, and were joined at  Panama by Mr. A.E. Gilbert from Santa Elena, who returned with them via  Jamaica and St. Thomas to Southampton.</p>
  <p>Mr. H.L. Webb left Payta October 8th, and  proceeded via the Isthmus of Panama to New York, whence he returned with  Mr. W.F. O&rsquo;Brien to Liverpool.</p>
  <p>Messrs.  G.H. Darling and J.T. Belam left San Juan del Sur, October 1st, and returned  via Panama, Colon, Jamaica, and St. Thomas to Southampton.</p>
  <p>Messrs.  H.E. Cann and E. Stallibrass sailed from La Libertad del Salvador October 6th, and returned via the Isthmus  of Panama and New York to Liverpool.</p>
  <p>Messrs.  W.S. Seaton and C. Bright, leaving Salina Cruz September 29th, rode across the isthmus of Tehuantepec to  Coatzacoalcos, and sailing thence to Vera Cruz and New Orleans, returned  via the United States to England.</p>
  <p>Mr. W.F. King  sailed from New York for Liverpool November 21st. Mr. Robert Kaye Gray remained in New York until January 17th, and  landed at Liverpool, January 27th, 1883.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="size18">NOTE ON THE SURVEY MADE BY s.s. &ldquo;RETRIEVER.&rdquo;</span><br />
    <span class="size12">[pages 56-60]</span></p>
  <hr width="50" />
  The  s.s. &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; sailed from Callao, February 25th, to survey the proposed lines and  landing-places from Santa Elena (Ecuador) to Salina Cruz (Mexico). Mr. E.W.  Parson&eacute; was in charge of the expedition, and was assisted by Messrs. J.K. Gray, G.A.  Darling, C. Hawkins and cable-hands, G. Garvie, J. Brown, C. Jackson, and H.  Grimes. 
  <p>The &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  reached Panama March l0th, having taken 107 soundings en route; and sailed  again, March 13th, for Salina Cruz, where she arrived, March the  26th, after having taken 152 soundings and examined the landing-places  at Salinas Bay (Costa Rica) and San Jose de Guatemala. </p>
  <p>Leaving Salina Cruz, March  29th, she took 65 supplementary soundings, and got back to Panama, April 6th. There news was  received of  the  interruption of the West Coast of America Company&rsquo;s Mollendo-Chorillos section on the night  of March 10th-11th, in consequence of which Mr. Parson&eacute; had to abandon the remainder of his  programme,  and  take the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; back at once to Callao, where she arrived, April i8th, after an absence of  52 days from that port. </p>
  <p>The  soundings taken during this survey are included in the Table of Soundings given in the Appendix. Mr. George A.  Darling accompanied the expedition as chemist and analysed all specimens of  the bottom.  These were found to consist  of silicate of alumina, silica or sand, with small quantities of organic  matter, oxide of iron, lime, and magnesia. No manganese, copper, magnetic  oxide of iron, or other substance chemically injurious to cable-sheathing was found in any of  them. </p>
  <p>But the analyses and  observations made during this expedition were less numerous and complete than  had been intended, owing to three misfortunes. In the first place, the case containing all  Mr. Darling&rsquo;s  apparatus,  reagents, &amp;c., was lost overboard by the Pacific Steam Navigation Company whilst being  discharged from their ship in Callao Bay, and the contents were very much  damaged before the case was recovered by divers. In the second place, Mr. Welsford, of the  Central and  South  American Co., after announcing to Mr. Parson&eacute; his intention of joining him at Panama, <em>assumed </em>that the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; would call  at Buenaventura on her voyage  northward, and went thither to meet her, carrying with him, doubtless in  good part but <em>officiously, </em>the &ldquo;Retriever&rsquo;s&rdquo; mail and a case of instruments  (deep-sea thermometers, &amp;c.), the property of the Silvertown Company.  Lastly, the interruption of the West Coast Company&rsquo;s  Mollendo-Chorillos section prevented the more detailed survey of the  Buenaventura-Panama section (where deep water had  been encountered), and the examination of  the landing-places at the mouth of the river and at the town of Buenaventura, all of  which work was to have been  performed on the voyage south. </p>
  <p>The following extracts from  letters and telegrams give concisely the results  of the survey:&mdash; </p>
  <p>No. I. LETTER from Mr. Parson&eacute;, s.s. &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo;  Panama, April 6th, 1882, to Mr. R.K. Gray, Panama. To await his  arrival. </p>

    <p>We arrived here yesterday  morning, Thursday 6th, direct from Salina Cruz,  sounding some portions of the proposed line en route. </p>
    <p>You will find some letters for you at the British  Consul&rsquo;s (Senor March), Panama, where I have also left a tracing of  soundings in Panama Bay. I also wrote you, addressing Lima, making sure you  would have passed through by this time.  You had better also enquire at B. Consul&rsquo;s, Colon, for letters. </p>
    <p>At Salina Cruz I met with Mr.  Mayo, who is  building the land line across the Isthmus, and  your brother Jack, myself, and Darling, accompanied him to Tehuantepec. At this place I was handed  several telegrams from Mr.  Scrymser embodying following questions:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Please wire Mr. Scrymser&mdash;The  bottom on the whole line of the proposed system of cables between Chorillos and Salina  Cruz could not  be better for the cable to rest on; no rock of any kind being found.</p>
    <p>Except the two sections laid the soundings for the Shore-ends and &nbsp;Intermediate Cables have not been completed.- </p>
    <p>Three  hundred fathoms and over are easily obtainable. Soundings &nbsp;north of Panama quite satisfactory. </p>
    <p>Landing  places at Salinas Bay and San Jose have so far been &nbsp;adopted as per proposal. Intermediate soundings off Buenaventura &nbsp;not yet fixed; we complete work returning south. </p>
    <p>Sail  to-morrow morning, calling Panama. </p>
    <p>For  your information I may tell you that I think the l00-fathom line is going to prove a serious  difficulty. </p>
    <p>Off Buenaventura (outside  landing) it may be found within required distance, as also at T-piece  (Point Mala) and at Salina Cruz. On proposed spot of T-piece there is 141  fathoms, but between this and Panama landing place I do not believe there is a sounding to be  had over 80  fathoms,  and this is in a distance of 95 knots. Off Salinas Bay and off San Jose the 100 fathoms does not present itself  for a long way off shore. The deep-sea portions of the two northern  sections, i.e., Salina Cruz&mdash;San Jose&mdash;Salinas Bay, is hardly up to 300 fathoms for some miles outside proposed line;  but better water, both for depth and nature of bottom, could not possibly be desired. The only  other feature of the soundings I need note at present is the very deep water  encountered  between  Buenaventura and Point Mala, reaching 2,004 fathoms in the middle of Panama Gulf. This is  the deepest cast we have had, but we also had deep water between Point Mala and Salinas Bay,  especially in  the  first (south) part of the section. </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Parson&eacute;&rsquo;s chart received  this forenoon shows Buenaventura-Panama section deep water notably  between Cape Corrientes, Latitude Five Thirty, and Cape Marzo,  Latitude Seven. From Cape Marzo straight across to Punta Mala we have two  thousand fathoms. Ten miles west Cape Solano eighteen hundred no bottom found. This section  will require special care selecting  route. As Stearns will probably not be aboard Walter Stearns will  require full power. I cannot accept responsibility choosing route alone  in face of apparent difficulties. Shall I telegraph Scrymser. Stearns  being at present in New York could consult with Scrymser on matter. </p>

  <p>No. 4.  LETTER from  Mr. Parson&eacute; to Mr. Scrymser regarding the unfitness of Salinas Bay for a  Telegraph Station. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>s.s. &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; at Sea,<br />
      10th April, 1882. </p>
    <p>James  A. Scrymser, Esq.,<br />
      President, </p>
    <p>Central &amp; South American  Tel. Coy., 55 Broadway, New-York. </p>
    <p>Dear Sir,--On my arrival at  Panama from Salina Cruz I had the unexpected pleasure  of again meeting Mr. de Sabla, Vice-President  of your Company, and in the course of  conversation, the desirability of Salinas Bay as a point at which your cables should touch,  was referred to.  He also read me a telegram from you stating that I had approved of the situation. As a <em>landing place</em> for the cable my opinion is that there is not a better on  the coast, and this is what I intended to infer  in my reply to you from Tehuantepec, i.e., &nbsp;&ldquo;Landing places at Salinas Bay and San Jose have <em>so far</em> been adopted as per proposal.&rdquo; This, however, it appears, is  not the only question to be considered, but they  may be comprised thus:&mdash;</p>
    <p>1st. Is  Salinas Bay a suitable place to land cables? </p>
    <p>2nd. Is Salinas Bay a desirable  locality to establish a Telegraph  station?</p>
    <p>3rd. Is it to the interests of  the Company that this spot should be chosen? </p>
    <p>The  first of these questions I have already taken upon myself without hesitation to answer in the affirmative. </p>
    <p>As a  locality for a Telegraph Station, or residence of any kind, I am not of the same opinion, in  fact there is not a single feature in the place to recommend it for this purpose;  one lands on a sound pebbly beach,
      fringed with thick tropical foliage to the water&rsquo;s edge,  not such growth as  is generally found near the coast even in the tropics, but a virgin forest of full grown  trees. Animal life is abundant in the shape of monkeys and parrots, and the  ground swarms with large black ants and small  shelled fish. A clearing would have to be  made to erect even a small house, and the shallow percolating brooks which run into  the Bay must render  any foundation very damp. There is no settlement here, but on proceeding three or four  miles towards the head of the Bay we fell in with a party of very primitive travelling fishermen  drying fish for sale in the interior; from questions I put to these people they  gave me to understand  the place was quite healthy, but I should be loath to place great weight, or faith,  in this opinion. One fisherman there is who appears to be a resident having a house at the head of the  Bay, he told me  no steamers or crafts of any kind ever call; altogether, the impression left after a short visit such as we made leaves me  with the idea that the place could not well be more out of the world or  furnished with less resources. </p>
    <p> Touching Company&rsquo;s interests or obligations, it would be presumption on my part to enquire,  or advise, but had I at the time of visiting this part of the coast had any  idea that there was any doubt about, or that the  Salinas Bay landing was not definitely settled, I should have considered it part of my programme to have gone to San Juan del Sur  and reported on its advantages  over the place in question. </p>
    <p>I think no objection can be  found to San Jose, which appears to be quite a centre; both this place and Salina Cruz are  reported by the foreign  residents to be very healthy, they are very open and liable to heavy surf, and although there may be considerable  difficulty in landing the shore-ends, the cables once on shore will  be excellently located. </p>
    <p class="right">I remain,<br />
      Dear Sir, <br />
      Yours very obediently, <br />
      E.W. Parson&eacute;. </p>

  <p class="center">THE ISLAND OF PEDRO  GONZALEZ.</p>
  
  <p>JAMES A. SCRYMSER,  ESQ.,<br />
    President, <br />
    Central and South  American Tel. Coy.,<br />
    37 Wall Street, City. </p>
  <p>Dear Sir, </p>
  <p>I give you an extract from a letter written by Mr. E. W. Parson&eacute;, after a ten days&rsquo; stay on the Island  of Pedro Gonzalez, and which may be of interest to you. In re  arranging my papers to-day I found the letter among them. </p>
  <p>Under date of Panama, Aug. 17th, 1882, Parson&eacute;  says:&mdash;&quot;Before going on shore at the landing place, where  the hut was erected, we made a tour of the Island in the &lsquo;Retriever.&rsquo; We  stopped the vessel and landed at three points on the East side of the  Island at which a few huts on shore  showed the presence of inhabitants. However, it was only at the last that we were able to make any  arrangements for assistance and provisions. The head-man here is a negro named Cavallero, and  he promised to send us the men we  required and what provisions he could spare. In accordance with Mr. J. B. Stearns&rsquo;  request I tried to arrange with him for watchmen to look after the hut, etc.,  and after some difficulty it was ultimately settled that two men  should take this charge and receive four dollars per month for the  performance of this duty. On  landing at the hut I found all the instruments, etc., intact; we also discovered  good fresh water flowing on to the beach about 150 yards south of  the hut. The three shore-ends were well buried. I consider it very  necessary, if any work is to be done from this place or watches kept,  that a permanent house be built: say after the native fashion, that is,  on piles with a good deck some feet above the ground. A tent is not  sufficient protection from the frequent heavy rains. This house could be  built by the natives. I was unable to make them understand the  nature of a contract for this class of work, but they are perfectly willing to work for day wages. </p>
  
  
  
  
  &ldquo;With the exception of Cavallero, who sets out the work of  planting for the others, and collects the  rents for the proprietor, the natives are not altogether to be trusted.  However, the two employes of the Central and South American Coy., Messrs.  Norton and Phillips, who were with me, can  give Mr. Stearns information on this particular. The proprietor of the  island resides in Panama.&rdquo;
  <p>I send you the above as it may be useful to you and Mr.  France. I do not know whether the arrangement as to watchmen is at present being carried out or not. I may also mention that  in making the arrangement for the landing place at Panama we erected our  hut on a squatter&rsquo;s lot, and I promised the woman who occupies the lot 3  dollars per month, as rent for the ground  taken from her, and on condition that  she looked after the hut. This latter agreement Mr. Stearns endorsed  when I informed him of it.</p>

  <p class="center">THE  LAND LINE ACROSS THE ISTHMUS OF TEHUANTEPEC.</p>
  <hr width="150" />
  <p class="center"><em>Extract from a  Letter from </em>Mr. W.S. SEATON <em>to </em>Mr. R.K. GRAY.</p>
  <hr width="150" />
  <p align="left">Starting from  Salina Cruz Station, the Line for about a mile runs in a direction parallel with the beach over open  ground, and then joins the road from the port to the town of  Tehuantepec. With the exception of about half  a mile near Zuleta Ranch, the whole of this road lies through forest  until within the immediate vicinity of Santa Maria, a suburb of Tehuantepec,  situated on the right bank of the river. The Tehuantepec river is easily spanned  by the Line, and presents no obstruction to the linesman; for it is generally fordable, and there are plenty of canoes  plying between Tehuantepec and Santa Maria during the rainy season, when the  river is high.</p>
  <p align="left">From the town of Tehuantepec,  which is some 14 miles from the  Salina Cruz Station, the Line continues as far as the village of Comitancillo  (27 miles) along a carriage road through forest, similar to that from the port  to Santa Maria. At a short distance beyond Comitancillo, the line enters upon a somewhat barren plain, over which it runs for about  7 miles to San Geronimo (34 miles from Salina Cruz Station).</p>
  <p align="left">San Geronimo is the first  repairing station on the Line. We halted here for the night; and from this point Mr. Bright  and myself had the advantage of being joined  by Mr. Swartz, the Superintendent of the Line, who escorted us across  the rest of the Isthmus.</p>
  <p align="left">Passing through San Geronimo, the Line crosses the  Juchitan River, which is easily spanned and always fordable, and follows a  bullock-cart track through woods and  cultivated fields to the Rio Verde at the entrance of the Chivela Pass  (42 miles). The Rio Verde is narrow, but I am  not sure that it is always fordable in the rainy season. I think, however,  that there is high ground on both sides of  the river; if so, it would be an  easy matter for the linesmen to make a rough bridge above the reach of  the flood, there being plenty of tall trees close at hand for the purpose.</p>
  <p align="left">The Chivela Pass constitutes the first difficulty of any  magnitude. Here the Line frequently leaves the circuitous  mule-track, and sometimes stretches by spans of considerable length  across deep ravines. But the mule-track,  though circuitous, is good; and the linesman has the advantage of being able to move rapidly from point  to point along his Line when  searching for a fault. The Pass extends for about 5 miles, after which  the Line runs over an open plain for about 2 or 3 miles, and then follows the direct mule-track over the hills  towards Sarabia. On the Chivela Plain  we diverged from the Line, halting for the night at El Barrio de la  Soledad, and falling in with the Line again next morning near the Xochiapa Hillocks. By this detour, we  traversed some 17 or 18 miles,  instead of the 10 or 12 of direct route; but all our way was over exceptionally easy ground, whereas I was told  that on the direct route there was  much hard climbing, and the Line in some parts can only be followed on  foot. El Barrio seemed to me by far the pleasantest place on the Isthmus. The  air was quite cool and refreshing there.</p>
  <p align="left">From a point a little beyond the Xochiapa Hillocks to the  Sarabia river, a distance of about 10 or 12 miles, the ground is again  difficult. It consists of mountainous forests where the mule-track is  bad, winding up and down steep hill-sides,  and through swampy bottoms covered with  high grass and underwood. The Line follows the general direction of the mule-track, but it departs from it a little  at several points where the track is circuitous.</p>
  <p align="left">The  Malatengo River (71 miles), which has to be crossed, is comparatively broad,  but well within an ordinary span. It is not always fordable, but, being sluggish, could be safely swum at all  seasons. This is not the case, however, with the Sarabia River, which is  narrow and so rapid when in torrent that there is no  chance for man or horse if carried below the right landing-place at  the ford. We were caught at this spot by a  most drenching tropical deluge, and I did not notice the character of the banks very particularly;  but, as far as I remember, on one side  at least the ground was not high enough to save a tree-bridge from being swept away by the flood. Probably, however, some spot might be found not far off where  such a bridge could be safely  placed.</p>
  <p align="left">From the Sarabia River to the  cattle-ranch of the Messrs. De Gyves, the ground is open and the Line free from danger.  Here we halted for the night, and  found everybody miserably sick with fever and ague, except Mr. Hennessy, the linesman of this  district. There is much swamp in the  neighbourhood, and the site of the house that had just been built for the repairing staff was  unfortunately selected in the dry  season.</p>
  <p align="left">From Sarabia Station to La  Puerta, a distance of about 9 miles, the first half of the  way lies over open ground like that between the river and the station, while the other half runs through  forest, but over tolerably smooth  ground, a considerable portion of it being along a broad timber-track.</p>
  <p align="left">At La Puerta (88 miles) there is a small ranch well  placed on a high cliff above the Jumuapa  River. Ferry-canoes are kept both here and on the Tortuguero Branch,  which has to be crossed a little further on.</p>
  <p align="left">We had to halt at La Puerta  after only a very short day&rsquo;s march, as there is no  ranch of any kind between there and Suchil; but on the next day the powers of our horses and mules were  taxed to the very utmost. We followed the Line for a short distance from  La Puerta, and found it in great jeopardy in  one place, and at another it was completely  down.</p>
  <p align="left">We freed it from its danger at  the first spot where a partially broken branch was resting on the wire; and at the  second place, where a tree had fallen  and pinned the wire down for a long distance in the high wet grass and undergrowth, we restored  communication at about 10 a.m. on October 4th.</p>
  <p align="left">At a point about 12  miles from La Puerta the Line diverges from the trail and runs northward through dense, and trackless forest for  about 56 miles to Jaltipan. Between Jaltipan and  Coatzacoalcos the ground is, I believe, all swampy; but for the last 12 of  these 30 miles the Line has the  advantage of being alongside the Tehuantepec Inter-Oceanic Rail-Road.</p>
  <p>We continued our journey  eastward to Suchil, and considered ourselves very fortunate in arriving there without  accident. We had been incessantly  climbing up and down steep hills all the day. The trail was in a  terrible state of slime and deep mud, and we noticed several skeletons of mules that had  perished on the way. From Suchil we proceeded by river to Coatzacoalcos.</p>
  <p align="left">From the foregoing  description you will see that the Line traverses in all about 190 statute miles, of  which, approximately, 25 are over open plains, 45 are along roads, 55  are in forest, but along or near to the track used by the caravans of pack-mules which cross  the Isthmus in  considerable numbers, and  the remaining 65 miles are constructed over ground trodden only by the  linesmen. I may here remark of the whole  Line, that it seemed to be very little molested by human beings, animals, birds, or insects. In  some places the lower part of the earthwire, which is attached to the wooden poles for a  lightning-guard, had been stolen: and  here and there we came across localities where several poles had been  pecked by birds, in some cases to a very dangerous extent. Mr. Swartz told me that it was  intended to gradually replace the wooden  by iron poles: if this were done, of course  both these dangers would vanish. </p>
  <p align="left">The  25 miles of open plains lie almost entirely on the southern half of the Isthmus. The Line is not  exposed in these parts to any extraordinary danger whatever; but when, on comparatively  rare occasions, accidents may occur the fault would be  quickly reached and repaired, as the roads on this side of the Isthmus are  good. When  I was  at Coatzacoalcos I had occasion to make particular inquiries concerning cyclones, and I  learned that the Isthmus was never visited by them. The &ldquo; Northers,&rdquo; so much dreaded on the Gulf coast, blow right across the Isthmus; but  most of their violence is spent before they reach the patches of open  ground which lie on the southern side. </p>
  <p align="left">The 45 miles of Line that run along roads are  exposed to intermittent faults,  if the growth of underwood and branches of trees be not kept efficiently in check; and in a modified degree they  are liable to total interruptions caused by falling trees and branches. The  roads are broad, allowing the Line to be  placed clear of all but the tallest trees, on one side of it at least. Of  these 45 miles, 30 lie between Salina Cruz and the Rio Verde over good solid ground, and the  remaining 15 consist of the abandoned Tehuantepec  Inter-Oceanic Rail-Road, which extends  through a swamp from Coatzacoalcos towards Jaltipan. </p>
  <p align="left">Both the 55 miles of  Line that run through forest, but along or in the neighbourhood of the  mule-track, and the 65 miles that lie remote from any trail whatever, are  exposed to enormous danger from forest fires in dry season and from  floods between June and October. Practically there is no preventing the extremely frequent  interruptions  that  occur in the forest. Labour is very dear, and I should think it would be out of the question to attempt to clear  all the timber that in  falling could reach the Line. As you are aware, the construction of this Line was carried out in great haste and  under extraordinary difficulties; and it is no wonder, therefore, if room  has been left for one or two minor improvements  that may slightly reduce the liability to interruption. Here and there, by the substitution of  steel for iron wire, and the consequent gain in  length of span, the necessity of having a pole in a dangerous  position might be avoided; and in swamps, where poles frequently  fall, carrying the wire with them but  not generally breaking it, it might be worth while to have an <em>insulated </em>conductor--say 3 No. 19 copper  wires, stranded, covered with indiarubber and served with tarred  hemp&mdash;looped up to the existing bare iron wire, which latter would  here be cut out of the electrical circuit, and retained only as a mechanical support to the core.  Again, in one or two places it  might be desirable to divert the Line slightly from its present route, as, for instance,  in the neighbourhood of El Barrio de la Soledad.</p>
  <p align="left">But after every practical precaution has been taken to  reduce the liability to accidents,  interruptions must nevertheless continue to be very frequent, and the point of main interest therefore  is to consider the facilities  afforded for rapid repairs.</p>
  <p align="left">About 40 out of the 55 miles of trail under  discussion are good, and permit the linesmen to move quickly from point to point  along the line; but over the remaining 15  miles of trail, and over the whole of the 65 miles that are trodden  only by linesmen, locomotion is very slow  and entails a very large expenditure of mules. I have no personal knowledge of these 65  miles, but I learned from Mr. Swartz and his linesmen that for the  whole of that distance the ground was at least as bad as that between  La Puerta and Suchil; and that this portion of the Line was worse  situated than any other, in respect to rivers and torrents. When we crossed the Isthmus Mr. Swartz intended to have followed the&nbsp;Line  to  Coatzacoalcos, but he had to give up the idea in consequence of the great  probability of being delayed several days, waiting for the  Jaltipec to subside.</p>
  <p align="left">The rainy season was then drawing to its close, but I was  assured on all sides that there had been a  quite exceptional scarcity of rain, so that it was by no means at its worst that I saw the Line and  gained experience of the difficulty of  maintaining it. At that time there were 5 stations, and a staff consisting of a superintendent  and 3 linesmen (all Americans), 3 operators,  exclusive of those at the terminal (cable) stations, and 6  natives. But directly the Line was opened for public traffic this staff was found quite  inadequate; and, before I left Coatzacoalcos, orders had been received for the  immediate establishment of two new repairing  stations, involving 2 more operators, 2 more linesmen,  2 more natives, and 4 more mules. These two new stations were to be added to the  districts between La Puerta and Coatzacoalcos, in which four-fifths of the interruptions had  occurred.</p>
  <p align="left">As I descended the Coatzacoalcos River I could not fail to be impressed with the fact that a light cable might  have been laid along it in a position of great safety, at least from Suchil, if not from La Puerta, or even from some point further south. Had  this been done nearly all the most  difficult ground which the present overhead line traverses would have been avoided. This otherwise obvious route was neglected in favour of the one which was  projected for the Tehuantepec Inter-Oceanic Rail-Road. If this railway existed in  fact, it would of course be an easy matter to keep in repair the  telegraph here alongside of it; but, unfortunately, the T.I.O.R.R. Co., whose headquarters are in New York, have had to suspend  their operations. The time allowed them for completing their railway  had expired and not a tithe of the work was done. The Company had  expected to get an extension of the terms of their concessions,  but they were disappointed. </p>
  <p align="left">At the time we crossed the Isthmus it was currently  reported that the Mexican Government had decided to build and work  this railway itself, and had granted a contract for the construction to  one of its own citizens&mdash;Mr.  Sanchez&mdash;who had had influence enough to secure very favourable terms. The  Government is interested in thisrailway, not only in a general and indirect sense as an aid to the development  of the country, but <em>directly, </em>inasmuch as it would  enable them to move troops rapidly <em>via </em>Vera Cruz, Coatzacoalcos,  and Salina Cruz, to places on the Pacific where political revolutions frequently  occur. It was further reported that in this contract the Government  undertook the payment, on account, as each kilometre was completed, of a  certain fixed sum, being a large proportion of the total price per  kilometre, and that the contractor was left perfectly free to arrange for  himself the order in which the different portions of the work should be  done. I have forgotten the  amount of the payment on account per kilometre, but I remember that it was such as,  by itself, to pay a handsome profit on the easy parts of the route, though insufficient to meet the cost of  the more difficult portions. </p>
  <p align="left">It seemed to be a very general  opinion on the Isthmus that Mr. Sanchez  would commence operations not from Coatzacoalcos, which is more favourably  situated for the import of material, and where already about  twelve miles are made, but from Salina Cruz, whence there is a rise of  easy gradient for about three miles to Zuleta, followed by about forty  miles of perfectly level and solid ground. This constitutes by far the easiest portion of the whole line, the  levelling up to Zuleta and the &nbsp;bridging of the Tehuantepec and Juchitan Rivers  being works of no magnitude; and it is possible that when this section is  finished the contractor may  suddenly realize the difficulties ahead, and, contenting himself with the  profit made from the payments on account, leave the Government to find someone  else to go on with the undertaking.</p>
  <p align="left">I mention these rumours and  opinions as I heard them, but I am in no position to say what value  should be attached to them. To the C.  &amp; S.A. Telegraph Company the question of the probability of this railway being  constructed&mdash;especially on the <em>northern </em>half of the Isthmus&mdash;is one of prime interest.</p>
  <p align="left">Without the railway the cost of  keeping the telegraph line in repair is, as I learned from Mr.  Swartz, extremely heavy. I took his figures, and forming a rough estimate of the cost of a cable laid  in or near the Coatzacoalcos River, I  concluded that if it is thought improbable that the railway will be built within a reasonable  time, it would be well worth the while of the C. &amp; S.A. Co. to consider  thoroughly the question of  even now abandoning the northern half of their overhead line.</p>
  <p align="left">Such a question could not be satisfactorily  discussed except in great detail and with definite data to hand; but the matter  would be settled at  once in favour of retaining the overhead line, if within, say ten years, the expense of its maintenance  is to be reduced to a comparatively  trifling sum through the existence of a railway alongside it.</p>

  <p class="center">MR. DARLING&rsquo;S  REPORT ON THE &ldquo;RETRIEVER&rsquo;S&rdquo; SURVEY.
    
  </p>
  <p align="left">The specimens of the bottom brought up during  sounding operations varied very slightly. They consisted principally of green  coloured mud,  in some cases being dark  coloured, and others, again, being of a lighter colour. Near the shore the bottom evidently  consisted of sand, mixed occasionally with very small shells, but owing to its  being washed out of  the sinker during the time of heaving up there was never sufficient to examine it chemically; some few particles generally  adhered to the sinker, and by pressing the finger against them they were found to  be gritty to  the  touch. </p>
  <p align="left">As the ship got away from the land the sand gradually  disappeared  and  larger samples were obtained; these, as above stated, consisted of green clayey mud, sometimes  containing a considerable quantity of minute shells. On examination they were found to consist  principally  of silica or sand, alumina, with small quantities of organic matter, oxide of iron, lime and magnesia. No  manganese, copper, or magnetic oxide of  iron was found in any of them. </p>
  <p align="left">There was only one occasion where the specimen varied  decidedly from the others&mdash;this was in  sample No. 82, when a small white stone about the size of a pea was  brought up. The sinker had evidently landed  on the top of it by chance, and the sand being washed out while bringing to the surface, the  stone was left. On analysis it proved to be a small piece of quartz. </p>
  <p align="left">I have refrained from giving  the numbers of the samples examined, with  the exception of sample No. 82, as the numbering was not at all satisfactory, and, in fact, could not be depended  upon. It was impossible for  one person to be present and attend to the numbering night and day, and although various expedients were resorted to, it  was found that the samples  invariably got mixed and out of order, the difficulty arising from the fact that on some occasions  no sample was obtained. In future some arrangement might be made which would prove more  effectual,  and in my opinion this is  absolutely necessary. </p>
  <p align="left">On  account of the large number of specimens obtained during  the sounding operations, it was  found impossible to keep pace with the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; and analyze every sample as  collected; it was determined, therefore, to pick out a number of samples obtained in  the different  sections and examine them  more particularly. </p>
  <p align="left">Owing to a mistake the deep-sea  thermometers which had been sent out went astray and did not arrive until too late. The  thermometer  which  was employed had been in use for a considerable time, and possibly read too high. Some attempts were made to compare it  with a standard,
    but owing to the high temperature of the atmosphere at the  time, and also to the difficulty of  procuring a suitable vessel for the purpose, it could not be tested satisfactorily. 
    The temperature and  specific gravity of the surface water was taken every day at noon while at sea. 
  </p>
  <p align="left">Judging from the experience gained during  this expedition, there are several points which might be attended to with  considerable advantage in carrying out a similar investigation on a future  occasion. In the first  place, it is necessary that a place on board should be set aside for carrying out experiments, and  it should be fitted up so that work could be commenced as soon as samples were obtained. Could  this have been  possible  in this expedition, an accident which is explained elsewhere would have been avoided, and  considerable time saved. The thermometers  might, of course, be on board before starting, which would do away with any chance of their going astray, as  above-mentioned. </p>

  <p>DEAR SIR,</p>
  <p>I beg to hand you the following  Electrical Report on the Central and South American Cable Expedition. I have not  confined this  report to exclusively electrical limits but have endeavoured to give a general idea of the nature of the  enterprise, the manner in which the undertaking was brought to a successful  conclusion, and a description not only of the cable, its manufacture, transport,  and submersion, but also of the  ships and staff employed and their distribution during the operations. </p>
  <p>In  this report I have given but a brief account of the laying of the Vera Cruz and Coatzocoalcos section, this being a  continuation of the Central and South American Telegraph Company&rsquo;s  system on the Atlantic side; my report, with this exception,  treating of the work executed  on the Pacific side. </p>
  <p>For the convenience of  reference I have arranged this Report under different headings with an index, endeavouring so  far as possible to separate the various subjects dealt with into  divisions, the headings being a  guide to the information contained in each such division. </p>
  <p>I have  been somewhat puzzled to know where to draw the line between a sufficiently explicit  report and a too diffuse account of the work, for there are in an  expedition of this magnitude, extending over such a considerable period,  undergoing such changes in climate and ground, and consequently varying the nature of the  operations, so many subjects of  interest alike to the Electrician as to the Engineer, and, in &nbsp;fact,  interesting to all who share such work or who may be connected in any way with the undertaking, that it seems really  impossible to give a just idea of the work  without going far beyond the limits generally assigned to an &ldquo;Electrical Report.&rdquo; This, Sir, must  be my excuse for touching upon subjects  unconnected with the electrical condition of the cables, to which excuse may be added the  advantage of having in a comparatively small space a general description of the  whole undertaking.</p>
  <p>  You  will perceive that but little mention is made of the laying and position of the Buenaventura River cables, the notes at my  command being somewhat scanty.&mdash;I  remain, Sir, very faithfully yours,

She then loaded with grain at Talcahuano, and copper at Lota for  her voyage home. </p>
<p>For  disposal of staff after departure of &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; &nbsp;from the West Coast see under &ldquo;Staff.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo;  landed the following Shore-Ends&mdash;Chorillos Shore-End, north and south Shore-Ends at Payta, and south Shore-End at Santa Elena. </p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  came off works on Jan. 19th, 1882 from docking. Shipping cable on  her for the Pacific sections of the Central and South  American cables was commenced on Jan. 21st, 1882, and  nearly completed off the works on Feb. 7th, when she left  her moorings off Silvertown, and went into the Albert  Docks. Here shipping was resumed on Feb. 17th, and  completed on Feb. 21st.

<p>Chorillos and Payta</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The  Shore-End, at Chorillos was laid by the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; on January 24th, 1882,  shortly after her arrival at Callao. She then steamed north, and at Payta, after landing the  Shore-End for the Santa Elena section she laid on January 30th, the Shore-End and Intermediate for the Chorillos section. The &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo;  then proceeded to Santa Elena and laid the cable from there southwards to  Payta. From Payta the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; laid the Deep-sea cable southwards towards  Chorillos, commencing at the Intermediate End at Payta on February 9th, and splicing on to Intermediate on board off Chorillos on  February 13th. On the night of the 13th the ship lay at anchor, it being too  dark to run the Intermediate in to splice with the Shore-End on that day,  and on the 14th the Intermediate was run in, the splice made with the Shore-End, and section completed. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Payta and Santa Elena</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Shore-End at  Payta for this section was laid on  January 29th. The &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; then went north, and on February 4th  laid the Santa Elena Shore-End. The contract requiring that the Intermediate  should reach the 100-fathom line, it was found, on the necessary  sounding being taken, that there  would not be sufficient of that type on board to complete according to specification, the Intermediates on both the Chorillos-Payta, and  Payta-Santa Elena sections, the  100-fathom line being so far from shore. Accordingly the Intermediate was reserved to complete in  all respects the Chorillos-Payta section, and on February 6th and 7th Deep-sea type was laid southwards, between the Shore-Ends at Santa  Elena and Payta. The first work the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; did on her  arrival on coast was to place Intermediate in instead of Deep-sea, at Payta on May  14th and at Santa Elena on May 17th. </p>
  <p>On Sept. 16th this section  was broken by an earthquake, probably causing a landslip on line of  cable, and it was repaired by &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; and lengthened by  8.01 N.M. Deep-sea type, on  October 3rd. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Santa Elena and Buenaventura</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The  Santa Elena Shore-End was laid by the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; on February 2nd, and the Intermediate on May 22nd by the &ldquo;Silvertown.&rdquo;  The latter ship from May 22nd to May 25th laid the Deep-sea portion from Santa Elena northwards to mouth of the Buenaventura River. No Shore-End  was landed  here,  the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; on May 27th laying Intermediate from Malaga Bay on north  side of entrance to  River, out to the Deep-sea. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Buenaventura and Pedro Gonzales</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No Shore-End was landed at  Malaga Bay (Buenaventura)  the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; laying the Intermediate on May 29th. The &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; commenced laying Deep-sea towards the Pearl  Islands on May 30th. On May 31st cable was cut and buoyed off Cape Marzo, the ship proceeding to  sound, and to survey the Pearl Islands in order to discover a suitable landing place. The Island of  Pedro Gonzales was selected,  the Shore-End was landed there on June the 8th, and the Intermediate  on June 9th. On June 10th the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; commenced laying Deep-sea from Pedro Gonzales, southwards, and on June 11th made splice with end buoyed off  Cape Marzo, completing  section. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Buenaventura River</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; commenced  laying two cables between hut at Malaga Bay and the town of Buenaventura (about 15 miles up the  river) on September 7th. She completed both cables on September 10th. She proceeded south after some days spent at Buenaventura, and on her way  repaired the Payta-Santa Elena  section. </p>
  <p>No. 1  cable consisted of 12.5 N.M. of Intermediate and  10 N.M. of  Deep-sea. No. 2 cable was composed entirely  of Intermediate, 22.0 N.M.  in length. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Pedro Gonzales and Panama</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The  Shore-End at Pedro Gonzales was landed on June 9th, and the &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo;  assisted by a lighter (owing to  the excessively shoal water) landed the Panama Shore-End on June 14th and 15th.  The &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; then, on June  21st, laid the main cable from Panama Shore-End towards Pedro Gonzales. This main cable consisted entirely of Intermediate type. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Pedro Gonzales and S. Juan del Sur</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The  Shore-End at Pedro Gonzales was landed on June 9th, the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  then laying the section to Panama,  after which she proceeded north. On June 29th the Shore-End at San Juan  del Sur was landed, and the ship then went northwards. On her return to San Juan del Sur, the Intermediate was  laid on July 24th and 25th. Some difficulty was here experienced owing to a foul flake coming up and breaking Intermediate. On July 25th ship commenced  paying out Deep-sea towards Pedro Gonzales, but on July 27th a fault declared  itself some distance astern. The cable was cut and buoyed and ship proceeded to Panama. On August 4th, the Intermediate  at Pedro Gonzales was laid, and on same day ship commenced paying out Deep-sea cable towards buoy on the San Juan end. On August 6th the cable was  cut and buoyed, and ship steamed to buoy on  San Juan end, which was picked up on  August 7th, a splice made with cable  on board and ship paid out to buoy on  Pedro Gonzales end, a splice was made  with this and bight let go. The ship then  proceeded to grapple for cable near fault, and picked it up on August 9th. Cable was cut and Pedro Gonzales end buoyed, the fault being found  towards S. Juan del Sur. The cable was picked  up until fault came on board, a splice  was made with cable in ship, and cable was paid out back to buoy on Pedro Gonzales end. The final splice was here made  on August 10th, and section completed.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>S. Juan del Sur and Libertad</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Shore-End at San Juan  del Sur was landed on June 29th, and the  Intermediate on July 2nd. Deep-sea  cable was then paid out northwards. On July 3rd the Deep-sea cable was cut off Libertad, 227 N.M. of all types having been paid  out and end buoyed. This was owing to some uncertainty on the  part of the engineers of the Central and  South American Co., as to whether the  cable would be laid into Libertad or  continued on to San Jos&eacute; in Guatemala.  The ships proceeded to San Jos&eacute;, and there it was decided to make  Libertad the cable station. The Libertad  and Salina Cruz section was then laid. On July 17th the ships being at Libertad, the Shore-End for the southern section was landed, and on July  20th and 21st the Intermediate and Deep-sea necessary to run out to buoy on San Juan end  was laid, and section completed  on latter date. The ships (&ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; and &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;) then steamed for San Juan. On their arrival there it was found that a fault existed in the section (July 23rd). The &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; repaired this fault on August 13th, and  four  hours after final splice was made, another fault was discovered in section on the usual tests after completion being made. This  second fault was  repaired by the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; on August 19th.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Libertad and Salina Cruz</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This  section was laid from Salina Cruz (the northernmost station on the line of cable in the Pacific) southwards towards Libertad. The Shore-End was landed at Salina Cruz on July 10th, by means of a rocket, employed to carry the lines, as  no boat.  could live in the tremendous surf. The Intermediate was laid on July 12th and 13th, the Deep-sea was then laid out and cut off Libertad on July 16th, and buoyed. The Shore-End was landed on July 17th. The Intermediate and Deep-sea necessary to run out to buoy on Salina Cruz end were laid on the 18th, final splice made, and section completed on  that date.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Vera Cruz and Coatzocoalcos</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This section (on the  Atlantic coast) was composed entirely of Intermediate. Part of the section was  laid in March, 1881, by &ldquo;Dacia,&rdquo; when, after completing the Mexican system, she  laid her surplus cable, consisting of 49.7 N.M. of Intermediate to the south of Vera Cruz. </p>
  <p>The &ldquo;International,&rdquo; on  December 20, 1881, picked up the end of the cable laid by &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; off Cabeza reef and buoyed end.</p>
  <p>Owing  to ship getting on a shoal, and weather being stormy, the Vera Cruz Shore-End was not landed until the 27th December. </p>
  <p>On the 28th December the Intermediate was laid between Shore-End and the end buoyed previously (Dec. 20th) and splice made. The  ship then steamed for the other end of the cable laid by &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; off Monte Pio. This end was picked  up on the 29th, but owing to bad weather the ship had to buoy it (after picking up some few miles) and run for Anton  Lizardo. </p>
  <p>On Dec. 31st the ship proceeded  to Coatzocoalcos and  landed the Shore-End there on January 1st, 1882.  On 2nd January the Intermediate between Shore-End at Coatzocoalcos and the  buoy on Intermediate end off Monte Pio was laid, final splice made and section completed on January 20. </p>
  <p>Messrs. Theop. Smith, Rippon,  and O&rsquo;Brien and 7 cable  hands left the &ldquo;International&rdquo; at Jamaica and  proceeded per steamer &ldquo;Don&rdquo; to Colon, on their way to  join the expedition on the Pacific side. </p>

<p>Chorillos and Payta Section</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>During the laying of this  section by &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; a fault  occurred on February 11th, 1882, and was first noticed, the deflection  suddenly going off scale, when 219 N.M. had been paid out from the Payta end. There had been no sign of  anything amiss  up to  that moment, the readings being perfectly steady, and the continuity  signals on board and on shore being quite satisfactory. On communicating with shore on mirror instrument we found that the continuity signals at hut decreased to a third of  the ordinary throw at the moment  the sudden rise of deflection  was noticed on board. During the time we were communicating with shore and testing, the ship had continued to pay out  cable, so that by the time the fault had been localised and the cable cut, the fault was found to be  about 8 N.M. astern. 11 N.M. were picked up and the fault discovered in the piece picked up, and at 9.5  N.M. from the place where  cable was first cut. </p>

<p>S. Juan del Sur and Libertad Section</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Two days after this section  was completed a fault appeared in it, on July 23rd, and was localised at 224 N.M. from San Juan del Sur.  The cable was  repaired by Mr. King in &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo;  on August 13th. </p>
  <p>The cable during the laying, and immediately after completion, had shown no sign of weakness. </p>
  <p>Another fault appeared in  this section immediately after the last repair on August 13th. The cable, prior to final splice in last  repairs, had been tested from  Libertad, San Juan, and &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo; and appeared to be all right. Four  hours after final splice, and while cable was being tested after completion, a fault declared itself. This was  localised at 156 N.M. from San Juan del Sur, and repaired by &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; on August 19th. </p>
  <p>It was  at first supposed that this fault was due to some damage done to cable by propeller on letting go the bight in the final splice  in last repairs, but this was  found, on picking cable up not to be the case. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>S. Juan del Sur and Pedro Gonzales Section</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>During the laying of this section a fault declared itself on July 27th, when 214  N.M. had been paid out. It  was localised at 80 N.M. from San Juan, but was discovered to be at 74 N.M.  from that place when repaired by Mr. R.K. Gray in Silvertown on August 9th. </p>
  <p>This  section broke down on September 15th, nearly three months after its completion, and nearly two months after the guarantee of thirty days had  elapsed, and the cable accepted by the Central  and South American Co.&rsquo;s representative. </p>
  <p>The cable was found to be  broken off Cape Blanco, and had been localised at 180 N.M. from Santa Elena. It was repaired by Mr. E.W.  Parson&eacute;, with  &ldquo;Retriever,&rdquo; on October  3rd, 1882. </p>
  <p>This  break was undoubtedly due to a submarine landslip, caused by an  earthquake of much severity felt  along that part of the coast on the date the cable broke down. </p>

<p>&ldquo;International&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The following gentlemen went out to the Gulf of Mexico on board the &ldquo;International&rdquo;  to lay the  section  between Vera Cruz and Coatzocoalcos. Mr. Theop. Smith, engineer in charge; Mr. J. Rippon, electrician; Mr. W.F. O&rsquo;Brien,  secretary and purser; and Mr. J. Stoddart, assistant engineer. No representative of the Central and South American Telegraph Company accompanied the  ship on her voyage out, but on her arrival at Vera Cruz Mr. Hiscott joined the expedition, on behalf of Mr. Stearns, the engineer to said Company.  During the laying of this section Mr. Rippon kept watch on shore at Coatzocoalcos. </p>
  <p>After completion of  section, Messrs Smith, Rippon, O&rsquo;Brien,  and seven cable hands left the &ldquo;International&rdquo; and joined the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; at  Payta, Peru <em>via </em>Jamaica, and Isthmus of Panama. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dacia&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The following staff went out to  the Pacific <em>via </em>the Straits of Magellan, on board  the &ldquo;Dacia.&rdquo; Mr. W.F. King, engineer in charge; Messrs J.K. Gray, W.E. Cook, C. Hawkins, and H. P.  Daley, assistant engineers; Mr. E. March Webb, chief electrician; and Messrs J. Rymer Jones, R. Balkwill, J.K.T. Belam, H.E. Cann, and H.L.  Webb, assistant electricians. Mr. Stearns was represented during the voyage out by Mr. A. Kelly. </p>
  <p>At  Payta, on February 7th, 1882, the staff was increased by the arrival of Messrs Smith, Rippon,  and O&rsquo;Brien coming from the Gulf of Mexico after completion of the Vera Cruz and Coatzocoalcos section. </p>
  <p>During the laying of the  Payta-Santa Elena section Messrs J. Rymer Jones and H.E. Cann kept watch at Santa Elena end, and during the laying of the Chorillos-Payta section, Messrs J. Rippon and H.L. Webb kept watch at Payta hut.  These gentlemen remained at their respective stations till the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; arrived on the  coast. After completion of these two sections the &ldquo;Dacia,&rdquo; on February 20th left Callao on her homeward  voyage, Messrs W.F. King, E. March Webb, W.F. O&rsquo;Brien, and R. Balkwill, remaining at Lima, while Messrs Theop. Smith, Belam, and Daley, with all cable  hands, went in  &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo;  to Concepcion, Chile, where they remained till &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; arrived on coast. The cable hands were taken to Concep&ccedil;ion as this place  in regard to healthiness of  climate and cheapness of living  offered greater advantages than any other easily accessible part of the West Coast of South America. </p>
  <p>On  arrival of &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; at Callao, Mr. G.A. Darling, analytical chemist, joined the expedition,  having come out per Royal Mail via  Panama. He, with Messrs  J. K. Gray and C. Hawkins, after the &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; had completed her work, joined  the &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; under Mr. E.W. Parson&ecirc; (manager of West Coast of America Cable Co.), and proceeded north to take soundings and make preliminary  surveys of landing places along line of cable between Santa Elena and Salina Cruz. </p>
  <p>Mr.  Darling was engaged by the India Rubber Gutta Percha and  Telegraph Works Company to analyse and report upon the nature of the  bottom as shown by the specimens brought up by the various soundings, so that  in laying the cable any ground the nature of  which could prove injurious to the cable might be avoided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The following staff went  out in the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;: Mr. M.H.  Gray, engineer in charge; and Messrs H.M. Walter, W.L. Swift, and G.H. Bailey, assistant engineers; Mr. W.S. Seaton, electrician in charge; and Messrs A.E. Gilbert, E. Stallibrass, C.  Bright, C.N.C. Evers, and J.  Mathieson, assistant electricians.  Mr. Stearns was represented during voyage out by Messrs W.Stearns, W. Clarkson, and J. Milne.</p>
  <p>On arrival of &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  on coast, the staff and cable hands left by &ldquo;Dacia&rdquo; at Concep&ccedil;ion, and the staff at Lima joined her, Messrs Seaton and Daley  going on shore at Lima. Mr. Seaton later on  joined the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; at Panama,  Mr. Daley remaining at Lima.</p>
  <p>On  arrival of &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; at Callao Messrs Theop. Smith and J.  Rymer Jones left the expedition on the  Pacific side to meet the &ldquo;International&rdquo; at Jamaica for the Mexican extension expedition. Previous to arrival of &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; at Callao the  &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; had returned from the sounding  trip to the north. The staff on her  came ashore to await arrival of &ldquo;Silvertown,&rdquo;  and Mr. Parson&eacute; with &ldquo;Retriever&rdquo; went  south to repair the Chorillos-Mollendo  section.</p>
  <p>During  the alterations to the Payta-Santa Elena section, Mr. Rippon and Mr. Cann kept watch at the Santa Elena hut. Mr. H.L. Webb remaining at  Payta.</p>
  <p>On arrival of &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo;  at Payta, Mr. Robert Kaye Gray, chief of expedition, having come out by Royal Mail via Panama, joined the expedition on  May 13th.</p>
  <p>During the laying of the Santa  Elena-Buenaventura section, Messrs. Rippon  and Gilbert kept watch at Santa Elena hut, Mr. Cann returning on board.  Mr. Rippon subsequently joined the &ldquo;Silvertown&rdquo; at Panama, leaving Mr. Gilbert  at Santa Elena.</p>
  <p>During  the laying of the Buenaventura-Pedro Gonzales section, Messrs Balkwill and Evers kept  watch in hut at Malaga Bay, Buenaventura. They remained here during the remainder of the expedition.</p>
  <p>During the laying of the  Pedro Gonzales-San Juan del Sur section, Messrs Parson&eacute; and Bailey watched at  Pedro Gonzales, assisted by Messrs. Morton and Phillips, operators belonging to the Central and South America  Telegraph Company, and at the San Juan end  Messrs E. March Webb, Darling, and Belam,  kept watch.</p>
  <p>During the laying of the  San Juan del Sur-Libertad section, Messrs Rippon and Belam kept watch at San  Juan hut, and Messrs H.E. Cann and Stallibrass at Libertad. Mr. Rippon subsequently went to Panama and thence to  Lima, leaving Mr. Belam at San Juan.</p>
  <p>During  laying of Libertad-Salina Cruz section, Messrs. W.S.  Seaton and Bright kept watch at Salina Cruz hut.</p>
  <p>After the completion of  cables and during the 30 days&rsquo; guarantee,  the staff was distributed as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="center">GENERAL REMARKS.<br />
    <span class="size12">[Pages 47-54]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>The traffic on the Central and  South American Co.&rsquo;s cables will  be derived from two sources, the local  traffic and the North American and European. I think there can be little doubt that the whole of the latter  traffic from the West Coast and even from Buenos Ayres will take this route  once the land line across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is placed in good working  order, owing to the low rates at which the Central and South American Company  seem determined to work, for it is evidently the interest of the Transandine  Telegraph Company, the West Coast of America Telegraph Company, the Mexican  Cable Company, and the land line companies  in the States to further the development of this through traffic. Of course  the Western Brazilian, the Brazilian Submarine, and the West India and Panama Telegraph Companies will suffer in  consequence of such a strong competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>The great drawback to a  good local traffic is to be found in the want of satisfactory internal  telegraph communication. The state of the  land lines in the Central American Republics is lamentable, and in  Ecuador and Colombia there is little if any internal telegraph development. Notwithstanding this we find that  Buenaventura in Colombia and Libertad in Salvador  are both doing a good business. There should be a satisfactory traffic from Guayaquil  when the land line connecting that town with  Santa Elena (the cable station) is completed.</p>
  <p>From  Lima and Payta little local work is to be expected. Panama will not come up to the original expectations. San Juan del Sur may furnish a  couple of messages per day at the  outside, and Salina Cruz is merely a  transmitting station between the end of the cable system on the Pacific  side, and the land line across Tehuantepec to Coatzocoalcos on the Atlantic  side, where the cable system in the Gulf of Mexico commences.</p>
  <p>In  connection with the land lines in Central America, I may state that there is no united action  between the Republics for the improvement of  the land lines connecting one state with another, for they are  continually quarrelling, and many petty jealousies exist. To add to this there is a universal lack of funds, the land  lines are of the roughest and most temporary  construction, and the instruments of the oldest type, to say nothing of the want of energy among the officials and the ignorance of the  employes. The government of Nicaragua engaged Mr. Welsford, late of the  Central and South American Company, to inspect their land lines and to advise  as to their improvement. With the delivery of his report, how ever, the matter  has ended for the present, there being no money for re-construction. Should the  land lines connecting San Juan del Sur with the  interior of Nicaragua and with the adjoining state of Costa Rica be put  in fair working order, there is every likelihood of San Juan proving a profitable station. I think that Realejo, to the north of San Juan, would have  been found a better station for the cable so far as traffic is concerned. For more business is done there, it being a better port and nearer to the commercial centres of Nicaragua, such as Leon, than  is the small bay and village of San  Juan. During the time of the Transit Company, when passengers and goods  were carried to California <em>via </em>Greytown, on the Atlantic side, the River San Juan, the Lake of  Nicaragua, and the Bay of San Juan, there was considerable business at the  latter place, but since this traffic is now  carried on by the Pacific Railway in the  states, and by the Panama Railway, the only vessels ever seen at San Juan are the bi-monthly coasting steamers which trade between Panama and  the central American ports, touching at San Juan for the mails.</p>
  <p>Libertad is a very little place, it being the only  port of any importance in the Republic of  Salvador, though there is no shelter  for vessels. The best harbour in this Republic is at La Union, in the  Gulf of Fonseca, and a railway is being constructed from here into the interior. Another railway is being built from Sonsonate, a port to the north of Libertad, into the  interior, and a railway is talked of for Libertad. The capital, San Salvador, is only 30 miles from this place, but the roads are very bad. The small extent of  land line existing in this Republic is in the usual unsatisfactory condition.</p>
  <p>A question arose whether the  cable should be landed at  Libertad or at San Jos&eacute; in Guatemala. A railway is being constructed at the latter place, but is progressing  slowly, and will not for some considerable time touch any place of commercial  importance. Considering the business capabilities of the two places, Libertad has been wisely chosen, though the latter  will before long experience considerable rivalry from Sonsonate.</p>
  <p>To  revert again to San Juan del Sur. This place has more land  line communication than any other point touched at by the cables, it  being connected not only with the system  traversing the State of Nicaragua, but also with the land line system of  Costa Rica, the adjoining Republic. The line from San Juan to Costa Rica runs  through a very sparsely populated country, and suffers through want of roads  and from tropical vegetation. The linesmen in Nicaragua are paid by the day, with a very large deduction for every day the  lines are down, but even this stimulus to  prompt repairs does not prevent the lines being down for five or six  days together.</p>
  <p>The  nominal capital of the Republic of Nicaragua is the town of that name, about 23 miles distant  from San Juan, but there is no business done there. The business centre is  Leon, and the political Managua. After Leon, Granada is the most important  town. A railway is being constructed from  Realejo to Leon and Granada, and has already made considerable progress.</p>
  <p>The  traffic at Panama is fair, but without the impetus given to  all kinds of business by the requirements  of the Canal Company would not meet the original expectations. There has been, I believe, a steady  decline in trade at this place for some years. There is always a certain amount  of through goods traffic, but the exorbitant  freight charged by the Railway Company must cripple this trade to a  great extent. There is no land line communication between Panama and the rest  of the Republic {Colombia).</p>
  <p>A railway is being  constructed from this place into the  interior, and will tap some very productive districts, and it is  expected that the cable traffic will prove very good. The cable landing is at the mouth of the river Buenaventura, some  16 miles from the town. The cables are connected with the town by two river cables laid in the  river. There is a good depth  of water in the channel, but the navigation is difficult owing to the numerous sharp curves.  The. district, of which, Buenaventura  is the port, is one, of  the richest in the Republic of Colombia. </p>
  <p>Santa Elena is the cable  landing for the town of Guayaquil, the principal port in the Republic of Ecuador. A land line connects  the cables at Santa Elena  with the town of Guayaquil about 90 miles distant. I expect considerable  trouble will be experienced on the Guayaquil half of the land line, as it has to pass through dense forest,  and cross many creeks and rivers much flooded during the rainy season. The Santa Elena half passes through. dry and open country. There are no land  lines connecting Guayaquil with the rest of the Republic, and there is but little business with the interior, the frequent  political revolutions paralysing business.  The traffic, though fair,  can never I imagine prove very good. </p>
  <p>This  Peruvian port before the war did a little business with the interior, but  beyond a small export of  cattle there can be no  trade for many years, the immediate neighbourhood producing nothing. A railway connected Payta with an interior town called Piura, but this has been  destroyed. The only land line communication was with Lima, and this never very good. Nothing much can ever be expected in the way of cable traffic from Payta. </p>
  <p>Owing to the war all  business at Lima has suffered great depression, and the European traffic of course has fallen off in consequence. The  principal part of the local traffic is with the southern ports, and there is  little or no traffic to be expected  from the interior which can benefit the Central and South American cables. At present nearly all the traffic at Lima will come from the West Coast of America  Telegraph Company, being messages to the States and Europe from such southern ports as Yquique and  Valparaiso, and from the Atlantic side, viz., Buenos Ayres and Monte Video. </p>
  <p>I  think a mistake has been made in landing the cables at Payta instead of some such  place as Jupe, Casma, Huanchaco, Pacasmayo, or Zamabayequl, between Lima and Payta. All these ports have rich neighbourhoods, principally  sugar estates, and most of them do a large business in cattle. The sugar  estates have increased in value owing to the improvements in machinery,  and there is certain to be a large business done at these ports so soon as peace is assured, for they are  situated in the richest, I may say the  only fertile, part of the Peruvian  coast. </p>
  <p>I have  omitted to mention that the land line between Salina Cruz on the Pacific  side and Coatzocoalcos on the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec gives constant trouble, it being  down on an average two days a week. There are six intermediate stations, with three linesmen at each  station, and they cannot keep  the line in order owing to the dense vegetation. </p>
  <p>The  length of this land line is about 180 miles. Mr. France, the present manager  on the coast, has commenced clearing the forest on each side of the line, to prevent the interruptions  caused by falling trees. To be of any use this should be done for at least twenty yards on each side of  the line, and from my experience of much the same sort of work in a tropical forest, I can safely predict he has a long  and expensive undertaking before him. </p>
  <p>The  instruments supplied to the stations were the Double Current Morse,  Thomson&rsquo;s Reflecting Mirror, and  the new form of Siphon Recorder, but eventually the last named instrument was exclusively used on  both long and short sections. It gave great satisfaction, being simple in its  mechanism, and the condenser capacity  easily adjusted. The Siphon is suspended to a pair of small coils  (having a total resistance of 150 ohms), vibrating between the extremities of a  large permanent horse shoe compound magnet. These coils are suspended with fine  silk threads to an arm overhanging the  magnet. The clockwork for drawing off the tape is driven by a falling  weight. The ink is not electrified, and occasionally there is some trouble at  the start in getting the ink to run.</p>
  <p>The speed obtained between  San Juan del Sur and Panama, on the Recorder, a distance of 721 N.M., besides  the section to Buenaventura always in circuit, was about 18 words per minute.  Occasionally it was possible to work tolerably well between San Juan and Buenaventura with the <span class="verdana"><span class="size18">T</span></span> piece to Panama in circuit, a distance of 1028 N.M., not including the <span class="verdana"><span class="size18">T</span></span> piece,  but owing to the frequent interruptions from  Panama it was not found practicable  for regular work. Between San Juan and Salina Cruz (the cable ends  being connected at Libertad), a distance of  703 the speed was about 25 words per  minute. This speed only represents about one third of the possible working  speed of the cable. 12 Daniell cells were used at San Juan for working to Panama, and to Salina Cruz.</p>
  <p>The  ordinary Thomson&rsquo;s Reflecting Mirror was used between San  Juan and Buenaventura with 15 large  size Lechanch&eacute; Agglomerates, at a speed of about 15 words per minute.  From the cable hut at Chorillos to Panama  (intermediate stations connecting cable ends), a distance of 1674 N.M.,  about 8 words per minute could be obtained on mirror.</p>
  <p>The usual plan for working  through traffic was to work from Lima to Santa Elena, Payta joining ends, from Santa Elena to Panama, Buenaventura connecting  cable ends, Panama to San Juan del Sur, and San Juan del Sur to Salina Cruz, Libertad connecting ends. At first when Buenaventura had a through message  for States or Europe, Panama insulated and Buenaventura worked direct to San  Juan, the same being done if San Juan had any messages for the South. When Panama wished to speak  Buenaventura, San Juan insulated, Buenaventura doing the same if Panama wished to speak with San  Juan. This plan being found to work very badly was soon given up, and now Panama transmits all messages. </p>
  <p>The batteries which gave most satisfaction were those composed of the large size Lechanch&eacute;  Agglomerate cells. The best form  of this cell appears to be that in which an earthenware jar contains a circular zinc nearly the size of the jar enclosing a round  carbon block surrounded by six  agglomerate rods. The resistance of this cell is about 0.12 ohms, the electromotive force about 1.55 volts; it is remarkably constant. </p>
  <p>As a  proof of the excellence of this cell, the same battery of 10 cells has been  used day and night for more than two years in working the electric bells for the testing rooms and cable shops in our  factory, without anything whatever being done to the cells except  occasionally adding a little water, when this thorough evaporation became  low, and the battery works now  as well as at first. </p>
  <p>Our  cable ships, and the huts were supplied with this form of cell for copper  resistance, and it was also used for the speaking instruments in the huts. The stations employed Daniell  cells, but the universal opinion of the operators along the cables was in favour of the Lechanch&eacute;, it  being cleaner to handle, and  giving less trouble to keep in order. </p>
