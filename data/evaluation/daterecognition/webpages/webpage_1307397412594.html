The Productivity Paradox; Page  73
<P>
The subject of this book is computers-their problems and how to make
them better-but the analysis has taken us deep into the broader puzzle
of stunted productivity growth. Before going on about computers in par-
ticular, let us see if what we've learned suggests an explanation of the
overall productivity problem.
<P>
The Productivity Slowdown: A Hypothesis
<P>
The United States, with the rest of the industrial nations lined up a few
steps behind, has learned to automate its factories and agriculture so that
little human labor is needed. About a third of the population produces
almost everything people used to want-food, clothes, cars, trinkets,
houses. It turns out, though, that the rest of us aren't ready to retire. So
as a society, we've had to invent new work to do for each other and pay
each other for doing-a new set of exchanges. We cook meals for each
other, take in each other's dry cleaning, entertain each other, govern each
other, write books and produce movies for each other, take each other on
long trips, care for each other when sick, and organize gambling games-
finance and insurance, lawsuits, lately banking. These activities are not
entirely new, but they are being greatly expanded as a proportion of pro-
duction and consumption. They are called, loosely, "services." Most of
the work is "information work."
<BR><A HREF="#5W7G">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="5W7G"></A> Trouble is, this kind of work, doesn't have as good a ratio of labor
hours to dollars paid for the output as do the highly automated means of
production for food and other tangibles. Service labor productivity is

<A NAME="008P"></A> generally lower than that for goods-producing industries (Maddison
1991). It's not entirely clear why. Maybe services are not inherently as
valuable as food, shelter, defense, and things. Maybe there's something
unfathomable in the way money and services get related to each other;
perhaps the market economy simply makes an hour's worth of someone's
service labor worth the same amount to the buyer as to the seller (as
some government measures of productivity do). I don't believe these two
theories. Once adequately fed, housed, and bored, a person ought to be
willing to give up a twentieth pair of shoes for a good meal or massage.
A simple amplifier turns one hour of a musician's time into a hundred
hours of listeners' enjoyment; a television broadcast raises the productiv-
ity ratio much more.
   <BR><A HREF="#006R">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="006R"></A> A better explanation is that most services, unlike telephony, don't
know how to use capital productively. It is an economic truism that pro-
ductivity gains come from the substitution of capital for labor. Before
computers, service industries were stingy in putting capital to work for
workers. Services didn't use many machines and were not much auto-
mated because most of the work is mental, and, before the computer,
machines to help mental work were few and far behind.
   <BR><A HREF="#0070">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="0070"></A> The service industries have expanded. In the United States they em-
ployed 54 percent of the work force in 1950 and 63 percent in 1987,
while their productivity grew at less than 1 percent per year. In Germany,
the comparable numbers were 35 percent and 55 percent, with 2 percent
annual productivity growth (McKinsey Global Institute 1992). Thus a
large number of workers have migrated from industries with high output
per worker to ones with lower output and slower growth. Although the
workers may be doing similar tasks, the service industry is turning out
less added value because it does not exploit capital as well. The reason is
that sufficient high-quality capital, in the form of effective augmentation
technology, is not to be had.1
   <BR><A HREF="#00X2">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="00X2"></A> How has the service sector managed to expand so strongly? I think the
exhaustion of opportunities in manufacturing is the push and informa-
tion technology is the wagon. New jobs were needed, so new services
were invented. Many new or expanded services depended on computers:
a plethora of investment instruments-complex new mutual funds and
trading schemes, a deluge of new insurance policy types and options, a

myriad of debit and credit cards, dozens of new kinds of bank accounts
and novel banking services offered from widely dispersed branches and
machines, multitudes of new medical diagnosis techniques and therapies,
fast food restaurants, fast copy stores, fully filled planes with frequent

<A NAME="01R2"></A> "Aetna Insurance Company once analyzed the impact of IT on expense-
revenue ratios over a 15 year period. Although the study concluded that
IT had had little impact on these ratios, it also noted that the company
could never have increased its handling of health insurance claims from
250,000 per week to U million per week without using IT." (National
Research Council 1994a, 101).
<P>
   Computers made these expansions possible but didn't make them any
more productive. Indeed, productivity growth in services, always slower
than in other sectors but nevertheless measurable, virtually ground to a
halt after 1973 (McKinsey Global Institute 1992). Service sector manag-
ers bought most of the computers made in this era. They needed comput-
ers to keep up with exploding work loads in traditional jobs-many
more checks cashed, many more rental cars reserved. They needed com-
puters to support new lines of business-index funds, automated blood
tests.
   <BR><A HREF="#01Q7">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="01Q7"></A> Service managers thought that buying computers would set straight
the imbalance in capital support for work-that computers would do for
service productivity what the assembly line and fertilizer had done for
tangibles. They were misled. IT made it possible to do more work but
not to do work more productively. Usually each added dollar's worth of
IT capital produced just a dollar's worth of output before it was retired.
The new workers produced about the same amount of added value each
day as did the old. The total new output from services just about equaled
the total new input in IT equipment and the labor hours it required.2
   <BR><A HREF="#0127">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="0127"></A> The proposed explanation of the productivity slowdown thus goes like
this. IT was used primarily to expand the service sector. It created more
output, thus supporting more jobs-many of them supporting the IT it-
self-and allowed the absolute size of the economy to grow along with

   This view of the productivity story casts the computer in an odd role:
both the hero, the rescuer of work life, and the villain, the slacker that
flattens our standard of living. This view nevertheless resolves the para-
dox in our perception of computers. We see them as wonderful engines
of the modern economy and are perplexed that productivity has stag-
nated since their arrival. But there is no contradiction. Both as product,
where they've shored up average manufacturing productivity, and as
tools, where they have enabled expansion of the service sector, they have
performed impressively. Success, however, did not require that they in
crease productivity, only that they made possible more work at the same
productivity level. Service expansion depended on computers. The new
products, processes, and conveniences are just affordable with comput-
ers; they would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive without
them.
   <BR><A HREF="#0155">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="0155"></A> We are now left not so much with a paradox or puzzle about comput-
ers as merely with a problem. We can be proud of them for keeping us
going but would like them to help us go faster. So we have come back
toward our main track: Why are computers not better productivity tools,
and what can we do about it? Before joining these issues directly, we
have a few untied strands to deal with-objections to the computer pro-
ductivity conclusions-and will take these up in the next chapter. Mean
while, let us review the bidding.

<A NAME="0175"></A> Summary of the Evidence against Computers
<P>
Beginning around 1985, a few economists began to sing the blues about
a disappointing love affair between American business and computers.
Since then, the refrain of these soloists has turned into a chorus. I have
replayed here all the major themes: the downturn of productivity growth
over time coincident with widespread computerization, the concentra-
tion of growth failure in industries most heavily involved, the failure of
labor productivity in services to respond positively to lavish information
technology, the long-term lack of correlation of business success with

investment in this new technology. And we have looked closely, wherever
a view was to be had, at the direct effects of computers as they try to
lend a hand to people at work. Almost everything points to the conclu-
sion that computers have failed to work wonders for productivity. Yet
there are exceptions to raise hope at each level of the story: some appar-
ently successful countries, industries, programs. Our next endeavor will
be to understand why the majority of the picture looks so grim. Both
negative and positive cases should help us find an explanation, which
should lead to a response.

   <A NAME="01S8"></A> I have presented the material covered this far many times to audiences of
computer professionals. At this point hands wave all over the audience.
People are eager to refute the apparent implications of all these facts.
Many of the refutations consist only of declarations of love for the com-
puter or recount some special program or function that he or she "could
not do without." Another form of refutation is to point to known success
stories, like computer-aided design or bank bookkeeping or to note the
large number of sales, and penetration in numbers of, for example, PCs,
spreadsheet programs, and ATMs. If these products have sold so well
they must be good, the reasoning runs. Certainly this is all true in a sense.
But if these uses of computers have not increased productivity-and it
seems they have not-then we need to find some other explanation of
their popularity.
   <BR><A HREF="#02Q2">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="02Q2"></A> Clearly the introduction of computers has not had the dramatic effects
on measurable productivity and living standards that other comparable
technological revolutions have. We must understand why this is or ap-
pears to be true and also, if possible, why computers have nevertheless
become so popular, before we can move on to well-founded discussion
of where the trouble lies-if trouble there is-and what to do about it.
<P>
   The objective evidence seems quite at odds with the widespread per-
ception and advertisement of computers as effective productivity tools.
So on what are the enthusiastic opinions based? I believe they come
partly from commercial promotion and media hype, but primarily from
word-of-mouth testimonials by users. However testimonials, no matter
how earnest, are poor evidence; they can be found to support all sorts of
magical cures for cancer, ways to beat the stock market, or lose weight.

   <A NAME="022W"></A> The Card (1984) word processing study is an especially telling exam-
ple. Card, a leading expert in human-computer interface research and
design, as well as a regular computer user, initiated the research because
he shared the popular conviction that word processing greatly improved
productivity in document preparation. He was sure that Gould's earlier
negative results must have been a fluke or due to the use of a no-good
primitive text editor. He was confident that a well-done experiment using
the "vastly" better newer style of full-screen text editing would show
major advantages. He was wrong. The new style of text editing was only

marginally better than the old and did not provide a substantial
productivity benefit.
<P>
   The point is this: If such expert judgment can be so overoptimistic,
how much should we trust the testimonials of ordinary users? Still, it
seems that the conclusion that computers are failing us is against intu-
ition and common sense. In such a situation it is prudent to examine the
evidence very carefully, to see whether there is something wrong with the
data or inferences, whether there is not some more palatable explanation
of the facts. If we cannot outright explain away all the unwelcome evi
dence, then we ought to consider all plausible reasons for the phenome
non before looking for ways to deal with it. In the next two chapters, we
take these two routes in turn. Telegraphing my conclusion in the matter,
the first route, criticizing the evidence, is covered under the heading "ex
cuses"; while the second route, chasing down the possible real causes, is
treated under "reasons."

Given that the computer business has become a major industry, em-
ploying in one way or another well over a million people and causing
hundreds of billions of dollars a year to change hands, it's hard to accept
the implication that these machines bring no net improvement in eco-
nomic efficiency. Certainly they must be delivering something of value to
the millions of people plunking down hard cash for them. Since comput-
ers seem to have been designed and intended as productivity tools, to
help work get done more efficiently, productivity would seem to be the
first place to look. Thus it is tempting to try to find a way to deny appear-
ances. Here is a bunch of good tries.

Perhaps the easiest way out is to deny the conclusion and to assert that
despite the data, computers do or must contribute substantially to pro-
ductivity, or at least to net well-being. Three forms of this argument are
heard most often; one relies on the undeniable fact of computer power,
the second on the undeniable fact of computer popularity, the last on
proponents' undeniable personal enthusiasm.

   The most sophisticated form of this argument was put forward by
Stanford economist Timothy Bresnehan (1986). He says that when some
popular product starts out expensive and later becomes cheap, there is a
social welfare spillover; consumers reap the benefits. If because of techni-
cal or manufacturing improvements people now pay $1 for something
for which someone used to pay $11, the world must have gained $10 in
value received for each additional unit purchased at the new price. If we
multiply by ten the increased number of purchases at the $1 price, we
can calculate a welfare gain from productivity. Applying this reasoning
to computers, Bresnehan totes up how much the prices per million calcu-
lations per second (CPU power in megaflops, or MIPs) and per million
stored data items (memory size in megabytes) decreased between 1958
and 1972, using low and high estimates of 19 percent and 34 percent per
year price improvements. Bresnehan used purchase data from the finan-
cial services sector from 1958 to 1972, a period when regulatory and
business conditions in the industry were relatively stable, as was the basic
computer technology and its modes of application. Financial services, the
heaviest users of computers in those years, used computers operated by
service bureaus to do bookkeeping and record keeping. He multiplies the
number of new megaflops and megabytes of computer power delivered
to the industry each year by their price declines and comes up with an
enormous productivity improvement contributed to the overall economy.
By these calculations, the value added by computers was over five times
their cost. By extrapolation he concludes that "in current (1986) terms,
the downstream benefits of technical progress in mainframe computers
since 1958 are conservatively estimated at 1.5 to 2 orders of magnitude
[thirty-two to one hundred times] larger than expenditures.
   What should we make of this extraordinary conclusion? It certainly
paints a different picture from the superficial productivity and business
data and from the other econometric analyses as well. It finesses the use
of suspect measures that underestimate productivity in financial service
industries. However, the analysis has some glaring defects. First, consider
overall plausibility. If we update Bresnehan's figures to 1995 and extend
to all computer uses, and there is nothing in his logic to discourage us
from so doing, we get astronomical numbers. Total cumulative CPU and

memory purchases have mounted to well over $1 trillion, and their unit
price has declined by another factor of ten or fifteen. Following Bresne-
han's reasoning, the accumulated welfare benefit of computers in the
United States comes to at least $300 trillion, their current beneficence to
some $40 trillion a year, or over six times GNP. The average person's
real standard of living is seven times what it was in 1958 because of the
added pleasures and convenience of life supplied gratis by computers!
Bresnehan's method seems silly. Here is an only slightly facetious ex-
ample of where it could lead. In the late 1950s, all-aluminum skis came
on the market. They sold for approximately the same price as the best
wooden skis. Sales figures and race results showed that they were not
quite as good, and they eventually disappeared, but for a while they sold
quite briskly. A purchaser of aluminum skis would have fallen heir to
one of history's most remarkable productivity improvements. One hun
dred and fifty years earlier, the aluminum of which they were made
would have cost about $35,000 instead of $3. By Bresnehan's logic, this
saving in the manufacturer's potential cost was passed on as a welfare
benefit to each buyer. How I regret having bought wooden skis.
Let us apply this analysis more seriously to computers. Suppose my
new workstation were actually worth $50,000 in extra output from me
over its lifetime, and it cost my employer $10,000 to purchase and
$10,000 to support, for a net gain of $30,000. Fifteen years ago I could
have bought a maxi-mini and terminal with comparable capacity and
almost as good functions for, say, $200,000 purchase and $100,000 sup-
port, for a loss of $250,000 relative to my $50,000 increase in output.
Obviously a wise employer would have rejected my purchase request in
1980 but granted it with smiles this year. How much benefit has come
from the reduction in hardware costs? By Bresnehan's method, the an-
swer is the difference in price, $200,000-$10,000=$190,000. But it
seems much more sensible to credit the machine with only the
$50,000 - $20,000 = $30,000 net increase in output it is responsible for.
What happened to that big price decrease Bresnehan wanted to count as
a present to society? It never existed. My employer wouldn't have bought
me a computer at the higher price; it had negative utility. The "savings"
is totally fictional. It's a lot like the $100 my mother-in-law "saves" when

she pays $100 for a dress she would never have dreamed of buying at the
asserted "suggested retail" of $200.
<P>
   The same story applies to historical computer purchases in the finan-
cial service industries. In 1958, only the largest firms with the greatest
volumes and highest manual processing costs would have seen a gain in
buying computers (if such there was, as it turned out). Their net utility
for the purchase would be the cost savings from doing transactions with
their help. It might have been estimated at, say, 10 percent (we don't
really know; this is for illustration). For other firms, the net utility, given
the total costs of hardware, software, and fixed support expense, was
negative, and they sat on their hands. As hardware prices dropped, more
firms saw the same 10 percent positive margin and jumped in, so we get
the same gradual saturation of the market as the hardware component
of prices drops, and processing by computer gets cheaper than processing
by hand, but nowhere does the full difference between the old and new
price appear in anyone's pocket.
<BR><A HREF="#8338">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="8338"></A>

   The flaw in Bresnehan's calculation is not its underlying logic. Indeed,
applied to food or cotton thread, where the true value to the consumer
of the output is more obvious, and-at least in the short run-increases
in proportion to the amount of the goods a person can get her hands on,
I have no quarrel with it. The problem is in taking megaflops as the index
of utility. This is not what purchasers were buying. They were buying
computers to help with their businesses. By assuming a direct relation
between megaflops and "utility to someone" Bresnehan is able to com-
pute that "someone" must have gained a lot by the decrease in price and
increase in demand for megaflops. In a sense, this reasoning is circular.
Only if computation measured in megaflops is assumed to be directly
valuable to the world will Bresnehan's method tell us how valuable it
was.2

   Despite what advertisements claim, the proper measure of utility of a
computer is not its numbers of calculations and stored bytes but the
speed, convenience, and effectiveness with which it can serve some useful
purpose for the buyer. Flops and bytes are not even a computer's interme-
diate product-information-much less its economically meaningful
product-what can be done with the information. Most of the new ca-
pacity of PCs has been devoted to graphics and user interface improve-
ments, and these do improve their usefulness and usability somewhat.
The comparison between Gould's early and Card's later text editors, for
example, showed an increase in work efficiency of about 25 percent (but
none in letter quality) during a period in which byte and flop capacity
improved by at least 600 percent. Similar comparisons are sometimes
better but never by an enormous margin. Often poor or ill-aimed soft-
ware uses much more capacity to deliver the same information processing
functionality. For example, the search algorithms in most commercial
word processors need one hundred times the hardware capacity to de-
liver the same retrieval speeds as the algorithms used by Bellcore's
SuperBook text browser. In addition, new information processing func-
tions provided with new capacity are not necessarily of great value. Many
programs use the tremendous capacity lately available to offer computa-
tionally expensive, but for the user merely pleasant, graphic decorations,
or hundreds of features that are rarely used by anyone. Most computers
are never used at full capacity and are idle or lightly used most of the
time. Bresnehan's theory implies that computation itself was a valuable
end product, and that getting it cheaper was necessarily a boon. Not so.
Calculating the utility for price of computers that way is like valuing an
automohile by its engine's peak rpm-not even its horsepower-rather
than by its utility as a means of transportation and enjoyment.

stall massive record-keeping computer machinery. It was probably a mat-

service; the growth in customers and business was so phenomenal that it
would probably have been impossible to keep track of all the things that

of the large systems used by many other organizations whose information
work load has expanded enormously in recent years: banks, insurance
companies, airlines, stock and commodity markets, the IRS and the So-
cial Security Administration, for example. Certainly computers must be
just as critically useful and productive for them. But there is a danger
here of drawing a doubtful, circular conclusion. As Joseph Weizenbaum
observed in his influential 1976 book, Computer Power and Human Rea-
son, what such facts tell us is merely that these organizations could not
function the way they do today without computers-not that they could
not have found some other, perhaps equally satisfactory way to perform
equally valuable functions.3 Who is to say that the particular functions
firms have evolved based on heavy use of computers are better than oth-
ers that might have evolved in their absence? As we have seen, the overall
economic impact of the chosen course offers no stunning proof of its
superiority, so the mere fact that the large, complex organizations and
processes that exist today are dependent on computers does not prove
that the computers are productive. The huge pyramid building enter-
prises of ancient Egypt were as utterly dependent on enormous quantities
of slave labor as our own enterprises are on computers, yet few would
argue that slave labor must have been especially productive or that it
improved the lot of humankind.4
   <BR><A HREF="#0492">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="0492"></A> The argument from sales is equally seductive-and similarly fallacious.
It goes thus: Surely large, successful businesses would not have invested
billions, and continued to invest billions, if the technology was not a
boon to them. The argument begs the question, assumes its own answer.
By this line of reasoning, no business decisions, at least no consensual
decisions of the whole business community, can ever be wrong, and no
industry or national economy can suffer productivity stagnation or major
competitive losses.

   More pointedly, there are documented cases of widespread adoption
of technology that turned out to be unproductive. For example, in the
early 1980s (Baily and Chakrabarti 1988) the U.S. electric power indus-
try, for a few years a rival of telecommunications as an exception to the
productivity crisis, invested huge sums in two promising new kinds of
generating plants, supercritical steam turbines and nuclear. Both turned
out to be no more productive than their predecessors-the first because
they never operated reliably at predicted capacity and were unexpectedly
hard to maintain, the second because unanticipated technical and politi-
cal problems ballooned their construction and maintenance costs. We
cannot assume that a large investment is proof of its own economic
wisdom.

Many people are certain that computers are productive. Among them
are people who sell computers, ones who buy and use them, and many
who do computer research and development. It's probably best to ignore
the sales promoters, who may tend to exaggerate. (Following news of
the productivity paradox, software companies began advertising their
wares as "productivity tools.") The opinions of buyers and users are
more interesting, if fairly predictable. Those of professionals responsible
for the quality of computers should be the most objective and well articu-

convince me in the face of their obvious popularity, so I tried to calibrate
my attitude against those of colleagues in the computer business. My
area within computer science, human-computer interaction, is the fastest
growing subspecialty and arguably the one most closely involved with
issues of what computers are designed to accomplish, how well they can
be used, and with their design and evaluation from the user's point of

several thousand researchers and practitioners in the field-at various
conferences and meetings. Perhaps more interesting is a second effort. In
late 1990, I began an electronic discussion with two special subsets of
people in the field: an informal organization whose participants come
from about a dozen research laboratories, about half at universities and
half in industry, that are among the leaders in this field, and the group of
officers and volunteers who run an international professional organiza-
tion for this field-the Computer-Human Interaction Special Interest
Group of the Association for Computing Machinery-and its annual
meeting. Participants in both sets keep in touch by electronic mail. I sent
out a broadcast message briefly outlining the lack of evidence for produc-
tivity gains from computers and raising the issue of what they thought of
this-its validity and the reasons for it if true. In follow-up messages I
asked for any evidence of major productivity gains from applications of
computers.
   <BR><A HREF="#0563">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="0563"></A> The lively electronic mail discussion that ensued grew to include many
knowledgeable people around the world to whom the query was for-
warded. A certain number of my colleagues did not like my attitude;
they thought that computers are of such obvious and huge value that my
questions must be either frivolous or mischievous. Others took my ques-
tion in a different sense than I had intended, and described how decisions
about computer purchase and support are actually made in large organi-
zations (virtually never on evidence of productivity or profitability en-
hancement), how to market computer systems and what causes them to
be bought, or how to convince upper management in computer or soft-
ware firms that the added value of usability was worth the expenditure
to support people like us. Many offered examples of computer applica-
tions that they thought were superb and that they were sure must be great
productivity enhancers, although they admitted that they were unable to
marshal any hard data to support this opinion. (My own candidate in
this genre is electronic mail. The ability to have this wide discussion with
experts of all kinds from all over the world in a matter of days, to do it
all with little effort, and to have the results in a form that I can easily
search and edit seems utterly magical to me. It must be an enormous
boon to my productivity, although I have no evidence to prove it.) An-

quantitative proof of productivity gains was misplaced. The values of
computers are to be assessed some other way, they urged. Academic col
leagues stressed esthetic and scientific values and left me feeling rather
crass and commercial; business colleagues stressed competitive advan
tages and left me feeling hopelessly idealistic.
A few people raised examples of cases with apparently irrefutable eco
nomic value. In every instance, however, these cases had to be chalked up
as victories in automation or use of computers to do work that humans
couldn't. No one proffered solid cases with supporting data for augmen
tation tools, though these are the kinds of computer programs on which
my correspondents and their organizations all work and which are cur
rently needed for large productivity gains.
   The flavor of the debate is captured in some samples, somewhat para
phrased and interpreted by me, of this correspondence:

Macweek (March 13, 1990) that Peat Marwick, an accounting firm, be-
lieves its heavy use of computers is worthwhile but cannot document it,
Norman goes on to say, "We live in a society obsessed with quantifica-
tion, but we forget that in order to quantify one must extract the problem
and do some measure that can be counted . . . and quite often in doing
so, we have thereby lost the important aspect of the behavior. To quan-
tify the savings from computers is also to ignore the changes in morale,
in style, in kinds of [things] being performed that otherwise could have
not been done." Norman declares that he is not against quantification
and assessment; quite the contrary, he thinks they are very important.
However, he believes that good things are done that are hard to quantify

the absence of quantitative measures.

A committee of the National Research Council, the government and pub-
lic advising arm of the National Academy of Science, was commissioned
to "study the impact of information technology on the performance of
service activities." For a major portion of their evidence, the committee
conducted a survey of eighty high-placed executives from forty-six com-
panies in seven major service industries. The companies were chosen for
size, rate of growth, profitability, innovation, and heavy, reputedly effec-
tive use of IT. Just under half of the interviewed executives were chiefs
of computing divisions; most of the rest were CEOs. Their advice and
example on how to deploy IT is valuable. Unsurprisingly, only a few said
they had wasted their company's money on IT. A strong majority claimed
their returns were at least comparable to other investments.5 Here is a
sample of their comments-some positive, some not.

waste time trying to do it."

   By contrast, James Stewart, executive vice president and chief financial
officer of CIGNA Corporation, said, "I'm not yet convinced that dis-
persal and utilization of PC-based technology have proven to be efficient.

in the business world' which don't add up to measurable output or im-

<A NAME="0737"></A> What to Make of the Opinions
<P>
The more enthusiastic of the comments resemble the content of large
numbers of articles in computer and business magazines, as well as in a
plethora of advice books for managers. Most assert that computers are
of terrific value, and many appealing examples are offered, supported by
the author's experience and reasoned enthusiasm. I by no means deny
the truth of these claims. However, the well-known psychological phe-
nomenon of dissonance reduction-when people have invested heavily in
a decision, they are reluctant to judge it a failure-must be reckoned
with. So must the many failure stories and negative opinions, which off-
set the hopeful words and examples. The real problem is separating the
wheat from the chaff. If we judge on the basis of the overall economic
results of computers, the weighted sum of the effects of all systems put
together is near zero, so probably many are good, many are bad, and
many are neutral. In all likelihood the proportion of good ideas among
those testified to by experts is better than the average of ideas peddled.
But, especially in computer technology where hyperbole, fad, and unful-
filled predictions are as dense as pollen in September, there are too many
examples of highly touted and widely admired schemes that have turned
out to be losers to rest the case on expert testimonials.

than compensate for the cost of word processing equipment and cost

Measurement Problems
<BR><A HREF="#07X9">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="07X9"></A> Another appealing way to make the problem vanish is to reject the valid-
ity or importance of measured productivity. The recent National Re-
search Council reports rely heavily on this excuse to dismiss the
productivity paradox and turn to other questions. In essence they say,
"the productivity statistics are not entirely accurate, so we will discount
the hard-to-believe story they tell."
<P>
   Economists readily admit that productivity measures are sometimes
crude, indirect, and insensitive. One criticism points to the way that gov-
ernment agencies collect and analyze the data. The recent decrease in
productivity growth is primarily in service industries, and output in ser-
vices is especially hard to measure because the product does not stay the
same over time. Twenty years ago most banks were highly regulated,
ultraconservative holders of large savings accounts and reluctant lenders
to well-scrubbed borrowers. Now they are purveyors of vast quantities
of consumer, business, and real estate credit to the masses and managers
of huge pension funds. Are their earnings on deposits and loans paying
for the same services as they were of yore? How do you value the output
of insurance companies equivalently when they begin selling many more
different kinds of policies or of investment brokers when they move into
instruments like mutual funds? There are indeed great difficulties, suffi-
cient to cause one of the agencies that puts together these indexes, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, to throw up its hands in measuring some

industries, in particular financial services, for which it just equates output
with labor input. To pose the matter even more simply, what is the rela-
tive value of a cash withdrawal transaction with an ATM and with a
traditional teller? Suppose you're one of those who think that the ATM
provides more convenience or less waiting time. If a thousand ATM
money withdrawal transactions cost half as much in labor time and capi-
tal as a thousand teller money withdrawals, is "productivity" only dou-
ble? Suppose you prefer a human teller. Is the new service worth just half
the old?
   <BR><A HREF="#0816">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="0816"></A> What, exactly, is the product? The assessment of comparable output
is usually easier, more intuitively obvious, in goods manufacturing or
construction. The statisticians can count the "constant dollar" produc-
tion of 200-horsepower four-door passenger automobiles or 2000-
square-foot single-family houses. Of course, even that's not completely
straightforward. Automobiles added seat belts and fuel injection; houses
added double-glazed windows and central air-conditioning. Still, mea-
surement is obviously more slippery in services. Establishing the correct
constant dollar-that is, deflating the value of goods and services-is dif-
ficult as well. There is no guarantee that the same deflator (e.g., the Labor
Department's market basket measure) stays the same relative to different
products as the mix of products consumed by the public changes, or that
it is equally applicable to goods and services. In some studies, different
deflators are used for different industries; the opportunity for error is all
too apparent.
   <BR><A HREF="#0832">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="0832"></A> Maybe productivity has been improving in services as computers have
been brought in to help but hasn't been measured. Economists who have
studied and modeled service productivity have taken the matter seriously,
and most believe that there could be real unmeasured benefits of IT in
services, especially in financial services. However, most also agree that
mismeasurement cannot be the principal villain. John Kendrick, profes-
sor of economics at George Washington University, says, "Even after
allowances for understatement, however, it seems clear that productivity
growth in most services groups, other than communications and trade,
has been significantly below the U.S. business sector average" (Kendrick
1988). Edward Denison, senior fellow of the Brookings Institution
agrees: "I consider it unlikely that such [measurement] errors were large

relative to the observed change" (Denison 1989). The fact is that there
has always been a certain amount of slop and underestimate in measuring
services, but they used to show healthy productivity growth anyway. As
Roach (1988) says, "It seems an extremely remote possibility that the
service sector's productivity disappointments of the 1980s would disap-
pear if the numbers could, in fact, be corrected for statistical problems
that date back into the 1950s." The measurement problems don't appear
to be much different since the advent of computers.

Baily and Robert Gordon, of Northwestern University, who examined
the mismeasurement issue in detail (Baily and Gordon 1988), found fault
0 with many aspects of the standard measures of productivity, and with
the way constant dollars are sometimes computed as part of the process.6
For example, they note that BLS usually measures output in financial
services as equal to labor input; thus there can be no productivity gains.
To get a realistic but limited appraisal for this industry, Baily and Gor-
don studied the number of shares traded, and their total market value,
per worker in the security industry. Productivity measured in shares
traded grew strongly from 1965 to 1979; while measured in market
value, it declined. From 1979 to 1987 both measures showed very strong
growth-over 11 percent per year. They also looked closely at insurance
and banking and noted that government inflation adjustments probably
make insurance productivity figures look worse than they really are, and
that factors such as BEA's not counting credit card transactions in the
measure of checks handled cheated the banks a bit. They also found
problems with the accounting for airline transportation. However, most
of these measurement deficiencies existed before 1973, so they don't help
much to explain the post-1973 slowdown. (Indeed, for parts of the econ-
omy, productivity was more optimistically estimated after 1973 because

of changes in government statistical methods.) Putting all the evidence
together and adding a dollop of considered judgment, they conclude that
errors in measuring output did not contribute more than 0.2 percent to
the total growth slowdown.7

<P>
   One view of the measurement problem has been a particular favorite
of computer professionals: perhaps new ways of doing business create
value in the form of greater quality, convenience, or pleasure for consum-
ers without anyone's paying for it or BEA noticing. This conjecture was
also prominent in the National Research Council reports that dismissed
the productivity problem. Before examining the evidence more closely,
let us note what this hypothesis needs to explain. By 1995, the cumulative
shortfall in output-the total amount by which measured annual GNP
in the United States would have been larger if productivity growth had
continued at precomputer rates-is, conservatively, about $1 trillion per
year.8 That's roughly $4,000 per year for each man, woman, and child,
about half the average family's disposable income. Whether the increased
convenience and variety of products and services attributable to IT is
worth that much to the average person is a matter of opinion, but an
opinion that might be measured. We could roughly allocate the cost to
different products-banking, insurance, airline service-and ask those
old enough to remember whether the changes are worth their imputed
values. No one has done this. Instead reports like those of the NRC com-
mittees are sprinkled with anecdotes and testimonials by the people who
supply the services, and they tend heavily to cite quick loan approvals
and ignore the demise of price labels and telephone receptionists. The
most frequently cited examples of new service applications are airline
reservation systems and complex mutual funds. Unquestionably the res-
ervation systems have underwritten vast increases in air traffic. Dynami-
cally changing discount fare "yield management" systems keep planes
more fully occupied and total revenues higher. But I doubt that the cattle
car crowding, skimpy meals, crap-game fares, complex restrictions, and
multi-hop routes that have become part of the unmeasured quality of the

product are viewed by travelers as positive contributions to their pleasure
and ease. Unquestionably the number of shares and shareholders in mu
tual funds has increased enormously. Many people enjoy the opportunity
to choose among several hundred different funds, even if their perfor
mance is not reliably different from any other or as good as the market
average. But I have to wonder whether the touted competitive advantages
and increased pace of business and finance also attributed to comput
ers-things like mergers and leveraged takeovers-have not contributed
to the decreased stability of the blue-chip companies, the AT&Ts and
IBMs, that used to be havens for small investors.
   <BR><A HREF="#0912">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="0912"></A> Now let's look more directly at the evidence as to how much IT has
actually accelerated changes in service quality. The main changes claimed
by the defense are greater variety and convenience. For example, if con-
centrating everything anyone ever wanted in one giant supermarket, or
installing electronic checkouts, on average saves customers time, it might
be fair to count that time at some rate of pay. If customized insurance
policies are more valuable to buyers but no more expensive, it might be
fair to count the extra value as output. Still, this line of reasoning prests
several problems. First, almost all the trends that might be counted in
this column, such as self-service outlets, a greater variety of items under
one roof, and redesigned payment methods, were growing about as rap-
idly before 1973 as after (Baily and Chakrabarti 1988). For example, the
average number of items carried by supermarkets rose from 9,000 in

twenty-two years.9 Figure 4.1 shows the data in more detail. There has
been exponential growth in supermarket variety ever since World War II
but no sign of a change in the rate of growth since the computer age. Part
of the supermarket variety increases is due to improved preservation and
transportation that give us raspberries in the dead of winter and from
competitive strategies that proffer almost 200 varieties of breakfast ce-

flakes, at prices that include only about 10 percent for ingredients.l� In-
formation technology presumably contributed by making it easier for
stores to keep track of it all, thus helping the trend to continue. However,

   Second, there is a logical problem for basic economic theory in assum-
ing that businesses would choose to lower their productivity by giving
away all the fruits of technology. Indeed, a theoretical modeling effort by
Baily and Chakrabarti suggests that the apparent stagnation in services
cannot be accounted for by assuming that IT's benefit has all been passed
on gratis to consumers. The models indicate that the observed effects
could not result if IT was really reducing the labor needed to perform
work. I don't trust such disembodied economic theorizing very much,
but I also feel queasy about crediting the economy with large unmeasured
"convenience" values on the basis of informal impressions. While there
are ATMs and car reservation systems that offer improved consumer
convenience through computing, there are also those touchtone menu
telephone answering systems (if you want information on opening times,
touch 1; if you want to listen to Musak forever, touch 2; to enter 3, touch
5 . . .), and impersonal bill payment accounting systems (Dear BigCom-
pany: I've written explaining your error twice. Why is it still on the bill?).
   <BR><A HREF="#1020">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="1020"></A> Before explaining away the economic and profitability shortfall with
unmeasured customer service improvements, we should at least try to
measure them. For example, what is to prevent the BEA from asking
people how much they like the new financial services they are getting and
how much they would be willing to pay to get them back if they were
rescinded? 11 The fact that banks and brokers usually supply these conve-
niences "free," as marketing gimmicks rather than products with a price
tag, suggests that the answers would not always be overwhelmingly posi-
tive. In any event, the world, if not the producers of these systems, should
want service enhancements that increase real revenues or decrease costs
rather than just moving constant-value market share around.

   Whether IT, and the computer in particular, has had time to show its
stuff is open to debate. Some economists, for example, the Nobelist Leon-
tief (Leontief and Duchin 1986), have compared the computer revolution
to the industrial revolution, the building of national rail networks, or the
arrival of industrial assembly lines, all of which took many decades to
produce dramatic improvements in productivity. According to Franke,
fifty years passed after the introduction of Watt's steam engine in 1775
before substantial improvements in productivity, and he quotes Leontief
and Duchin's conclusion that "the introduction of mechanical power
continued to transform western economies and society over a period of
some 200 years. The computer revolution became visible only a few years
ago, and by the year 2000 it will be no more advanced than the mechani-
zation of European economies had advanced by, let us say, the year
1820" (Leontief and Duchin 1986) 12
   <BR><A HREF="#1059">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="1059"></A> A more recent precedent, the exploitation of electricity, is described by
Stanford economist Paul David (1990, 1991). Dating the industrial use
of electricity from the first dynamo installed by Edison in New York in
1881, he reports that demonstrable effects on productivity did not ap-
pear for over forty years, until the 1920s. But when they finally appeared,
they were substantial, contributing, he estimates, almost 2.5 percent per
year to a spurt in national productivity growth. What caused the delay
was slow diffusion due to ineffective early application and reluctance to
replace old plants and machines. He believes that productivity gains are
hard to see until about half the potential users have adopted a technology
and that this didn't happen with electric motors in manufacturing until
around 1920. Counting the beginning of computers from the first VLSI
devices about 1970, David likens our current perspective to that of an
observer of industry in 1900, and reckons that we shouldn't get impa-
tient with them for another twenty years.
<BR><A HREF="#10W5">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="10W5"></A> David's time comparison with IT is way off the mark. VLSI processors
and memory chips were a major step forward for computers but hardly
marked the beginning of their commercial use. Recall that by VLSI-time,
1970, there were already 125,000 computer operators and well over
$100 billion worth of IT in the United States. Even the electronic comput-
ing machines used by scientists, bomb builders, bankers, brokers, and
insurance companies in 1950 were further along the technological learn

ing curve than Edison's primitive direct-current dynamos and employed
some 900 operators.13 By 1980, every bank with more than one vice
president had a computer; David estimates that only 5 percent of manu-
facturers were using electric motors in 1900. A random sample of U.S.
firms found 100 percent using computers in 1992 (Kraut and Streeter in
press). David's divide of half adoption was well crossed by the mid-1970s
in the mass of companies large enough to have payroll or accounting
departments, and word processing had nearly reached that level as well.
A more realistic comparison would expect IT to have started raising pro-
ductivity statistics by 1975 if it had followed the electric motor's career
path.14
<BR><A HREF="#109Y">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="109Y"></A> But this is quibbling. Different technologies take different amounts of
time to mature. There is no reason that computers should take exactly the
same time as electric motors. David's main point is merely that superior
technologies do not increase productivity immediately, so the lack of an
effect now does not prove that there won't be one sometime.
<BR><A HREF="#RB3K">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="RB3K"></A> The effects of a superior technology on productivity growth are strong-
est during the diffusion period, as more and more firms start using it
(Kraut and Streeter in press). David's model puts the maximum growth
effects somewhere near the 70 percent adoption point. Since computers
have long since been almost universally adopted in commerce, the ines-
capable conclusion is that they are not yet superior.1s The question be-
fore us is when, if ever, will they become so? How long should we wait
for business as usual to make computer dreams come true?
<BR><A HREF="#11Q4">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="11Q4"></A> None of the historical analogies, even electric motors, is very helpful
here because we live in a different world. The rate of change in technol-
ogy, industry, and patterns of consumption is much faster now than dur-
ing the historical revolutions of the nineteenth century or the pre-World
War II era of the twentieth. We have much greater capital, labor, baseline
productivity, and market resources; a more widely educated population
(both workers and consumers); much improved means of communica-
tion; much cheaper and faster transportation; and dramatically better
scientific infrastructure and engineering methods with which to perfect
and bring technology to bear. In addition, we have different attitudes:
widespread expectation of miracles from technology have replaced nine-
teenth-century skepticism and turn-of-the century investment caution.

Thus the pace of refinement, adoption, and utilization of new technology
is much more rapid than was possible in earlier times. Witness the rapid
introduction of jet aircraft and the extraordinary growth rates of televi-
sion and other consumer electronics. The earlier technologies appealed
to in this excuse-railroads, steam engines, assembly lines, electric mo-
tors-took much longer to achieve full deployment. Moreover, the in-
vestment this time out looks enormously larger. Tens of trillions of
(1990) dollars were not pumped into any earlier technology before it
paid off, as Leontief's and David's projections would have us tolerate.
I doubt that 10 percent of England's GNP was being spent on not-yet
productively superior steam engines, or of the United State's on not-yet
superior electric motors and their operation, forty-five years after their
first commercialization, as was the case with computers.
   <BR><A HREF="#11T5">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="11T5"></A> Perhaps the size of the total investment in energy machines of all kinds,
canals and water-powered looms as well as railroads and steam engines,
during the first industrial revolution matched the current outlay for infor-
mation machines. Plausibly this is a better analogy and raises some inter-
esting issues. If we viewed the totality of the first industrial revolution as
equivalent to what is happening now, we would want to ask how we are
doing now relative to, say, forty or fifty years after the start of the earlier
boom. But when did that start? With the invention of the steam engine?
The automobile? The birth of commercial computers seems easier to
place. However, it is a mistake to view the computer as a single technol-
ogy. More appropriately, each major application is a new technology
harnessing information processing capability, much as the electric motor,
the locomotive, and the jet plane all harnessed energy-transforming capa-
bility.l6 Suppose we consider all the advances of the energy evolution as
one prolonged development. Would any forty or fifty years after intro-
duction of its major technological innovations, say from 1765 to 1810
(steam engine), 1865 to 1910 (steel, railroads, textiles), 1880 to 1925
(electricity generators), 1900 to 1945 automobiles, assembly lines), or
1935 to 1980 (airplanes, everything else), show the near-zero productiv-
ity growth in their primary sectors of application, let alone the total econ-
omy, that has occurred with information machines and the sum of all
their uses to date?

   Yes, it is too early to tell. It is too early to conclude that computers
will never bring improvements in work productivity, but it is too late to
be complacent. No logic compels every innovation, or every immense
investment, to improve productivity. Surely computer use is still in a
learning stage, still improving. Industry leaders are optimistic and believe
that businesses are beginning to use IT effectively. They point to exam
ples of major local gains from coordination and waste reduction. Crude
estimates suggest that the efficiency effects of text editing could be im
proving about two-thirds as fast as the very long-term averages for, say,
textiles.17 But these tantalizing hints and expressions of faith are not
enough. We have few repeated winners, few phase two applications with
as strong a claim as text editing. And surely we'd rather not wait fifty
years to see each application mature-if it does. We don't want to wait
as long as from the steam engine to the jet-200 years-for information
machines to complete their conquest. Our challenge is to foster faster
growth and learning, to make the technology pay off in our young pro
grammers' lifetimes.
<BR><A HREF="#11Y0">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="11Y0"></A> Coincidence
<P>
Another way to escape the conclusion is to assert that the evidence we
have considered is simply an accident or, rather, an elaborate set of acci
dents. Perhaps there are genuine and large effects on work efficiency, but
they are masked by other factors that happen to have reduced productiv
ity in just the same times and places that computers have increased it.
For example, the worldwide recession of the mid-1970s was very pro
nounced in the United States at just the time when productivity growth
took a downswing. Recessions cause productivity decline by softening
markets, leading to unused but still expensive production capacity. But
they also lead to labor force reductions, removing fat in payrolls, thus
increasing productivity, a proposition marshaled by Roach (1992b) to
sound a note of optimism for the 1990s.

<A NAME="122T"></A> experienced unusual woes in the last decade as a result of deregulation,
oil crises, and unlucky real estate deals. U.S. industry has suffered from
the gradual accretion of mountainous government reporting require-
ments regarding employment, safety, pollution, pensions, and taxes, all
of them piling nonpaying loads on management information systems. In-
deed, the finger of blame for low output figures has been pointed in many
different directions: labor recalcitrance, educational crises, management
greed, inflation, taxes, short-term business focus, the takeover craze, ser-
vice industry complacency, the low personal savings rate, the oil crisis,
unfair competition from the Japanese. Perhaps we could explain away
each and every time period, industry, and individual firm where comput-
ers have disappointed, an exercise that would leave as the only evidence
that computers haven't helped a handful of laboratory and field studies
showing limp efficiency effects of specific uses. This would be a slender
reed to stand against strong winds of favorable opinion. In the late
1970s, some economists gave serious consideration to the multiple-
causes explanation of productivity growth slowdowns, which the Los
Angeles Times labeled "the revised Murphy's Law-Everything that can
go wrong will go wrong at the same time." However, the doldrum has
persisted for another decade, and this mode of denial now requires so
many coincidences as to stretch credulity. As just one example, all the
negative factors would have had to be relevant to service industries (ex-
cept telecommunications)18 but not to manufacturing, and it doesn't ring
true; strikes, environmental impact statements, oil prices, foreign compe-
tition, and almost all the others have been at least as burdensome for
manufacturing.19
   <BR><A HREF="#1240">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="1240"></A> More telling, perhaps, are the quantitative analyses, which left a large
part, between 20 and 60 percent of recent productivity slowdowns unex-
plained. After a well-worth-reading examination of all the other factors
they consider credible candidates, Baily and Chakrabarti choose as their
prime suspect insufficient innovation of productive technology. Even
Denison (1983) conjectures that "slow . . . advance in knowledge itself,
and . . . the incorporation of knowledge into production" is a primary
cause. Since there was, in fact, enormous investment in information tech-
nology during this period, and relatively little in other innovation, espe-
cially in the service sector, it is nearly impossible to avoid the conclusion

that investment in information technology hasn't paid off in productiv
ity. Moreover, to explain away the studies that correlated investment in
IT with low productivity growth or return on investment in individual
firms, one would have to find some reason why highly computerized
firms were buffeted more strongly by other factors than were their more
conservative counterparts, and that in itself would be damning.
<BR><A HREF="#1284">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="1284"></A> Competitive Success
<P>
The next two excuses come from well-documented commercial accom-
plishments of computers. Several applications of computers have yielded
dramatic competitive advantages for the people who pioneered them.
ATMs provide a good example. They were introduced in large numbers
by CitiBank in New York, which as a result increased its market share
from 4 percent to 13 percent within a very short period of time. A direct
order entry system introduced by Blue Bell, manufacturers of Wrangler
jeans, by which their retail outlets could instantly respond to fluctuating
consumer style demands, resulted in a large increase in business,
amounting to some 13 percent of their total revenues. When Merrill
Lynch was the first to introduce a cash management account for its cus-
tomers, a very elaborate computerized system that required 100 pro-
grammer years to construct, it attracted large numbers of accounts from
other brokerage houses.
   <BR><A HREF="#1279">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="1279"></A> In all of these examples, the other major players in the same markets
fairly soon followed suit, and some or all of the initial market advantage
dissipated. However, that's not the real issue here. The issue is whether
the use of computers as instruments of strategy for gaining market share,
that is, shifting sales from one company to another increases productiv-
ity. In the case of ATMs, there seem to be contradictory data and opinion
as to whether they have brought about any net improvement in produc-
tivity for banks. At least for small banks early on, the cost of installing
and maintaining these devices was more than the labor saving that they
provided (Brand and Duke 1982). When installed beyond bank lobbies,
they can entail substantial real estate costs and require expensive support
by relatively high-paid technical personnel not needed for human tellers.
It is obvious that ATMs have provided something that some customers

wanted-some mix of convenience, longer banking hours, and novelty.
People apparently make more frequent but smaller withdrawals from
ATMs than from tellers (Brand and Duke 1982). My wife chooses the
ATM in the bank lobby over the human teller, even when there's a line
for the ATM but not for the teller. She says ATMs are more fun than
writing checks.
   <BR><A HREF="#13P4">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="13P4"></A> Support of successful competitive strategy alone does not necessarily
constitute evidence of productivity. It is possible that ATMs could have
increased the productivity of users, if not of the banks. For example, if
ATMs free people's time for more productive work, total GNP might
have reflected it, but possibly in such a small way as to be invisible. Per-
haps ATMs are generating a pure welfare benefit, as economists call it,
in which the investment is good for the world but not necessarily for the
company or the economy as measured by paid-for output. An example
of a welfare investment is industrial air pollution abatement (although
this presumably has some long-term payoff in reduced medical bills,
lower agricultural costs, and other human benefits). We could postulate
that computers and information technology are in large part simply mak-
ing life better without making it more productive. When a government
invests extra money in the routing of a superhighway to make it more
scenic, the goal is not higher GNP but greater satisfaction of the citizenry.
ATMs may be a similar product. The increased convenience and avail-
ability of cash, and the fun of operating a simple device that hands over
money, might well be expected to make ATMs popular even if they had
no productivity consequences at all-that is, provided that they did not
cost banks enough money that a competitive advantage could be gained
by doing away with them and reimbursing customers for the loss with
higher interest rates or lower fees.
   <BR><A HREF="#132W">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="132W"></A> Consider this: There is no reason that ATMs and similar service prod-
ucts that are good, not because they reduce business costs but just be-
cause people like them, should not show up as productivity gains. If
people like them enough, they should be willing to pay for their use; the
service feature should become a new product. If the new product is being
produced at low cost relative to what people will pay-for example, in
the fees that some banks charge for ATM transactions or in lower interest

rates that customers will tolerate-then the industry's ledger sheet should
show a productivity gain.
<P>
   On the other hand, services like this could attract customers from one
provider to another with no effect on productivity at all. Advertising is
generally considered to be largely such a service. Imagine a hypothetical
computer system that produces better decisions on plays for a football
team. The team might win more games as a result, but overall productiv-
ity in the football industry (the gross per player salary megabuck) will
not depend on which football team is the most frequent winner. In a
similar manner, leveraged takeovers of companies, by focusing on short-
term financial gains for stockholders, can be construed as winning for
someone, but they may have negative effects on long-term productivity.
Perhaps the game metaphor is more apt than might appear. As an econ-
omy gets closer and closer to having all the goods and services that people
really need or want, more and more of peoples' proportional effort might
come to be devoted to just playing competitively, either for the sheer joy
of competition or to see who gets the greater share of the pie. Other
countries than the United States may be improving their productivity rel-
atively more by the use of technology, such an argument would go, be-
cause they are not as far along on the economic success curve and are
thus still devoting more of their energies to greater efficiency and less to
the market share game.
   <BR><A HREF="#13V3">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="13V3"></A> Another area of documentable success for computers is in inventory
and resource management. Bookstores, for example, have made effective
use of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs), bar codes, and
computers to allow them to stock only popular books and keep on hand
only enough of each title to meet day-to-day needs. Ignoring the fact that
this use has made every chain book outlet a twin of every other and left
customers with a greatly impoverished list of titles from which to
choose-a decrease in public welfare presumably-the retail book trade
has reputedly increased its productivity. Similar stories are told about
manufacturing resource planning (MRP), in which the raw materials,
piece parts, and flexibly assigned labor are all kept track of and mar-
shaled in minimal numbers at just the right time so that capital is not
unnecessarily tied up in unused resources. Borg-Warner is said to have

increased productivity by 20 percent by such means. The consulting com-
pany Booz Allen has been quoted as saying that such techniques can yield
up to 29 percent gains in profits for many manufacturing companies.
Better management of capital should improve multifactor productivity,
if not labor productivity directly. The mystery is why these effects are not
more prominent. There have been healthy improvements in productivity
in manufacturing in the last twenty years, possibly-despite Loveman's
(1986) data to the contrary-due in some part to such computer-based
methods. However, manufacturing has shrunk to a small part of overall
economy, so these gains may not have greatly affected the overall mea-
sures at which we looked. Retail trade, however, has continued to experi-
ence productivity losses. Perhaps inventory control techniques such as
those instituted by bookstores have been insufficiently adopted (although
the ubiquity of bar codes and scanners suggests the opposite), have too
small an effect on the average, or are being counterbalanced by other
forces.
<BR><A HREF="#1314">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="1314"></A> We've Come About as Far as We Can Go
<P>
Another possible out is to believe that productivity, at least in the United
States, has topped out or come close. As in the case of direct labor costs
for manufacturing, the total contribution to the economy has shrunk
drastically, so little overall effect can be felt by improvements here. How-
ever, jobs in the service industries-financial services, marketing, design,
advertising, engineering, maintenance, customer service occupations-
which have grown apace as manufacturing has declined, are associated
with relatively low productivity and slow productivity growth. Is it possi-
ble to believe that these too have topped out on productivity? Normally
we'd expect a sector with low baseline productivity to provide much
greater opportunity for improvement. But with some rather fanciful ar-
guments, we can hypothesize the opposite in this case. Suppose that most
of these service jobs are ones whose dollar value is defined directly as
personal labor. For an example, consider babysitting. You hire a sitter
by the hour to keep a watchful eye on one or more small children. Excep-
ting some farfetched notions of robotics or telepresence, there is no way

<P>
Stephen Roach (1992a) offers another, rather imaginative, rationaliza-
tion. He suggests that the vast computing resources acquired by business
in the 1980s and 1990s were grossly underutilized because there was so
much regulation, so little competition from abroad, and such easy success
that managers just didn't care about productivity. Says he, "The technol-
ogy paradox is traceable to the service sector's legacy of complacency
and inefficiency." Although a great fan of Roach (he has done much to
open eyes to the computer paradox), I find this one hard to swallow.
Roach's main evidence is a reduction in "back office" white-collar job
growth in the first part of 1992, which he attributes to mergers of large
banks and subsequent consolidation of back-office processing capacity.
One reason why I am so doubtful of his conclusion is that it seems highly
unlikely that banks actually had large excess processing capacity. "Siz-
ing" of computer systems for such operations is a fairly accurate engi-
neering art, especially when the processing load grows gradually over
time. In telephone office business support systems, for example, capacity
is usually stretched to near its limit (Srinivasan, 1992); it is often impossi-
ble to add even a modest new software feature without first adding more
computer power. That large and growing firms would have enough ca-
pacity to spare for consolidation to make a big difference in hardware
requirements is not credible. Indeed, studies in the mid-1980s found no
cost savings from bank mergers (Srinivasan 1992). As of this writing it is
impossible to tell whether the 1992-1994 "restructuring" of the U.S. ser-
vice business (economists' euphemism for permanent layoffs) will con-
tinue, will result in genuine and lasting productivity gains, especially ones
that combine increased output with strong employment and high wages

as in the past, or will turn out to be a temporary cost-cutting binge that
will leave the economy weakened and well-being diminished. Only time

   My second reason for doubting the "complacency" hypothesis is that
I see no evidence or basis for the existence of complacency or its complic-
ity in underuse of technology for productivity. Although regulation and
weak foreign competition in some parts of the service industry may have
had some local moderating effects on the pitch of activity, there has cer-
tainly been enough incentive to keep management in hot pursuit of pro-
ductivity improvements. There has obviously been vigorous pursuit of
market share, for example, even in banking; witness ATMs and overdraft
accounts. And surely increased productivity-the sword the Germans
and Japanese used to maim the American steel business-is in itself a
highly effective competitive tool. Wouldn't domestic service firms have
used it on each other if they could? Moreover, in the most tightly regu-
lated, least competitive sector of the service industry, the telephone busi-
ness, productivity improvements continued at a normal clip. Disincentive
effects of regulation and weak competition won't do as explanations.

We have now reviewed all the plausible ways to convince ourselves that
there really is no computer productivity problem. Each is seriously want-
ing. And even if all of these objections and excuses were to be rather
generously credited, they are not sufficient to undo the conclusion that
something is wrong with computers. Surely there is plenty and more
room for greater efficiency in the white-collar and service sectors of the
economy. There must be many ways to make the provision of building
maintenance, retail customer services, hospital care, hotels stays, car
washes, restaurant meals, doctors' exams, lawyers' advice, and health
club workouts more labor and capital efficient. But somehow these jobs
seem not to be getting more productive very fast. Why haven't phase two
computer applications done something to aid this majority part of our
economy? Surely there is a great deal of profit and glory to be accrued by
inventors and suppliers of technology to enhance productivity in these

programs for PCs were as wonderful as their devotees would have us

hundreds as the inventions of the industrial revolution did, they would

<A NAME="15SR"></A> I picked up a couple of bikes that had been repaired by a shop I've dealt
with for many years. The proprietor and an assistant spent a good five
minutes entering a record of the work and parts and presented me with
an impressive two-page receipt and a ticker tape listing items like "067-
deraileurred bike" and "2141abor UPS." Gesturing at the sales com-
puter, the proprietor-unsolicited-said, "Boy this thing produces

   Buying computers and related technology appears to be about 13 per-
cent less productive for business than average capital investments. Ex-
penses for computing to date total up to over $4 trillion. Duly
compounded, over $3 trillion seems to have been misplaced.

   <A NAME="1540"></A> Where did all the money go? Was it just thrown away, the capital
goods scrapped? To some extent, yes. Computer hardware and associ-
ated software depreciate quickly-many R&D organizations use a three-
year depreciation for internal accounting purposes-partly because
computers are somewhat fragile but mostly because of the astonishing
rate at which the technology has advanced. Computer models can be-
come obsolete in as little as three years. Rapid obsolescence brings not
just the temptation to replace still-working machines with ones that are
more powerful but often is required because the hardware is no longer
supported by the manufacturer, desired new software won't run on the

ness.
<BR><A HREF="#1659">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="1659"></A>
Similarly, the cost of operating computers, of making them useful,
is very high. By the mid-1980s, almost 2 percent of the U.S. Iabor force
was producing or repairing software, an activity most of which is not
directly productive. Computerizing demands new expert labor to help
users get information in and out of the whirring boxes and to retrain and
coordinate all the users and helpers. Thus, there are many money leaks
in the system. Another possibility is that sufficient revenue increases or
cost savings were just never there. Excepting scientific applications, Nin-
tendo, and a few other cases, computers usually don't produce anything
of direct value. Their output is information, usually a strictly intermedi-
ate product, which becomes valuable only when used to reduce the costs
or increase the value of some other product for which people are willing
to pay. A computer is thus something like a lathe used to manufacture
machine tools; its output is another tool. A computer's economic impact
depends on the usefulness of the tools it produces. We have seen little
evidence that such tools are markedly superior to their predecessors.
<BR><A HREF="#1573">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="1573"></A> A very cautious conclusion for what has been said so far is that com-
puter technology has failed to yield adequate labor productivity improve-
ments, especially in the increasingly important nonmanufacturing
portion of the economy, where investment in IT is dominant. Computers,
as powerful information processing devices, would appear to be the right
tools for achieving this goal. The need is apparent, and the economic
rewards would be large. People in all parts of the computer business have
hoped and intended to achieve this goal. So we must ask what has pre-
vented success.

Most phase two computer equipment is aimed at offices and office work-

writers and file cabinets-even discount PC clones can appear quite
expensive. Since the mid-1970s, when dreams of automated, paperless

a set of dumb terminals would have cost $10,000 to $20,000 per station
(in 1990 dollars). A current high-end setup might have color graphics
PCs or Macintoshes interconnected by Ethernet or equivalent local area
network and supported by a file server machine with a few gigabytes of
storage (about ten to twenty four-drawer paper files worth). It might
cost $3,000 to $10,000 per station.1 The initial outlay for equipment is
compounded by substantial expenses for equipment maintenance, soft
	ware purchase, customization and updating, operation, and, especially,
user training and support. It's a rather interesting sidenote to this whole
story that typists and secretaries who use word processors command
higher salaries than those who use ordinary typewriters. It appears to
take more training and skill to use this "aiding" technology than to do
without.
   <BR><A HREF="#161Q">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="161Q"></A> Thus, if there are only modest productivity gains to be realized with
computerized of fices, their payoff is likely to be somewhat long term and
uncertain. Business has been repeatedly faulted for failure to make long
term investments in productivity-enhancing technology. The authorita
tive summary issued by the MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity
(Dertouzos, Lester, and Solow 1989) concurred with many before in
blaming shortsighted investment policies for the flight of steel, semicon
ductor, and consumer electronics, among others, from America to Japan.
American managers get their rewards primarily for good short-term per
formance-quarterly or annual-and have little motivation to make
large commitments to methods that may take as long as ten years to pay
off. Perhaps this factor has contributed to the problem. If many more
industries had had even more computing technology more widely de
ployed over a longer period of time, there would have been even more
opportunity for it to evolve, for effective uses to have been invented,
sorted out, and amplified, and for less valuable ones to be discarded.
In Japanese business, reluctance to make long-term investments does
not provide an adequate explanation for the failure of computerization
to yield productivity gains. But the Japanese may have had insufficient
time, since the problems of fitting PCs to their writing systems and work
norms has inhibited the spread of information technology in offices, as
well as the fact that they are still well behind America in exploiting the
older and more proved techniques of productivity enhancement.

Slow Learning
<P>
The story with electric motors was that at first people substituted them
for steam engines and waterwheels driving the shafts and pulleys that
transmitted energy over factory floors. Electric motors weren't especially
good at that-too low powered, too energy inefficient. Then engineers
figured out that they could attach a small motor to each machine and use
wires instead of cumbersome shafts and pulleys to distribute energy in
the factory. They could even make machines that workers could lift,
move, and hold. This learning took about twenty years (David 1990;
Mokyr 1990), but the rate of learning for electric motors was seriously
inhibited by slow adoption. By comparison, the learning of productive
computer applications appears severely retarded.
   <BR><A HREF="#1653">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="1653"></A> Why so slow? We don't know. Are we now on a faster learning curve
at last? It is impossible to tell. We simply don't have the data. Some
crude, fragmentary evidence suggests some acceleration, but my impres-
sion is that overall progress remains sluggish. Yet even if we were learn-
ing at the speed of electric motors or steam engines, we'd be in trouble.
This is the post-jet age.

Rapid Change and Incompatibility
<BR><A HREF="#1673">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="1673"></A> The market for phase two computer equipment contains a bewildering
array of machines, systems, and software, most of which require a great
deal of scarce expertise to select and connect and which are often incom-
patible with most of the others. (In a Rand Corporation survey, 79 per-
cent of computerized offices used equipment from more than one vendor,
32 percent from four or more.)

   Putting together an office computing environment is not like assem-

decide to buy a UNIX operating system on its reputation for software

be used together; you'll have to buy a new computer as well. If you are
foolish enough to buy two or more different kinds of desktop computers
for your staff, say Macintoshes for some and IBM clones for others, the
expensive software that you buy for one will not operate on the other.
Rarely will this year's new program run with a six-year-old operating
system (the basic software that reads, writes, and manipulates the bits)
or a ten-year-old machine. A new program may not even operate on
last year's model of the same machine. And yet every few years each soft-
ware package will be "updated" to one with more features and different
bugs. You hardly dare pass up the relatively inexpensive update pack-
age lest the next generation leaves yours obsolete, incompatible, and
unsupported.

   <A NAME="16Y5"></A> Many of the most promising uses of computers and communications
gear lie in connecting workers to each other and to common repositories
of data and information. However, because they can't afford the consid-

inefficiency of this situation greatly inhibit the exploitation of informa-

One day a few years back I arrived, weary and bedraggled, infant in

   The fact is that computers as we mostly know them, the ones that are
used as phase two productivity tools in business, are highly unreliable.
The hardware is forever crashing unexpectedly; the software is full of
bugs that cause errors, unexpected glitches, and complete shutdowns.
(When a software malfunction causes the machine to completely stop
responding, it is said to "hang". An appropriate fate, I sometimes think.)
Unreliability isn't a necessary condition of computers. The computers
used to switch telephone calls or to control highly critical and dangerous
military applications have been built to have virtually errorless operation
over years of service. But such reliable computers are extremely expen-
sive. Ones that are practical as work tools have poor reliability compared
to the methods that they have replaced.
<BR><A HREF="#174S">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="174S"></A> Reluctant Labor
<P>
On some occasions in some industries, organized labor has resisted the
institution of computer-based methods, or at least made their introduc-
tion more expensive than they might otherwise have been. Perhaps the
earliest and best example is the printers' and compositors unions' in New
York, which at first fought and then cooperated with the movement to
replace manual typesetting machines with computer-based systems. The
compromise solution was a guarantee that the improved productivity
would be realized not through layoffs but only through natural attrition,
an approach widely used in Scandinavian and other European countries.
   <BR><A HREF="#1755">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="1755"></A> The resistance of labor to labor-saving devices surely increases the dif-
ficulty and expense of introducing them. But this is not an insurmount-
able or permanent obstacle. New technology has always managed to
make its way when its value is large and obvious. Record-high labor costs
and work restrictions in West Germany, for example, do not prevent the
textile industry there from being the third largest in the world as the
result of imaginative use of technology and management innovations.

Indeed, it can be argued that the very contentment and cooperativeness
of the highly unionized, highly protected, and highly paid labor force has
been an integral and necessary part of Germany's productivity improve-
ments. Labor and other groups in the United States have tried, and in
some cases succeeded, in having laws passed that regulate and restrict
the use of computers or the conditions of their use. Thus, although the
proportion of American industry that is unionized has declined greatly,
there is still a real, although small, inhibitory effect of labor resistance.

<A NAME="1798"></A> Computer Illiteracy
<P>
It is often asserted that one of the problems with computers is that too
few people know how to use them. The population is accused of being
computer illiterate. When calls are made for schools to provide better
education in computers, it's not clear what is in mind. Almost all the uses
that might improve productivity require operators to interact only with
programs, not to write programs of their own. Should schools teach stu-
dents to operate word processing systems or use spreadsheets? If so,
which programs? (There are many of versions of each, each rather differ-
ent from most others.) Fortunately evidence shows that learning one
word processor makes it easier to learn another, no matter how different
they appear (Singley and Anderson 1985). As long as the technology is
not changed too fast and the important applications next year are not
too different from this year's, training in high schools and colleges could
certainly increase the utility of computers in business.
   <BR><A HREF="#1793">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="1793"></A> Businesses relied on high school typing classes to make typewriters use-

   It's interesting to note, as an aside, the important role of typing in the
use of computers. There is almost no serious computer application that
does not require the user to type (the recent short-lived hoopla over pen-
based computers notwithstanding). This is one reason why few gray-
haired male executives have computers on their desks. Wizard computer
programmers tend to be extremely fast typists-it has been said that pro-
fessional Mac programmers typically type 75 to 125 words per minute

Management advisers such as Drucker (1991), Scott-Morton (1991),
Strassmann (1990), and Dertouzos, Lester, and Solow (1990) agree that
the effective use of information technology, and increased productivity
in information age industries, will depend on major changes in the way
businesses are organized. In particular, many call for a flattened hierar-
chy of authority. Rapidly changing technical content, tools, and skills
will require a "more involved, less specialized, continuously learning
work force" (Dertouzos, Lester, and Solow 1990). Such people will be
highly valuable specialists who must be given adequate authority and
access to the parts of the organization that depend on them. In turn,
the increased flexibility and directness of the communication tools that
information technology provides make obsolete the deep hierarchical
command and control structures that originated in preelectronic military

   In spite of much talk along these lines and spasmodic dumping of mid-

industrial organizations seems to have occurred yet. For example, from
the first quarter of 1992 to the first quarter of 1993,400,000 new mana-

Overuse
<P>
Many experts speculate that IT's failure is largely due to its use in gener
ating ever greater amounts of expensive but insufficiently useful manage
ment information. Once a computer is in place and all of a company's
inventory, sales, and expense data are available for electronic access and
manipulation, the opportunities for analysis are dizzying. Managers can
see where the money is coming from and going to; they needn't guess
how much xerography is costing them even if its expense is dispersed in
a hundred different departmental budgets. But, as often happens, true
opportunities hatch false temptations. If the data needed for an analysis
are there, why not do the analysis? If it seems that someone might be
able to use it, go ahead. If a manager requests a figure, write the program
to report it. Once the program has been written, why not report the result
every month? Every manager now gets reports measured in stack-feet per
month. Nobody can read it all or digest what they've read. My group
once worked on a project to sort through a two-inch-thick daily printout
to find and display the few lines that were useful to the manager to whom
it was provided. According to one commentary, "It looks as if the admin-
istrative bureaucracies have swallowed a large share of total investment
without making corresponding improvements" (Baily and Chakrabarti
1988).

   <A NAME="1878"></A> If substantial programmer and MIS department time goes into exces
sive report production, even greater excesses probably happen in individ

individual manager can now track results of her own operation without
hassling with and waiting for the MIS department. She can see what
would happen to the bottom line if she added 10 percent to every expense
account as requested by the sales force. But she can also spend the after
noon on computer daydreams calculating her bonus if sales are at the
minimum, maximum, or average of what each salesperson predicts. Un
doubtedly, many times as many financial analyses are being conducted
as before, many on different data-some worthwhile, many not, many
repeating each other, few shared widely. The MIS department is redun
dant in much of what it does, except that reconciling, merging, and tak
ing advantage of all those separate analyses is virtually impossible, so a
central job for the whole company is still needed.

ronmental protection guidelines, and a zillion other things. Strassmann
(1990) estimates that 3 percent of employee wages goes into tax re-
porting. A substantial fraction of this amount must be the result of op-
portunities for analysis and report made attractive by computers and
accomplished with them.
   <BR><A HREF="#19P9">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="19P9"></A> It is a bitter irony. If reporting had been kepr simple, computers might
have made its labor costs nearly vanish. As it is, much of the increased
computer capacity of many firms is occupied with these activities.3 Many
forests have given their lives to the cause. Just mailing the reports to
Washington and Sacramento must cost enough to notice. I doubt if any-
one reads them, but many are paid to file them.

Underuse
<BR><A HREF="#19R9">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="19R9"></A> My favorite example of underuse comes from a speech by Michael Der-
touzos to a group of industrial supporters of MIT's graduate programs in
the spring of 1992. He pointed out that computer processing has greatly
speeded the handling of checks by American banks through magnetic ink
readers to identify the payer and the payer's bank, and speedier, lower-
cost bookkeeping and transfer operations. However, there are still at
least two points in each check's life when human labor is used: when the
issuer, if an individual, writes the check and enters it in a checkbook and
when someone transcribes the amount from the face of the check into a
computer. Until these costly parts of the process are eliminated, doing
business by check remains expensive. In France, far fewer transactions
are done by check, many more by direct funds transfer, and the cost of
money transactions is much lower (McKinsey Global Institute 1992).

   I heard Malcolm Forbes Jr. interviewed on PBS about the future of the
American economy. He waxed enthusiastic over the coming benefits of
information technology using as his prime example Wal-Mart. Once, he
said, it used IT to detect that a major competitor was out of stock on
blankets and instantly raised its own prices.
<BR><A HREF="#19U8">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="19U8"></A> The most serious complaint about computers, at least by those who are
concerned with productivity, is that their primary role has been to sup-
port merely redistributive marketing and financial activities. Almost all
the commentators cited up to now point fingers at this problem. We've
looked at several examples already-for instance, the ATM case and the
explosion of insurance policy and bank account varieties. The complex
fare schedules for airlines are another example. Impossible without com-
puters, these schemes, which can involve tens of thousands of different
fares for one airline's various flights, have been credited with improving
the competitiveness of many (some now failing since they all started do-
ing it) airlines while offering great variety and savings (when you can get
them) to customers. However, some airlines have switched back to sim
pler fare schedules, advertised as more convenient and less expensive.
Computer-managed stock trading programs that try to capitalize on mi
nute-by-minute changes in prices are another example of using expensive
hardware and programmers to move money from one pocket to another
without producing anything.

<P>
Computer equipment is hard to choose, install, maintain, and, especially,
operate. The flexibility of digital computing equipment, the fact that it
can be redesigned to be operated in just about any way anybody would
wish, that it is not constrained by mechanical limitations, should make it
infinitely easier to use than past technologies. Mysteriously, this opportu-
nity has not been grasped. Computers are widely viewed as arcane, com-
plex machines that only smart, technically oriented people are
comfortable with. In principle, a computer attached to a typewriter
should make it easier to learn to type and easier to produce letters and
other documents. It is anomalous that typists need to go back to school
to learn to use a word processor. Something has gone seriously off track.
Since most of the rest of this book attacks this problem, I'll save the
details for later.

<A NAME="20S5"></A> Standardization
<P>
A part of the unusability of computer systems is lack of standardization.
No two word processing or text editing systems, of the dozens available,
no two database query languages of the scores available, no two spread-
sheets work in the same way. The way to load a diskette or log on is not
the same on one computer as the next. Because most people tend to work
with the same computer frequently over a long period of time, they can
usually adjust to superficial idiosyncrasies without enormous effort.
More serious is that different programs, called "applications" (for "ap-
plications of the computer"), on the same machine use different terms,
require different actions for the same results (k for "kill" or k for
"keep"), have the options of their menus differently labeled; organized,
and located. The same icon has different meanings (a circle might mean
"draw a circle" or "grab everything in this circle"); different icons are
used with similar meanings (the coffee cup, clock, or hour glass for "the
computer is busy"). Incredibly, these "features" are sometimes pat-
ented-tantamount to patenting the words of English and expecting
speakers to observe proprietary claims as well as correct grammar. The
way a user finds a file, determines available storage space, moves or re-
sizes a "window," and every other operation changes not only from one
computer to another but from one program to another, even on comput

ers with the best reputations for friendliness. When an office has several
different machines and personnel with varying backgrounds, the situa-
tion gets ludicrous. Scores of different programs are needed. One person
can't pass a document file to another without a special conversion pro-
gram: a veritable tower of babel. The personnel department now asks
clerks not if they can type but what word processor they know and hires
only those intimate with the local species.
<BR><A HREF="#20X6">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="20X6"></A> Complexity
<P>
Almost all software systems are arcane and complex. The user manuals
accompanying even the smallest and simplest user-oriented systems are
thick volumes. With a few of the very best brands, it is possible to unpack
the machine from the box and do a few trivial, if pleasing, computer
tricks (like typing something, filing it, and getting it back on the screen)
within fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, anyone who wants to do serious
work needs to devote significant amounts of time to learn how to use the
machine. I've watched professional computer scientists come up to speed
with new Macintosh computers-reputed to be the easiest, most trans-
parent ones around. Only after days of concentrated effort can they do
useful work, and months pass before the presumed advantages of their
new toy are experienced as an advance over the system they used last.
The excuse is that these systems are so rich, so powerful, have so many
nifty features, that to master all of them, or even some of them in the
context of all the others available, is necessarily difficult-but worth it.
Fans also sometimes assert that knowing other systems rots one's mind,
makes it harder, not easier to get good with a wonderful new one. But
this is balderdash; such "negative transfer" has never been documented.
   <BR><A HREF="#205X">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="205X"></A> The real problem is simple enough: the systems are not simple enough.
They are too complex, have far too many features, give the user far too
many options. Almost all users use their computer for only a few opera-
tions. Nevertheless, their machines and minds are loaded up with a vast
junk pile of options, commands, facilities, doodads, and buttons, most
of them superfluous to the user and there just because somebody knew
how to program it. Having this mountain of stuff available usually means
that doing even the simplest operation can be extraordinarily difficult.

Usefulness

<A NAME="209Z"></A> Worse, much worse, than the sheer difficulty of operating today's com-
puters is the minute number of truly useful things that they make possi-
ble. Computer designers and devotees will protest this assertion loudly,
claiming, with some truth, that they use their computers for scads of
things, and use them effectively. However, it remains to be shown in
most cases that the things that they do with their computers are actually
being done dramatically better or faster than they are being done by the
computer deprived. More important is the fact that ordinary users of
computers, people who have other jobs to do than use computers and
really want tools, not computers, rarely use more than a very small hand-
ful of the hundreds of features and functions that have been designed
and marketed. By and large, PC users use word processing programs,
spreadsheet programs, or database programs. Many of them use only one
of these functions; rather few use them all. Some 10 percent of PCs, those
equipped with modems and communications software, are sometimes
also used for sending and receiving electronic mail. Recently many man-
agers and professionals have begun to use drawing programs to produce
transparencies with some graphical content other than typescript. Leav-
ing aside powerful but highly specialized uses by engineers (CAD-CAM)
and scientists (e.g., Mathematica, numerical simulation), that is the sum
and substance of the useful things now widely being done with personal
computers. Add the accounting, record keeping, billing, and payroll cal-
culations usually done with minis or mainframes, and you've about cov-
ered the waterfront. But you haven't even touched, much less provably
helped, most of the work of most of the people in the service economy.

inal intent was lost track of. Certainly no effective method for finding
out whether the system performed its desired function was in place.
<BR><A HREF="#JE5G">..</A><BR>
<A NAME="JE5G"></A> I will not belabor this point much further since the rest of the book is
devoted to it. However, let's look quickly at a function that keeps being
reinvented. Almost every computer system has a program for keeping a
personal calendar, and these have frequently been expanded to "joint
scheduling calendars" that are intended to be shared by members of an
organization. Computer-based calendars are imagined to be especially
useful because they can record a full lifetime of events. They have no
space limitation imposed by little boxes or pages and can be programmed
to give automatic notifications of important events. In my highly compu-
terized environment, almost nobody-except a few diehards who spend
their whole day in front of their screens programming-uses the online
calendars. Unless you dutifully print out the day or week's entry and fold
it for your pocket, you're without your engagements when you walk
away from your computer. In any case, you can't record directly into
your engagement calendar unless you are at a terminal somewhere. When
the machine is down, as it often is, you miss appointments. Even if you
have a terminal with telecommunications at home, to find out what your
first appointment is tomorrow morning, you need to turn the machine
on, log in, enter a password, and go through a set of commands. People
soon rediscover the superior ease and convenience of a small black book.
Joint scheduling calendars are imagined to be useful because each person
in the organization has recorded his or her busy times and others can
work around them in scheduling appointments or dropping in for a visit.
The problem is that for the joint calendar to be useful to others, each
person must be honest and conscientious in filling it in. Unreliable data
can be worse than none. Many managers, and managees as well, don't
really want everybody to know exactly what they are doing all the time.
They have good reason to want to block out periods of time in a flexible
manner. They may want some people but not others to claim priority but
don't want to advertise this fact. The complexity and nuisance of making
all of these decisions ahead of time, even if it were possible, is overwhelm
ing. I know many people who are required to use these gadgets; I know
few who prefer them.

How We Got Here
<P>
What has happened is this. There has been a great shift of the role of
technology in the world. Not so long ago many of the things that people
wanted, and knew they wanted, were not to be had. They wanted
brighter lights so they could read easily at night. They wished they could
visit Aunt Beth hundreds of miles away often, or cities across the ocean
even. Whether they lived in Moline or Toulouse, they wished they could
market their wares in Paris. They wanted materials and construction
methods that would let ordinary citizens own comfortable houses. They
wanted to dig big holes fast, pave wider highways, harvest bigger grain
fields easily. They wanted to get messages to people in distant places
quickly. What stood in the way of all of these desires was that there was
no technical means to satisfy them. Technology advanced at a creep for
thousands of years. And then, seemingly, it took off. Suddenly you could
build machines that could dig a foundation hole or carry 400 people
across an ocean in an afternoon. For about a century the challenge was to
build such machines. Each new advance-each harvester, flying machine,
automobile, electric light, or telephone-was a major technological tri-
umph. People were so delighted to have some of these new devices that
they were willing to spend years in learning to operate them. After all,
the craft skills of the past on which production depended required such
practice. So it was not alarming that steam shovel operators needed a
seven-year apprenticeship, as do airline pilots still. Cars are such useful
devices that no one minds spending hundreds of hours learning to drive.
   <BR><A HREF="#2182">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="2182"></A> In the last forty years something quite astonishing has happened in the
world of technology. The underpinnings of science and engineering, and
the vast accumulation of technical know-how, experience, and compo-
nents have virtually turned the tables. Now a very large proportion of
things that people would obviously want can be built with a reasonable
amount of energy and money. It is even possible to send a few people to
the moon. With the great power and flexibility of modern technology,
with its almost unlimited talent to produce new things, more and more
of the obviously desirable things have been done. The issue used to be:
"Here is something we wish we could do, but, gosh, how can you do it?"
Now, more often, it is: "Here is something we could do; would it be

desirable?" Unfortunately, we have not gotten used to asking the second
question often enough, nor have we developed sufficiently good methods
to answer it. Instead we've gotten into the habit of saying, "Here is some-
thing I can do with my technology; I'll do it!" Thus, we have computer-
ized appointment calendars that nobody uses; unnecessarily expensive
computers, because of all of the unused features that have been pro-
grammed into them; home computers mildewing in closets because they
are too hard to use for so few things that anyone wants to do. Home
computers have tried to appeal by adding programs that let their users
copy recipes into files on the computer, then later log into the computer
to retrieve them, gooey fingers on the keyboard bringing tiny pages of
green letters into view far from the stove; by providing budget programs
with which users can enter all their budgetary items and goals and later
log in to receive help in adding the columns; by, in their most advanced
form, giving users access over their telephone lines to awkwardly pre-
sented huge and hard-to-navigate hierarchies of menus of information of
an ill-assorted and uninteresting nature; and to shopping systems that
provide poor information about items that cost more. Most of these of-
ferings seem to have been designed on the philosophy that if you could
do it with a computer it must be wonderful. But since almost all of these
functions can be performed much more conveniently and effectively with
the preexisting technology of pencils, paper, calculators, and telephones,
it should be no surprise that people find these machines more trouble
than they're worth. This diagnosis of the trouble with technology is not
confined to computers. Dertouzos, Lester, and Solow (1989) seem to
have something very similar in mind in their recommendations for curing
the malaise of all of American manufacturing when they say, "The most
critical element is the ability to predict early in the product development
cycle that a new product will yield superior customer satisfaction in the
actual marketplace." Across the board it has come as a surprise to tech-
nologists, at least to those who have realized it at all, that just doing
something novel and impressive with the technology is not enough.
   <BR><A HREF="#2231">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="2231"></A> This condemnation of design in computer technology is, of course,
much too sweeping. Often when new systems are designed for business

desires and business needs. Sometimes this is done in a satisfactory way,

A few years ago I went to a carpet store and selected two rugs and two
pads. The salesperson began to fill out the sales form, entering my name,
address, and phone number; the date and time; his name and employee
number; my charge card number; then the particulars for the first rug.
Then he pulled out a second form and entered my name, address, and
phone number, and all the rest of the same information, then the particu
lars of the second rug. Two more forms and about twenty minutes later
he was done. I asked him why he couldn't put all the items on the same
form. His reply, "We used to be able to do that, but we've just been
computerized . "
   <BR><A HREF="#2254">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="2254"></A> I hope that computerization was valuable in some way for the carpet
store, perhaps allowing it to track sales, inventory and so forth more
effectively. But it certainly reduced the productivity of the sales force and
the satisfaction of this consumer. I presume that in designing this system,
no one had watched the end users-the salesmen and customers-at
work either prior to or after delivery of the system. Believe it or not, this
is the standard operating procedure in the custom software business.
Even the astonishingly effective airline and automobile reservation sys
tems are guilty of atrocious user interfaces. They take employees a very
long time to learn, encourage enormous numbers of errors, and fail to
provide many functions that would be useful to customers. When I re
cently made an auto reservation and asked for a child seat, the clerk told
me she would try, but the computer had no place to record the child seat,
so she would have to send a separate message. It didn't work; there was
no child seat waiting.

   <A NAME="2270"></A> It is not only the initial design of computer software that is thus so
often flawed. The way in which software is produced and deployed
makes it almost inevitable that it will miss its mark in providing the right
functions for its users. After the initial specification of a product, which
may involve executives and managers of the people who will use it, some
of whom may have done the job at some time in their past, software is
usually developed by a group of programmers with no further contact
with customers until the system is complete. The programmers add and

subtract fearures and functions reflecting their own fantasies of what the
job is like and under the assumption that the users are people just like

their environment before they are sold.
   <BR><A HREF="#2285">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="2285"></A> So far I've been describing large systems specifically made for large
industrial consumers. The situation with off-the-shelf software sold in
computer stores for PC owners is much worse. Virtually anybody with a
PC can compose a new program and try to get it marketed. Scores of
programs for any particular purpose compete, and the chance that any
one of them has actually been found to be valuable, as compared with
doing things the way one used to, is vanishingly small.
   <BR><A HREF="#22Y6">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="22Y6"></A> When it comes to industry deploying computer technology in the
workplace, the situation is also grim. Take the example of introducing
word processors into a large organization. The standard technique is to
establish word processing centers where letter and manuscript typing is
sent. Savings are anticipated from reducing the number of highly trained
secretaries who need to be hired, by reducing the typing work load of
such secretaries, as well as the interruptions to their other work. Not
only are the typists in the word processing center expected to be more
efficient because of their new technology, they generally are intended to
be lower employment category people at lower pay. Concomitant with
the introduction of word processing, it is common to begin centralized
answering services-answering machines or voice mail to replace the
phone pick-up duties of secretaries. Both of these reorganizations have
the effect of reducing the number of staff in the secretarial office as well
the variety of work that is left for secretaries to do.
   <BR><A HREF="#2312">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="2312"></A> There are, unfortunately, a number of untoward side effects. The im-
portant supportive roles of the traditional secretarial staff are greatly di-
minished by this scheme. There are many fewer secretaries, so commonly
only progressively higher management are served by secretaries. As a
consequence, the rest of the staff cannot be found by customers, vendors,
and managers. The caller is informed only "that she has stepped away
from her desk." Professionals and managers have to pass their memos
and documents to typists who have no command of the local jargon or
facts. And all employees find themselves in a less personal, less knowl-
edgeable environment in which to work, with real morale and effective-
ness consequences. Meanwhile, even the boss's secretary cannot be as

useful as before, since contact with the rest of the staff diminishes. The
direct economies of these implementations of computers are apparent to
the managers who institute them, although they are often less real than
imaginary. The indirect costs of disrupting smoothly functioning office
systems that evolved over a century in American businesses are extremely
difficult to measure, but they are surely responsible for some of the disap-
pointment in bottom-line effects of new technology. The root trouble is
a lack of mechanism to discover how useful a new technology really is.
   <BR><A HREF="#2337">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="2337"></A> Often the "obvious" value of computer technology is asserted on the
grounds that where it has been deployed, there have been dramatic
changes in business organization. Usually the reorganization of typing
and telephone answering into specialized departments and the reduction
and reassignment of secretarial forces is part of the evidence. Another
part is the formation of large departments devoted to data processing,
and their role in the power structure of organizations that have them.
These are undeniably real effects, but that they are associated with major
productivity gains is far from obvious.
   <BR><A HREF="#234W">..</A><BR>
   <A NAME="234W"></A> Finally, computers are often deployed in a way that shifts who does
the labor, in the economic interest of one of the parties, but not necessar-
ily their sum. I've already given the example of the shifting of typing,
compositing, and some drafting activities from typists, editors, composi-
tors, and drafting specialists to professionals. Another widespread exam-
ple is the employment of computers to implement self-service gas
stations; the customer does the work of pumping gas, checking oil, and
wiping windshields, while a little computer chip records and transmits
the sale data to a centralized clerk who only takes money. This one might
be considered a productivity gain, in that the customer would otherwise
be wasting her time while she waits and indirectly pays for an attendant
to do these jobs. On the other hand, having these jobs done is clearly a
service of which drivers are being deprived. Whether there is a net gain
in dollars worth of total services (i.e., welfare) delivered per employee
hour is not clear. Similar remarks apply to so-called warehouse stores,
where the customer does the former "stock boy" merchandise handling
operation while the point-of-sale computer takes over the inventory con-
trol, and fast food restaurants, where the American public has been in-
duced to wait their own tables and, in astonishing contradiction of their

   Sometimes large systems have their intended effects undermined by un-
expected side effects. Some examples come from the early introduction
of operations support computer systems in the telephone companies.
When the record keeping of telephones, telephone lines, and bills became
oppressive, Bell Laboratories was expanded to produce huge software
programs to run on large mainframe computers to do all this record
keeping. It was a large and pioneering exercise in the development of
complex programs, some of them many millions of lines long. The antici-
pation was that the work force of people who need to record and retrieve
such information would be greatly reduced and the accuracy of records
greatly improved. When first introduced, however, two nasty and unex-
pected complications raised their heads. First, when people entered infor-
mation directly into the computer, they sometimes made errors. The
errors were propagated automatically from one part of the program to
another. Finding them later and expunging them was expensive and dif-
ficult. The initial solution was to hire extra clerks to check each entry
before it was made final, thus largely undoing the expected savings in
labor. The impact of this defect was eventually reduced, but to this day
accuracy in such systems remains a nettlesome problem. Data are entered
from several different sources into several different systems by several
different people: the service representative who takes the order, the engi-
neer who plans the service, and the craftsperson who installs the equip-
ment may each have to enter an address, each based on different
information. No longer does any human with rich local knowledge look
at all the related data together and make sense out of-to a human-
trivial differences in spelling, the use of an old versus new street name,
the use of St. versus Street versus Ct., and so forth. Keeping the data
clean and consistent by computer has turned out to be very difficult.

   <A NAME="2403"></A> In the second case, systems were designed to allow the information
that service representatives got from customers on the telephone to be
entered into a computer database. It turned out that the primitive screen-
based terminals that were used for the sake of economy, and in conjunc-
tion with the available capacity of the mainframe computers to which
they were connected, made it impossible for operators to enter data fast

enough to keep up with the conversation with the customer. As a remedy,
the service rep recorded the information in pencil on a form and passed
it to a entry typist who keyed it into the computer, adding to both the
transaction labor time and the opportunity for errors. While these sys-
tems became very valuable on margin, their initial design did not achieve
some of the most important labor productivity gains for which they were
intended.

   <A NAME="2D22"></A> There are many, many examples of proposed computer uses that
seemed to offer obvious productivity advantages but contained fatal
flaws that defeated their expected utility. We look closely at several in
later chapters.

The Trouble with Computers

The situation sums up this way. Computers are often used to do things
that are irrelevant or detrimental to true productivity, such as purely
share-shifting marketing functions or excess report generation. And
when computer applications are intended to increase worker or process
efficiency, they often don't help. There are chicken and egg dynamics
here. In the business climate of the last few decades, managers have been
so interested in short-term market share that they have not devoted
needed resources to making computers do better things.

But also it has
proved so much harder to make computers do serious work that they
have been diverted to easier but more frivolous employment. In either
case, we need to make computers into much better tools for work, both
for the work of individuals and for the work of organizations. When
good tools become available, their use for productivity enhancement will
be a potent competitive weapon and will supplant, or at least supple-
ment, unproductive uses. Meanwhile, there are good reasons why it is
difficult to make computers effective. Foremost is reliance on traditional
design and engineering methods that are not sufficient for the develop-
ment of tools for intellectual work. Fortunately, new engineering meth-
ods are evolving to answer the need. We will delve more deeply into
the deficiencies of current computer systems, their lack of usefulness and
usability, and then explore the new techniques of user-centered design,
development, and deployment.
