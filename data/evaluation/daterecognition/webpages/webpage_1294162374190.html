				A popular bar had a new robotic bartender installed.<br />
<br />
A fellow came in for a drink and the robot asked him, &#39;What&#39;s your <br />
IQ?&#39;<br />
The man replied, &#39;150.&#39; So the robot proceeded to make conversation about Quantum physics, string theory, atomic chemistry, and so on.<br />
<br />
 The man listened intently and thought, &#39;This is really cool.&#39;<br />
<br />
 The man decided to test the robot. He walked out of the bar, turned<br />
 around, and came back in for another drink. Again, the robot asked him, <br />
&#39;What&#39;s your IQ?&#39; The man responded, &#39;100.&#39; So the robot started talking about football, baseball, and so on.<br />
<br />
 The man thought to himself, &#39;Wow, this is amazing.&#39;<br />
<br />
 The man went out and came back in a third time. As before, the robot<br />
 asked him, &#39;What&#39;s your IQ?&#39; The man replied, &#39;50.&#39;<br />
<br />
 The robot then said, &#39;So, you gonna vote for Bush again?&#39;<br />

Cracks Found On Military Helicopter Blades<br />
<br />
This image is of cracks found during routine inspections of the Kaman Aerospace SH-2 Seasprite helicopter. Pilots and crew of these helicopters were seriously alarmed (and Rightly so) when this information was released. They were especially concerned because the cracks weren&#39;t found in just one location - they were all over the craft.<br />

				A father and son went hunting together for the first time. <br />
<br />
The father said: &quot;Stay here and be very QUIET. I&#39;ll be across<br />
the field.&quot; <br />
<br />
A few minutes later the father heard a blood curdling scream<br />
and ran back to his son. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; the father asked. &quot;I told you to be quiet.&quot; <br />
<br />
The boy answered, &quot;Look, I was quiet when the<br />
Snake slithered across my feet. <br />
<br />
I was quiet when the bear breathed down my neck. <br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t move a muscle when the skunk climbed over my shoulder.<br />
<br />
I closed my eyes and held my breath when the wasp stung me. <br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t cough when I swallowed the gnat. <br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t cuss or scratch when the poison oak started itching. <br />
<br />
But when the two chipmunks crawled up my pant legs and said, <br />
â€˜Should we eat them here or take them with us?&#39; Well, I guess I<br />
just panicked.&quot;.

				Jeff walks into a bar and sees his friend Pete slumped over the bar. He<br />
walks over and asks Pete what&#39;s wrong. &quot;Well,&quot; replies Pete, &quot;You know that beautiful girl at work that I wanted to ask out, but I got an erection every time I saw her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; replies Jeff with a laugh. &quot;Well,&quot; says Pete, straightening up, &quot;I finally worked up the courage to ask her out, and she agreed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great&#33;&quot; says Jeff, &quot;When are you going out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I went to meet her this evening,&quot; continues Pete, &quot;but I was worried I&#39;d get an erection again. So I got some duct tape and taped &quot;it&quot; to my leg, so if I did, it wouldn&#39;t show&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sensible&quot; says Jeff. <br />
<br />
&quot;So I get to her door,&quot; says Pete, &quot;and I rang her doorbell. She answered it in the sheerest, sexiest, dress you ever saw.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what happened then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I kicked her in the face.&quot;

				Some Metaphysical Jokes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Buddhist Dinner</strong><br />
<br />
Q. What did the Buddhist say at the hot dog stand?<br />
A. &quot;Make me one with everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>CafÃ© Descartes</strong><br />
<br />
Descartes walks into a restaurant and sits down. <br />
A waiter asks, &quot;Would you like some wine with your dinner?&quot; <br />
Descartes replies, &quot;I think not,&quot; and vanishes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Bad News for Moses</strong><br />
<br />
Suddenly a booming, sonorous voice speaks from above: &quot;You, Moses, heed me. I have good news, and bad news.&quot;<br />
Moses is staggered. The voice continues:<br />
&quot;You, Moses, will lead the people of Israel from bondage. If the Pharoah refuses to release your bonds I will smite Egypt with a rain of frogs.<br />
&quot;You, Moses will lead the people of Israel to the Promised Land. If the Pharoah blocks your way I will smite Egypt with a plague of locusts.<br />
&quot;You, Moses, will lead the people to freedom and safety. If the Pharoah&#39;s army pursues you, I will part the waters of the Red Sea to open your path to the Promised Land.&quot;<br />
Moses is stunned. &quot;That&#39;s, that&#39;s fantastic, I can&#39;t believe it&#33;&quot; he stammers, &quot;but what&#39;s the bad news?&quot;<br />
&quot;You, Moses, must write the environmental impact statement.&quot;

				The guy decided to buy himself a convertible sports car.  On his way home, he decided to see just how the car handled, so he punched the accelerator.  As the car shot around a corner, he passed a police officer, who immediately flipped around, turned on his lights and gave chase.  The guy figured he could lose the cop, and continued to accelerate.  As they flew around several more corners, the guy started wondering what the hell he was doing, and figured he had better come up with a good lie to save his ass.  He pulled over and waited for the cop to come up.<br />
<br />
The cop slowly waltzed up to the car and asked the drivers license and registration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer, I&#39;m sorry for not pulling over right away.&quot; the guy said, &quot;I don&#39;t know what came over me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The officer replied, &quot;Give me a good reason I shouldn&#39;t give you a ticket, and I will let you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy thought for a moment, and finally said, &quot;My wife ran off with a police officer last week&#33;  When I saw your lights in my review mirror, I thought you were trying to bring her back&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good day, sir&quot; the police officer said as we walked back to his car.<br />

				An 85-year-old went to his doctor&#39;s office to get a sperm count (I don&#39;t know why this would be important to an 85-year-old but....). The doctor gave the man a jar and said,&quot;Take this jar home and bring back a semen sample tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day, the 85-year-old man reappeared at the doctor&#39;s office and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous  day.<br />
<br />
The doctor asked what happened and the man explained: &quot;Well, doc, it&#39;s like this -<br />
<br />
First I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, and still nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We even called up Arleen, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit and she even tried squeezin&#39; it between her knees, but still nothing.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The doctor was shocked&#33;  &quot;You asked your neighbor?&quot;  <br />
<br />
The old man replied,  &quot;Yep, And no matter what we tried, we still couldn&#39;t get the jar open.&quot;

Jackson&#39;s two-disc set went straight to number two in the UK - but he failed to match that success in his home country.<br />
<br />
The number one US album, multi-artist compilation CD Now 19, sold 436,000 copies in its first week.<br />
<br />
Jackson faces a struggle to repair his image and repay debts that prosecutors in his trial claimed amounted to &#036;300m (Â£170m). <br />
<br />
British public relations supremo Max Clifford has revealed he turned down a request to represent the singer after his trial.<br />
<br />
&quot;He came to me a month ago and I turned him down,&quot; Mr Clifford said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be the hardest job in PR after Saddam Hussein and I would be astounded if he could turn things around.<br />
<br />
&quot;People were extremely offended by even some of the things he admitted in court.<br />
<br />
Record sales<br />
<br />
&quot;The final judgement is with the record buying public and they have made their verdict clear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson has sold more than 135 million albums during his career, including 60 million copies of Thriller.<br />
<br />
His last original album, Invincible, sold two million copies when it came out in 2001.<br />
<br />
The Essential Michael Jackson is the latest in a string of greatest hits packages that has also included HIStory, Number Ones and The Ultimate Collection.</div></div>

Not sure if this is true, but damned funny.<br />
<br />
<p class='citation'>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class='quote'>At Duke University, there were four sophomores taking<br />
chemistry and all of them had an &quot;A&quot; so far. These four friends were<br />
so confident&nbsp; that the weekend before finals, they decided to visit<br />
some friends and have a big party.<br />
<br />
They had a great time, but after all the hearty partying,&nbsp;  they slept<br />
all day Sunday and didn&#39;t make it back to Duke until early<br />
Monday morning.<br />
<br />
Rather than taking the final then, they decided that after the final<br />
they would explain to their professor why they missed it.<br />
<br />
They said that they visited friends but on the way back they had a<br />
flat tire. As a result, they missed the final. The professor agreed<br />
they could make up the final the next day.<br />
<br />
The guys were excited and relieved. They studied that night for the<br />
exam. The Professor placed them in separate rooms and gave them a test<br />
booklet. They quickly answered the first problem worth 5<br />
points.<br />
<br />
Cool, they thought&#33;&nbsp; Each one in separate rooms, thinking this was<br />
going to be easy...... then they turned the page. On the second page<br />
was written....<br />
<br />
For 95 points: Which tire?</div></div>

				Another funny email.  Isabel, you got any clients like this?  Are you &quot;Belinda&quot; at the gym?  LOL  I&#39;ll bet you love it.<br />

Cary<br />
<br />
<br />
A WEEK AT THE GYM; ONE MAN&#39;S STORY - If you read this without laughing out loud, there is something wrong with you. This is dedicated to everyone who ever attempted to get into a regular workout routine.<br />
<br />
Dear Diary...<br />
For my fortieth birthday  this year, my wife (the dear) purchased a week of personal  training at the local health club for me. Although I am still in great shape since playing on my college football team 25 years  ago, I decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a  try.<br />
<br />
Called the club and made my reservations with personal trainer named Belinda, who identified herself as a 26-year old aerobics instructor and model for athletic clothing  and swimwear. My wife seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get  started&#33; The club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress.............<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Monday:</strong><br />
Started my day at  6:00am. Tough to get out of bed, but and it was well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Belinda waiting for me. She is something of a Greek goddess - with blond hair, dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile. Woo Hoo&#33;<br />
<br />
Belinda gave  me a tour and showed me the machines. She took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill. She was alarmed that my pulse was so fast, but I attributed it to standing next to her in her Lycra aerobic outfit. I enjoyed watching the skillful way in which she conducted her aerobics class after my workout today.<br />
<br />
Very inspiring. Belinda was encouraging as I did my sit-ups, although my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time she was around.  This is going to be a FANTASTIC week&#33;&#33;<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Tuesday:</strong><br />
I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out the door. Belinda made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air-then she put weights on  it&#33; My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I made the full mile. Belinda&#39;s rewarding smile made it all worthwhile. I feel GREAT&#33;&#33; It&#39;s a whole new life for me.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Wednesday:</strong><br />
The only way I can brush my teeth is by laying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I believe I have a hernia in both pectorals. Driving was OK as long as I didn&#39;t try to steer or stop. I parked on top of a GEO in the club parking lot. Belinda was impatient with me, insisting that my screams bothered other club members.  Her voice is a little too perky for  early in the morning and when she scolds, she gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying.<br />
<br />
My chest hurt  when I got on the treadmill, so Belinda put me on the stair monster. Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators? Belinda told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life. She said some other #### too.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Thursday:</strong><br />
Belinda was waiting for me with her vampire-like teeth exposed as her thin, cruel lips were  pulled back in full snarl. I couldn&#39;t help being a half an hour late, it took me that long to tie my shoes.  Belinda took me to work out with dumbbells. When she was not looking, I ran  and hid in the men&#39;s room. She sent Lars to find me, then, as punishment, put me on the rowing machine - which I  sank.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Friday:</strong><br />
I hate that bitch Belinda more that any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history  of the world. Stupid, skinny, anemic little cheerleader. If there was a part of my body I could move without unbearable pain, I would beat her with it. Belinda wanted me to work on my triceps. I don&#39;t have any triceps&#33; And if you don&#39;t want dents in the floor, don&#39;t hand me the *&amp;%#(#&amp;**&#33;&#33;@*@ barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich. (Which I am sure you learned in the sadist school you attended and graduated magna cum laude from.)<br />
<br />
The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and nutrition teacher.  Why couldn&#39;t it have been someone softer, like the drama coach or the choir director?<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Saturday:</strong><br />
Belinda left a message on my answering machine in her grating, shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today. Just hearing her made me want to smash the machine with my planner. However, I lacked the strength to even use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the Weather Channel.<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Sunday:</strong><br />
I&#39;m having the Church  van pick me up for services today so I can go and thank GOD that this week is over. I will also pray that next year my wife (the bitch) will choose a gift for me that is fun - like  root canal or a vasectomy.

<br />
 Updated: 2005-08-08 09:26<br />
<br />
Men who are accused of never listening by women now have an excuse -- women&#39;s voices are more difficult for men to listen to than other men&#39;s, a report said. <br />
<br />
The Daily Mail, quoting findings published in the specialist magazine.<br />
<br />
NeuroImage, said researchers at Sheffield university in northern England discovered startling differences in the way the brain responds to male and female sounds.<br />
<br />
Men deciphered female voices using the auditory part of the brain that processes music, while male voices engaged a simpler mechanism, it said.<br />
<br />
The Mail quoted researcher Michael Hunter as saying, &quot;The female voice is actually more complex than the male voice, due to differences in the size and shape of the vocal cords and larynx between men and women, and also due to women having greater natural &#39;melody&#39; in their voices.<br />
<br />
&quot;This causes a more complex range of sound frequencies than in a male voice.&quot;<br />
<br />
The findings may help explain why people suffering hallucinations usually hear male voices, the report added, as the brain may find it much harder to conjure up a false female voice accurately than a false male voice.</div></div>

				Seeing as how my car and office temp guages registerd 102 today at about 4:57, I thought I&#39;d post this.  Yes, I lived in Houston for about four and a half years.  It&#39;s damned hot there, Africa hot in August and September, and no, you never really get used to it.   Very similar to the emails about moving to the frozen tundra called Yankee land.  Looking for even hotter temps as we move into late summer.  God forbid the A/C go out.  It was 90 degrees at 8 a.m. this morning.  Late summer heat wave is here.  Can&#39;t wait for October.  LOL  No, I&#39;m not used to the heat and I&#39;ve lived on the Gulf Coast all my life.  Pray for the new Yankee arrivals that arrived this summer.<br />

I love it here.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

 Really heating up. Got to 100 today. Not a problem. Live in an&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 air-conditioned home, drive an air-conditioned car. What a pleasure to&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 see the sun everyday like this. I&#39;m turning into a sun worshiper.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />

 Had the backyard landscaped with western plants today. Lots of cactus&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />
 and rocks. What a breeze to maintain. No more mowing lawn for me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />
 Another scorcher today, but I love it here.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

 The temperature hasn&#39;t been below 100 all week. How do people get used&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 to this kind of heat? At least it&#39;s kind of windy though. But getting&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />
 used to the heat and humidity is taking longer than I expected.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

 Fell asleep by the pool. (Got 3rd degree burns over 60% of my body).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 Missed 3 days of work. What a dumb thing to do. I learned my lesson&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />
 though. Got to respect the ol&#39; sun in a climate like this.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />

 I missed Morgan (our cat) sneaking into the car when I left this&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 morning. By the time I got to the hot car for lunch, Morgan had died and&nbsp; <br />
 swollen up to the size of a shopping bag and stank up the &#036;2,000 leather&nbsp; <br />
 upholstery. I told the kids that she ran away. The car now smells like&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 Kibbles and shits. I learned my lesson though. No more pets in this&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />
 heat.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />

 The wind sucks. It feels like a giant freaking blow dryer&#33;&#33; And it&#39;s hot&nbsp; <br />
 as hell. The home air-conditioner is not working and the AC repairman&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />
 charged &#036;200 just to drive by and tell me he needed to order parts.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

 Been sleeping outside by the pool for 3 nights now. &#036;1,500 in damn house&nbsp; <br />
 payments and we can&#39;t even go inside. Why did I ever come here?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />

 It&#39;s 115 degrees. Finally got the air-conditioner fixed today. It cost&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 &#036;500 and gets the temperature down to 85, but this freaking humidity&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 makes the house feel like it&#39;s about 95.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />
Stupid repairman. I hate this stupid city.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />

If another wise ass asks, &quot;Hot enough for you today?&quot; I&#39;m going to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

 Tried to run some errands after work. Wore shorts, and sat on the black&nbsp;  <br />
 leather seats in the ol&#39; car. I thought my ass was on fire. I lost 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
 layers of flesh and all the hair on the back of my legs and ass. Now my&nbsp;  <br />
 car smells like burnt hair, fried ass, and baked cat.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />

I lived in the panhandle of Texas for 9 months, 1977.  The day we crossed the Oklahoma/Texas border, moving to another base, I told my father.... I would never set foot in Texas again.  I&#39;ve been true to my word.  <br />
<br />
Tornados, heat, being the minority in school (and I&#39;m caucasion), Engish as a second language.  No offense to our Texas members, but you couldn&#39;t pay me visit there.

				A True Story.....<br />
<br />
On July 20 1969, a certain Mr Armstrong was about to climb down the ladder to set foot on the Moon for the first time.<br />
Prior to giving his famous &#39;Giant Leap For Mankind&#39; line, he was heard to utter &#39;Good Luck Mr.Gorsky&#39;.<br />
<br />
This caused some confusion back at NASA, as no-one knew what he was talking about. Hurried searches were carried out to try to identify this Mr Gorsky. Was he a Russian cosmonaut? Was he a spy? Nobody knew.<br />
<br />
After Armstrong returned to Earth, he was questioned many times over the incident, but remained tight-lipped.<br />
<br />
Many years later, at a public engagement, he was asked again, and he said that a suitable time had elapsed, and that  the parties concerned were most certainly dead. He then went on to explain how, as a teenager, he was in his backyard with a friend, shooting the basket. <br />
His neighbours, the Gorskys, were having one of their many rows, and he could clearly hear the argument coming from the neighbours bedroom wind&#111;w....(Mrs G.) &#39;SEX?...YOU WANT SEX? You&#39;ll get sex when the boy next door walks on the Moon&#33;&#39; <br />

<p class='citation'>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class='quote'><strong class='bbc'>F***ing signs now theft-proof</strong><br />
<br />
The Austrian town of F***ing has erected theft-proof road signs embedded in concrete blocks.<br />
<br />
Officials acted because they were fed up with English-speaking tourists stealing them as souvenirs.<br />
<br />
After the last &#39;Welcome to F***ing&#39; sign was stolen, Mayor Siegfried Hauppl ordered brand new theft-proof road signs.<br />
<br />
They are bolted and welded to steel posts embedded in concrete in the ground and the mayor added: &quot;It would take all night to steal one.&quot;<br />
<br />
F***ing always attracts a lot of attention in the summer months, with tourists driving up from nearby Salzburg to pose for pictures in front of the F***ing signs.<br />
<br />
But Mayor Hauppl said that while the money tourists spent in the area was welcome, locals were fed up with having to replace the signs.</div></div><br />

				Three Texas plastic surgeons were playing golf together and discussing  surgeries they had performed.  One of them said, &quot;I&#39;m the best plastic  surgeon in Texas.  A concert pianist lost 7 fingers in an accident, I  reattached them, and 8 months later he performed a private concert for the  Queen of England.&quot; <br />
<br />
One of the others said. &quot;That&#39;s nothing.  A  young man lost both arms and legs in an accident, I reattached them, and 2  years later he won a gold medal in 5 field events in the Olympics.&quot;   <br />
<br />
The third surgeon said, &quot;You guys are amateurs.   Several  years ago a cowboy who was high on cocaine and alcohol rode a horse head-on  into a train traveling 80 miles an hour.   All I had left to work  with was the horse&#39;s ass and a cowboy hat.   Now he&#39;s president of  United States.

				If you have a few minutes and would like a good laugh, go to the site on ebay where some guy auctioned a pair of black leather pants.  Too damned funny.  The guy has a wit that&#39;s just hilarious.  The funniest stuff was in the questions and answers he received during the bidding process.  I&#39;ll post what I can, but I highly recommend going to the site so you can see the leather pants in question.  Hilarious stuff.  The questions are in reverse order, but they&#39;re funny either way you read them.  My favorite response was &quot;Hello Senator Clinton.&quot;  LMAO<br />

<a href='http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=8335653541#description' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>http://cgi.ebay.com/...541#description</a><br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>DKNY Men&#39;s Leather Pants I Unfortunately Own<br />
Stylish. Expensive. Very much a bad purchase for me.</strong><br />
<br />
You are bidding on a mistake.<br />
<br />
We all make mistakes. We date the wrong people for too long. We chew gum with our mouths open. We say inappropriate things in front of grandma.<br />
<br />
And we buy leather pants.<br />
<br />
I can explain these pants and why they are in my possession. I bought them many, many years ago under the spell of a woman whom I believed to have taste. She suggested I try them on. I did. She said they looked good. I wanted to have a relationship of sorts with her. Iâ€™m stupid and prone to impulsive decisions. I bought the pants.<br />
<br />
The relationship, probably for better, never materialized. The girl, whose name I canâ€™t even recall, is a distant memory. I think she was short.<br />
<br />
Ultimately the pants were placed in the closet where they have remained, unworn, for nearly a decade. I would like to emphasize that: Aside from trying these pants on, they have never, ever been worn. In public or private.<br />
<br />
I have not worn these leather pants for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
I am not a member of Queen.<br />
I do not like motorcycles.<br />
I am not Rod Stewart.<br />
I am not French.<br />
I do not cruise for transvestites in an expensive sports car.<br />
<br />
These were not cheap leather pants. They are Donna Karan leather pants. Theyâ€™re for men. Brave men, I would think. Perhaps tattooed, pierced men. In fact, Iâ€™ll go so far as to say you either have to be very tough, very gay, or very famous to wear these pants and get away with it.<br />
<br />
Again, theyâ€™re menâ€™s pants, but theyâ€™d probably look great on the right lady. Ladies can get away with leather pants much more often than men can. Itâ€™s a sad fact that men who own leather pants will have to come to terms with.<br />
<br />
They are size 34x34. I am no longer size 34x34, so even were I to suddenly decide I was a famous gay biker I would not be able to wear these pants. These pants are destined for someone else. For reasons unknown - perhaps to keep my options open, in case I wanted to become a pirate - I have shuffled these unworn pants from house to house, closet to closet. Alas, it is now time to part ways so that I may use the extra room for any rhinestone-studded jeans I may purchase in the future.<br />
<br />
These pants are in excellent condition. They were never taken on pirate expeditions. They werenâ€™t worn onstage. They didnâ€™t straddle a Harley, or a guy named Harley. They just hung there, sad and ignored, for a few presidencies.<br />
<br />
Someone, somewhere, will look great in these pants. Iâ€™m hoping that someone is you, or that you can be suckered into buying them by a girl youâ€™re trying to bed.<br />
<br />
Please buy these leather pants.<br />

<strong class='bbc'>Questions from other members : DKNY Men&#39;s Leather Pants I Unfortunately Own</strong><br />
<br />
Q: 	I&#39;m confused, is Donna Karan a rock star or a transvestite?<br />
	Sep-23-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	It&#39;s a very fine line, really.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	I have a friend that emails these types of auctions to me for a good laugh and I must admit, yours is the best I have seen in a long time. Your wording and demeanor are perfect. If I had the cake to spend on something I would never wear right now, I would buy them just for the simple fact you made me laugh that hard. I wish you made commercials on TV so I wouldn&#39;t be forced to channel surf when they came on. Kudos to you. Are all your descriptions this funny or is this a fluke? Your replies are excellent and this auction should be on Letterman or something. Good luck and thanks for the laugh.<br />
	Sep-23-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	I used to write commercials, but they&#39;re hard to make funny because the people who make the final decisions are idiots. But maybe you&#39;ll like Banterist.com or Sixtysecond.com<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	LOL. I once knew a guy who actually wore leather pants, loved them, and was very popular with them. That was 15 years ago...he was Italian...and my uncle&#39;s boyfriend. Enough said.<br />
	Sep-23-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Italy shares France&#39;s reputation for adultery, leather pants, and aggressiveness to women. Except for your uncle&#39;s boyfriend, of course.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	Love the pants but . . . I wonder, how many thongs do you think could be made from them? Fruitcreek.<br />
	Sep-23-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	For Americans? 15. French? 45.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	Are these pants worthy of cruising for transvestites while in my Maserati? I just got one and need an outfit that would go with my new car.<br />
	Sep-22-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	I think leather pants would accent that mid-life crisis quite nicely.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	I just wanted to tell you that you made me laugh aloud&#33; First, when my husband was in high school he apparently bought a white satin Michael Jacksonesque multi-zippered jacket from The Chess King under strikingly similar circumstances. I wonder if it is the same chick . . . Second, my husband and I recently hosted a white trash party, Trailerpalooza. We had been to a 38 Special concert and decided to knock off thier look. So we each bought pleather pants (though these beauties would have been perfect&#33;) and I then sewed flame fabric to the bottoms, as if it was lapping up the legs. We also got leather jackets which we adorned with a bit of flame fabric. Well, somehow, I came out looking like a badass, but my poor husband looked like a homo. In fact someone actually said, -It&#39;s amazing how pleather makes Shari look so bad, and Rick so gay.- I wish I had a picture on my computer, because I think it would make you laugh&#33; Anyway, good luck with the sale of your magic pants&#33;<br />
	Sep-22-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	When I was a busboy at El Torito I remember a waiter who saved up hundreds for a replica Michael Jackson &#39;Beat It&#39; jacket. Zippers everywhere. At the time I thought he was a god. Now I think he&#39;s probably buried in someone&#39;s tomato garden.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	Thank you for the inspiration. I am now thinking of ebaying every little thing....and I do mean little thing that I ever wore to be a man pleaser/enticer. That would have to include stiletto heels, leather bustiers, gstrings and the like.....hmmm, wait a minute....now that I think about it....I might have to bid on those pants and create an ensemble....for myself. Did I mention that I am 5&#39;2?<br />
	Sep-22-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Hello Senator Clinton.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	FUNNY&#33;&#33; I too have a pair of leather pants to sell and for very similar reasons. Mine also have severe case of closet shrinkage. Thanks for the laugh and happy selling. tom<br />
	Sep-22-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Hmm. Maybe we know the same girl.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	I would like to be tough, gay or a rock star. Do you think purchasing and subsequently donning these trousers will help?<br />
	Sep-22-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Probably not if you call them &#39;trousers.&#39; A true rockstar would say &#39;pants&#39; or &#39;duds&#39; or something more rock-star-y, like &#39;ladykillers.&#39;<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	If they did still fit.. and I wasn&#39;t married, would you wear them for me? LOL.. best of luck&#33;<br />
	Sep-21-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Yes, but only if I was wearing a pink tank top and re-enacting Billy Squier&#39;s regrettable &#39;Rock me tonight&#39; video.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	No question, just wanted to tell you this is the best listing i&#39;ve ever read. I&#39;m sorry it didn&#39;t work out with the short girl, but am so proud of you for never wearing these. <img src='http://www.conspiracycafe.net/forum/public/style_emoticons/default/smile.gif' class='bbc_emoticon' alt=':)' /> Good luck with your sale&#33;<br />
	Sep-21-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Thank you. I&#39;ll be free of them in less than two days, and at least &#036;76 closer to owning a yacht.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	I don&#39;t actually need the pants... and they wouldn&#39;t fit my less than womanly curves even if I could pull them off- but I could not resist telling you what a fabulous ad this is. While reason prevailed in the end, I was almost convinced to buy the pants if for no other reason than to see if I could be coy enough to get a man to wear them in hopes of a relationship with me... fabulous ad, just fabulous.<br />
	Sep-21-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Sadly I lack the ability to sell people things they don&#39;t need - unlike Ron Popeil and The Sharper Image.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	You express yourself exactly like my ex-fiancee. I had to check if you lived in Boulder, CO just to see if you were him. I really didn&#39;t think anyone else had his matter of fact mixed with twisted humor personality. Ten years ago I was just ending our relationship so I was going thinking that possibly he bought these pants to try and woo a little waitress vixen with an IQ half that of her bust size. By the way, the last person that claimed that you were stereotyping, did you for some reason envision Dueling Banjos playing in the background with a man sporting a greased back mullet and a makeshift spittoon, and, of course, comfy leather pants, or was that just me?<br />
	Sep-21-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Yes, the grammar and tone said &#39;Deliverance&#39; but the leather pants in church said &#39;Wham UK&#39;. So I&#39;m confused.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	you enjoy stereotyping people that wear leather dont ya, you think owning leather is gay, let me tell you something i am not gay, i am not famous, dont ride a bike, and unlike i aint a coward. i do own 2 pairs of them, to me they are more comfy than blue jeans ever will be, i where them anywhere i want including church, no ones ever said nothing about them<br />
	Sep-20-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	More important: Do you need a pair of 34x34 leather pants?<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	I am in a band, but do not wear leather pants. However, if I DID wear leather pants, your pants are the ones I would buy because your description is...eloquent and touching in a leatherish sort of way. May we post your ad on our site?<br />
	Sep-20-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	I think I answered this already, but eBay is asking it again for some reason. Thank you for being polite and seeking permission. Sure, you can post it. After all, I&#39;m trying to sell pants.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	Bsack, I&#39;m an editor for Poor Mojo&#39;s Almanac(k) (http:// www.poormojo.org), a weekly online magazine now entering its sixth year of publication. We&#39;d like to run the text of your posting, with the image of the glorious pants, as a rant on our site. May we do so? Our submission guidlines can be found here: <a href='http://www.poormojo.org/submission.html' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>http://www.poormojo....submission.html</a> (Long story short: we owe you a beer for one piece--provided you came to Ann Arbor or SF, CA to pick it up--or will reward you with a PMjA t-shirt after we&#39;ve published 5 of your pieces.) Interested? Best, Dave . . . Editor and Technologist PMjA<br />
	Sep-20-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Sure, if you don&#39;t mind that it&#39;s already on Banterist.com<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	Well, it looks like you&#39;re going to sell them. They&#39;re too big for me anyway and I&#39;m female. You&#39;re a great writer -- so natural, so funny. I think you should be in standup. Thank you so much for making my day.<br />
	Sep-19-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Thank you for the kind words. In lieu of standup I post things on Banterist.com. The hours are better and there&#39;s no drink minimum.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	For Mr. VBMX: If he were gay, he would know what boot cut means. What does VBMX mean?<br />
	Sep-19-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	I&#39;m not sure. It sounds like a missile.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	Hi, Sorry I don&#39;t want the leather pants but just had to write and say I really had a good laugh at your description&#33;&#33; I really hope you sell them .... and not to a guy&#33; Good luck&#33; Jeannette<br />
	Sep-18-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	If you change your mind and want the pants, I&#39;ll be waiting patiently by the keyboard.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	Q: 	Seen your ad on VBMX.com.....are you gay? LOL Just kidding&#33;&#33; I would claim these on VBMX&#33;&#33; Now all the guys are gonna think of you as a sissy&#33;&#33; LOL&#33;&#33;&#33; Good luck bro&#33;&#33;<br />
	Sep-18-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	Thanks. That&#39;s a lot of exclamation points.<br />
<br />
Q: 	Are these boot cut pants and if not what is the width measurement of the bottom of the pant leg?<br />
	Sep-17-05<br />
	<br />
	A: 	I do not know what a boot cut is, but the pants are 8.25 inches wide at the bottom.

				<strong class='bbc'>US Intelligence?? </strong><br />
<br />
Osama Bin Laden decided to send George Bush a letter, to let him know he was still in the game.<br />
 <br />
Bush opened the letter, but it contained only a single line of coded message...<br />
 <br />
 <strong class='bbc'>i370HSSV-0773H</strong><br />
 <br />
Bush was baffled, so he emailed it to Condi Rice. Condi and her aides had no clue either, so they sent it to the FBI.<br />
 <br />
No one could solve it at the FBI so it went to the CIA, then to the NSA.<br />
 <br />
With no clue as to its meaning they eventually asked Britain&#39;s MI-6 for help. <br />
 <br />
Within a minute, MI-6 cabled the White House with this reply... &quot;Tell the President he&#39;s holding the message upside down&#33;&quot;

				A woman was shopping at her local supermarket where she selected:<br />
a half-gallon of 2% milk,<br />
a carton of eggs,<br />
a quart of orange juice,<br />
a head of romaine lettuce,<br />
a 2 lb. can of coffee and<br />
a 1 lb. package of bacon.<br />
<br />
As she was unloading her items on the conveyor belt to check out, a<br />
drunk standing behind her watched as she placed the items in front of the<br />
cashier.<br />
<br />
While the cashier was ringing up her purchases, the drunk calmly<br />
stated, &quot;You must be single.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman was a bit startled by this proclamation, but she was<br />
intrigued by the derelict&#39;s intuition, since she was indeed single. She looked at<br />
her six items on the belt and saw nothing particularly unusual about her<br />
selections that could have tipped off the drunk to her marital status.<br />
<br />
Curiosity getting the better of her, she said &quot;Well, you know what,<br />
you&#39;re absolutely correct. But how on earth did you know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The drunk replied, &quot; &#39;Cause you&#39;re f*cking ugly.&quot; <br />

				If Men Were Agony Aunts<br />
<br />
Q: MY HUSBAND WANTS A THREESOME WITH MY BEST FRIEND AND ME<br />
<br />
A: Obviously you husband cannot get enough of you&#33; Knowing there is only one of you, he can only settle for the next best thing, you best friend. Far from being an issue, this can only bring you closer together. Why not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you are still apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you. If you&#39;re still not sure then just perform oral sex on him and cook him a nice meal while you think about it.<br />
<br />
Q: MY HUSBAND CONTINUALLY ASKS ME TO PERFORM ORAL SEX ON HIM.<br />
<br />
A: Do it. Semen can help you lose weight and gives a great glow to your skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to do is to thank him by performing it twice a day; then cook him a nice meal.<br />
<br />
Q: MY HUSBAND HAS TOO MANY NIGHTS OUT WITH THE BOYS.<br />
<br />
A: This is perfectly natural behaviour and should be encouraged. The man is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your relationship better than the man being away for a day or two. (It&#39;s a great time to clean the house too&#33;) Just look at how emotional and happy he is when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he returns is for you and your best friend to perform oral sex on him. Then cook him a nice meal.<br />
<br />
Q: MY HUSBAND DOESN&#39;T KNOW WHERE MY CLITORIS IS.<br />
<br />
A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and cook him a delicious meal.<br />
<br />
Q: MY HUSBAND IN UNINTERESTED IN FOREPLAY.<br />
<br />
A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for foreplay. What this means is you do not love your husband as much as you should; he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so selfish&#33; Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and cooking him a nice meal.<br />
<br />
Q: MY HUSBAND ALWAYS HAS AN ORGASM THEN ROLLS OVER AND GOES TO SLEEP WITHOUT GIVING ME ONE.<br />
<br />
A: I&#39;m not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you&#39;ve forgotten to cook him a nice meal.<br />

				A snake and a bunny rabbit meet up. Both animals have been blind since birth. The snake says, &#39;If we feel each other all over, perhaps we can work out what sort of creatures we are.&#39; The bunny rabbit agrees and the snake goes to work. <br />
<br />
The snake says, &#39;well, you&#39;re covered in soft fur, you have long ears, whiskers, a cute nose and a cotton tail......I&#39;m guessing your a bunny rabbit.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Great&#39; says the bunny rabbit, &#39;my turn now&#39; and sets to work with its paws. After he is finished, he says &#39;well, you&#39;re slippery all over, you&#39;re spineless, and have no balls......I think you&#39;re a supervisor, a charge hand or a manager....&#39;

				A couple has a dog who snores. Annoyed because she can&#39;t sleep, the wife goes to the vet to see if he can help. The vet tells the woman to tie a ribbon around the dog&#39;s testicles and he will stop snoring. &quot;Yeah, right&#33;&quot; she says. A few minutes after going to bed, the dog begins snoring,  as  usual. The wife tosses and turns, unable to sleep.  Muttering to herself, she goes to the closet and grabs a piece of red ribbon and ties it carefully around the dog&#39;s testicles. Sure enough, the dog stops snoring&#33; The woman is amazed&#33;  Later that night, her husband returns home drunk from being out drinking with his buddies. He climbs into bed, falls asleep and begins snoring  loudly. The woman thinks maybe the ribbon might work on him. So she goes to the closet again, grabs a piece of blue ribbon and ties it around her husband&#39;s testicles. Amazingly, it also works on him&#33; The woman sleeps soundly.<br />
The husband wakes from his drunken stupor and stumbles into the bathroom. As he stands in front of the toilet, he glances in the mirror and sees a blue ribbon attached to his privates.  He is very confused and as he walks back into the bedroom, he sees the red ribbon attached to his dog&#39;s testicles. He shakes his head and looks at the dog and whispers, &quot;I don&#39;t know where we were, or, what we did, but, by God, we took first and second place.&quot;

				A young Aussie bloke moved to London and went to Harrods Department store looking for a job. <br />
<br />
The manager asked &quot;Do you have any sales experience?&quot; <br />
<br />
The young man answered &quot;Yeah, I was a salesman back home.&quot; <br />
<br />
The manager liked the Aussie so he gave him the job. His first day on the job was challenging and busy, but he got through it. <br />
<br />
After the store was locked up, the manager came down and asked &quot;OK, so how many sales did you make today?&quot; <br />
<br />
The Aussie said &quot;One.&quot; <br />
<br />
The manager groaned and continued &quot;Just one? Our sales people average 20 or 30 sales a day. How much was the sale for?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Â£101,237.64.&quot; <br />
<br />
The manager choked and exclaimed &quot;Â£101,237.64? What the hell did you sell him?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first I sold him a small fish hook, then a medium fish hook, and then I sold him a new fishing rod. Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down at the coast, so I told him he would need a boat. <br />
<br />
So we went down to the boat department and I sold him that twin-engine Power Cat. Then he said he didn&#39;t think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to car sales and I sold him the 4 x 4 Suzuki&quot;. <br />
<br />
The manager, incredulous, said &quot;You mean to tell me....a guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and 4x4?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No no no...he came in here to buy a box of tampons for his girlfriend and I said...&#39;Well, since your weekend&#39;s fu@#ed, you might as well go fishing.&quot;

				I found this in an old file, still cracks me up. <br />
<br />
If you can&#39;t laugh about this you need help.... This is a supposedly a true story from the Word Perfect help line. Needless to say the help desk employee was fired; however, the person is currently suing the Word Perfect organization for &quot;termination without cause&quot;. This is from the taped conversation leading up to dismissal :<br />
<br />
&quot;Word Perfect Technical Desk, may I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well, I&#39;m having trouble with Word Perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of trouble?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well, I was just typing along, and all of a sudden the words went away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Went away?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;They disappeared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. So what does your screen look like now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;It&#39;s blank; it won&#39;t accept anything when I type.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still in Word Perfect, or did you get out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I tell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you see the C: prompt on the screen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a sea-prompt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind. Can you move the cursor around on the screen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There isn&#39;t any cursor: I told you, it won&#39;t accept anything I type&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does your monitor have a power indicator?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a monitor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the thing with the screen on it that looks like a TV.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it have a little light that tells you when it&#39;s on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then look on the back of the monitor and find where the power cord goes into it. Can you see that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. Follow the cord to the plug, and tell me if it&#39;s plugged into the wall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.......Yes, it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you were behind the monitor, did you notice that there were two cables plugged into the back of it, not just one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there are. I need you to look back there again and find the other cable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow it for me, and tell me if it&#39;s plugged securely into the back of your computer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t reach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh. Well, can you see if it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t have the right angle-it&#39;s because it&#39;s dark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes-the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the wind&#111;w.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, turn on the office light then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;No? Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because there&#39;s a power outage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A power... A power outage? Aha, Okay, we&#39;ve got it licked now. Do you still have the boxes and manuals and packing stuff your computer came in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, I keep them in the closet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Go get them, and unplug your system and pack it up just like it was when you got it. Then take it back to the store you bought it from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Is it that bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m afraid it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, all right then, I suppose. What do I tell them?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Tell them you&#39;re too stupid to own a computer.&quot;

				A woman awakes during the night to find that her husband was not in their bed. She puts on her robe and goes downstairs to look for him. She finds him sitting at the dining room table with a cup of coffee in front of him. He appears deep in thought, just staring at the wall. She watches as he wipes a tear from his eye and takes a sip of coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, dear?&quot; she whispers as she steps into the room, &quot;Why are you down here at this time of night?&quot;<br />
<br />
The husband looks up, &quot;Do you remember 20 years ago when we were dating, and you were only 18?&quot; he asks solemnly. The wife is touched to tears thinking that her husband is so caring and sensitive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I do&quot; she replies.<br />
<br />
The husband pauses. The words are not coming easily. &quot;Do you remember when your mother caught us behind the couch making love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I remember.&quot; says the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him. The husband continues...&quot;Do you remember when she shoved a shotgun in my face and said, &#39;Either you marry my daughter, or I will send you to jail for 20 years?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember that too.&quot; she replies softly.<br />
<br />
He wipes another tear from his cheek and says...&quot;I would have gotten out today.&quot;

				A little girl was talking to her teacher about whales.<br />
<br />
The teacher said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow<br />
a human because even though it was a very large mammal its throat was very small.<br />
<br />
The little girl stated that Jonah was swallowed by a whale.<br />
<br />
Irritated, the teacher reiterated that a whale could not swallow a<br />
human; it was physically impossible.<br />
<br />
The little girl said, &quot;When I get to heaven I will ask Jonah.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teacher asked, &quot;What if Jonah went to hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
The little girl replied, &quot;Then you ask him. &quot;

<br />
Here is a story I heard the other day.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know the Muslims don&#39;t recognize the Jews right to occupy Israel<br />
<br />
And that the Jews don&#39;t recognize Jesus as their saviour<br />
<br />
And the Catholics don&#39;t recognize the protestants as the true religion<br />
<br />
And the Protestants don&#39;t recognize the Mormons as Christians<br />
<br />
And the Mormons don&#39;t recognize each other.....at the liquor store or at Hooters&#33;&#33;

				An oldy but a goody&#33;<br />
<br />
The town drunk is walking past a 5 star restaurant when he sees a sign that sayâ€™s â€œPiano Player required&#33; Apply withinâ€. <br />
He stumbles through the door belching and farting, sits down at the grand piano and starts to play the most beautiful music ever heard in this particular restaurant. <br />
<br />
The proprietor immediately approaches the drunk and sayâ€™s â€œThis is the most fantastic piece of music that I have ever heard, who wrote it?â€ <br />
â€œI did&#33;â€ slurs the drunk, <span style='font-size: 15px;'>â€œItâ€™s called â€œLick My Nuts You Skanky Hoâ€ </span> .<br />
<br />
The proprietor is dumbfounded and asks to hear another original composition.<br />
The drunk complies with another â€œmore beautiful piece of musicâ€ that was truly stunning to listen to. <br />
The amazed proprietor compliments the drunk and again inquires about the name of this truly incredible music. <span style='font-size: 15px;'>â€œThis ones called â€œWhyâ€™d ya shit the bed ya slut&#33;â€ </span> replies the drunk. â€œI got a million of emâ€<br />
<br />
Thinking, the proprietor decides to give the drunk a chance at the job due to the fact that he was obviously a virtuoso and a musical genius. <br />
So the proprietor tells him that heâ€™ll pay him &#036;100 a night and give him all the beer he wants under the conditions that the drunk never tells anyone the name of any original composition and just shuts up and plays. The drunk agrees to this and promptly soils his pants.<br />
<br />
Later that evening the restaurant is full of paying customers that are dining to the most exquisite piano music that any of them had ever heard. <br />
The proprietor is completely happy and after two hours he decides that the drunk should have a 10 minute break and signals him to do so. <br />
The drunk immediately rushes to the menâ€™s room to relieve his beer soaked bladder. <br />
<br />
10 minutes later, as he was walking back to the piano, a young lady approaches him and timidly asks, â€œExcuse me sir, but do you know that your pants zipper is down and your dick is still hanging out?â€<br />
<br />
â€œKnow it?â€ replies the drunk, <span style='font-size: 15px;'>â€œI fucking wrote it&#33;â€</span>

				Mildred and Chester knew each other from childhood but were in their seventies when they got married. They had to wait for Mildred&#39;s mother to pass away first. Back in those days there was no hanky panky before marriage so Chester and Mildred were both still virgins.<br />
<br />
Needless to say Chester was pretty excited on their wedding night, having waited so patiently all these years. However, Mildred was very apprehensive as she had developed a heart condition and would have to tell Chester that they could not do it.<br />
<br />
Chester is now sitting on the bed wanting Mildred to hurry up. He detects a little reluctance on her part. Thinking that she is shy he sends her off to the bathroom to get undressed.<br />
<br />
When she reappears in her silk satin nightie, he gets her to sit next to him on the bed. Not knowing how to get things started he pulls the first strap on her nightie. She blushes just as red as her silk satin nightie. She is really concerned about telling Chester about her heart condition. <br />
<br />
In the meantime Chester is looking at the first breast he has seen since his own mother&#39;s. It is hanging there down to her belly button: gravity having taken it&#39;s course over some sixty years.<br />
<br />
He realises her anxiety but figures she is going have to be helped a little more. Now he pulls the second strap and sees the second breast unroll downward before him. Poor Mildred is now beside herself. She is going to have to tell Chester about her heart.<br />
<br />
With a quivering voice and mustering up all her courage, she says, &quot;Chester I have acute angina.&quot; Chester says, &quot;I sure hope so. Cuz you&#39;ve sure got ugly tits&#33;&quot;<br />

A young cowboy walks into a seedy cafe in Prescott, AZ. He sits at the counter and notices an old cowboy with his arms folded staring blankly at a full bowl of chilli. <br />
<br />
After fifteen minutes of just sitting there staring at it, the young cowboy bravely asks the old cowpoke, &quot;If you ain&#39;t gonna eat that, mind if I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
The older cowboy slowly turns his head toward the young wrangler and in his best cowboy manner drawls, &quot;No son, you go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eagerly, the young cowboy reaches out and slides the bowl over to his place and starts spooning it in with delight. He gets nearly down to the bottom and notices a dead mouse in the chilli. The sight was shocking and he immediately barfs up the chilli into the bowl. The old cowboy quietly drawls, &quot;Yep, that&#39;s as far as I got, too...&quot;<br />
<br />
A Mexican family was considering putting their Grandfather in a nursing home. All the Catholic facilities were completely full so they had to put him in a Jewish home. <br />
<br />
After a few weeks in the Jewish facility, they came to visit grandpa.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you like it here?&quot; asks the grandson. &quot;It&#39;s wonderful&#33; Everyone here is so courteous and<br />
Respectful,&quot; says grandpa. &quot;We&#39;re so happy for you. We were worried that this was the wrong place for you. You know, since you are a little different from everyone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no&#33; Let me tell you about how wonderfully they treat the residents here,&quot; grandpa says with a big smile. &quot;There&#39;s a musician here - he&#39;s 85 years old. He hasn&#39;t played the violin in 20 years and everyone still calls him &#39;Maestro&#39;&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a judge in here - he&#39;s 95 years old. He hasn&#39;t been on the bench in 30 years and everyone still calls him &#39;Your Honor&#39;&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there&#39;s a physician here -- 90 years old. He hasn&#39;t been practicing medicine for 25 years and everyone still calls him &#39;Doc&#39;&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And me... I haven&#39;t had sex for 35 years and they still call me &quot;The Fucking Mexican&quot;&#33;<br />
<br />
An upset woman storms into the golf pro shop and says to the clerk, &quot;I was just golfing on your course and I was stung by a bee right in between the first and second holes. What do you suggest I do?&quot; The clerk says, &quot;Well for starters lady I&#39;d suggest you narrow your stance a bit.&quot;<br />
--<br />
What is smoking, black, and at the top of the stairs? Christopher Reeves after a house-fire.<br />
--<br />
What did a Buddhist say to the hot dog vendor? Make me one with everything.<br />
<br />
I apogise now if anyone is offended by anything I post&#33;&#33;

<br />
<br />
The First Affair:<br />
<br />
A married man was having an affair  with his secretary. One day, their passions overcame them and they took off for  her house, where they made  passionate love all afternoon. Exhausted from the  wild sex, they fell asleep, awakening around 8:00 pm. As the man threw on his  clothes, he  told the woman to take his shoes outside and rub them through the  grass and dirt. Mystified, she nonetheless complied. He slipped into his  shoes and drove home. <br />
 &quot;Where have you been?&quot; demanded his wife when he  entered the house. <br />
 &quot;Darling, I can&#39;t lie to you. I&#39;ve been having an affair with  my secretary and we&#39;ve been having sex all afternoon. I fell asleep  and didn&#39;t wake up until eight o&#39;clock.&quot; <br />
 The wife glanced down at his shoes  and said, &quot;You lying bastard&#33; You&#39;ve been playing golf&#33;&quot;.<br />
<br />
The Second  Affair:<br />
<br />
There was a middle-aged couple that had two stunningly beautiful  teenage daughters. The couple decided to try one last time for the son they  always wanted. After months of trying, the wife finally got pregnant and  sure enough, delivered a healthy baby boy nine months later. The joyful  father rushed into the nursery to see his new son. He took one look and was  horrified to see the ugliest child he had ever seen. He went to his wife  and  told her there was no way he could be the father of that child. <br />
 &quot;Look at the  two beautiful daughters I fathered&#33;&quot; <br />
 Then he gave her a stern look and asked,  &quot;Have you been fooling around on me?&quot; <br />
 The wife just smiled sweetly and said,  &quot;Not this time&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
The Third Affair:<br />
<br />
A mortician was working late  one night. It was his job to examine the dead bodies before they were sent off  to be buried or cremated. As he examined the body of Mr. Schwartz, who was about  to be cremated, he made an amazing discovery. Schwartz had the longest  private part he had ever seen&#33; <br />
 &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Schwartz&quot;, said the mortician,  &quot;but I can&#39;t send you off to be cremated with a tremendously huge private part  like this. It has to be saved for posterity.&quot; <br />
 With that, the coroner used his  tools to remove  the dead man&#39;s scaling. He stuffed his prize into a briefcase  and took it home. The first person he showed it to was his wife. <br />
 &quot;I have  something to show you that you won&#39;t believe,&quot; he said, and opened up his  briefcase. <br />
 &quot;Oh my God&#33;&quot; the wife screamed, &quot;Schwartz is dead&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
The Fourth  Affair:<br />
<br />
A woman was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband  opening the front door. &quot;Hurry,&quot; she said, &quot;stand in the corner. Then she  quickly rubbed baby oil all over him and then dusted him with talcum powder.  <br />
 &quot;Don&#39;t move until I tell you to,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Just pretend you&#39;re a  statue.&quot; <br />
 &quot;What&#39;s this, honey?&quot; the husband inquired as he entered the room. <br />
 &quot;Oh,  it&#39;s a statue,&quot; she replied nonchalantly. &quot;The Smiths bought one for their  bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too.&quot; No more was said about the  statue, not even later when they went to sleep. Around two in the morning, the  husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a  sandwich and a glass of milk. <br />
 &quot;Here,&quot; he said to the statue, &quot;eat something. I  stood like an idiot at the Smiths for three days and nobody offered me as much  as a glass of water.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Fifth Affair:<br />
<br />
A man walks into a night  club one night. He goes up to the bar and asks for a beer. &quot;Certainly, Sir,  that&#39;ll be 1 cent.&quot; <br />
 &quot;One Cent?&quot;, exclaimed the man. So the man glances over at  the menu and asks, &quot;Could I have a nice juicy T-bone steak, with chips, peas and  a fried egg?&quot; <br />
 &quot;Certainly Sir,&quot; replies the barman, &quot;but that comes to real  money.&quot; <br />
 &quot;How much money?&quot; inquires the man. <br />
 &quot;4 cents,&quot; the bartender replied.  <br />
 &quot;Four Cents?&quot;, exclaimed the man. &quot;Where&#39;s the guy who owns this place?&quot; <br />
 The  bartender replied, &quot;Upstairs, with my wife.&quot; <br />
 The man says, &quot;What&#39;s he doing   upstairs with your wife?&quot;<br />
  The bartender replied, &quot;The same thing as I&#39;m  doing to his business.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Sixth Affair:<br />
<br />
Jake was dying. His  wife, Becky, was maintaining a candlelight vigil by his side. She held his  fragile hand, tears running down her face. Her praying roused him from his  slumber. He looked up and his pale lips began to move slightly. <br />
 &quot;Becky my  darling,&quot; he whispered. <br />
 &quot;Hush my love,&quot; she said. &quot;Rest, don&#39;t talk.&quot; <br />
 He was  insistent. &quot;Becky,&quot; he said in his tired voice, &quot;I have something that I must  confess.&quot; <br />
 &quot;There&#39;s nothing to confess,&quot; replied the weeping Becky, &quot;everything&#39;s  all right, go to sleep.&quot; <br />
 &quot;No, no. I must die in peace, Becky. I ... I slept with  your sister, your best friend, her best friend and your mother&#33;&quot; <br />
 &quot;I know, my  sweet one&quot; whispered Becky, &quot;that&#39;s why I poisoned  you.&quot;</span></span></span><br />

<br />
Many students, and other young people, have little in the way of cooking skills but can usually get their hands on a couple of mobile phones. So, this week, we show you how to use two mobile phones to cook an egg which will make a change from phoning out for a pizza. Please note that this will not work with cordless phones. </span></span></span>  <span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'>To do this you will need two mobile phones -they do not have to be on the same network but you will need to know the number of one of them. The only other items you will need are:<br />
<br />
  </span></span></span><br />
<br />
  <ul class='bbcol decimal'><li><span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'>An egg cup, (make sure that the egg cup is made of an insulating material such as China, wood or glass - plastic will do. DO NOT use stainless steel or other metal). </span></span></span><br /></li><li><span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'>A radio, AM or FM - you can also use your hifi.<br />
<br />
  </span></span></span><br /></li><li><span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'>A table or other flat surface on which to place the phones and egg cup. You can place the radio anywhere in the room but you might as well put it on the table. </span></span></span></li></ul>  <span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>How To Do It:</strong><br />
<br />
  </span></span></span>  <ul class='bbcol decimal'><li><span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'>Take an egg from the fridge and place it in the egg cup in the centre of the   table.  </span></span></span><br /></li><li><span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'>Switch on the radio or hifi and turn it up to a comfortable volume.  </span></span></span><br /></li><li><span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'>Switch on phone A and place it on the table such that the antenna (the pokey thing at the top) is about half an inch from the egg (you may need to experiment to get the relative heights correct - paperbacks are good if you have any - if not you may be able to get some wood off cuts from your local hardware shop). </span></span></span><br /></li><li><span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'>Switch on phone B and ring phone A then place phone B on the table in a   similar but complementary position to Phone A.  </span></span></span><br /></li><li><span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='color: black'>Answer phone A - you should be able to do this without removing it from the table.

				A guy walks into a bar and notices a very large jar on the counter and sees it&#39;s filled to the brim with &#036;10 bills... The man guesses there must be thousands of dollars in it&#33; <br />
<br />
He approaches the bartender and asks, &quot;What&#39;s up with the jar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you pay ten dollars... and IF you pass three tests...you get all the money&#33;&#33;&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
The man certainly isn&#39;t going to pass this up&#33; What are the three tests?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Pay FIRST...&quot; says the bartender... &quot;Those are the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the man gives him the &#036;10 and the bartender drops it into the jar...<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; the bartender says, &quot;here&#39;s what you need to do... <br />
<br />
FIRST: You have to drink that ENTIRE GALLON of pepper tequila... the WHOLE thing, all at ONCE... and you CAN&#39;T make a face while doing it...<br />
<br />
SECOND: There&#39;s a pit bull chained-up out back with a sore tooth...You have to REMOVE the tooth with your BARE HANDS... <br />
<br />
THIRD: There&#39;s a 90 year-old woman upstairs who has NEVER reached orgasm during intercourse... You&#39;ve gotta MAKE THINGS RIGHT for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man is stunned... &quot;I know I paid my 10 bucks... but I&#39;m not an IDIOT&#33; <br />
<br />
I WON&#39;T DO IT&#33;&#33;&#33; You have to be NUTS to drink a gallon of pepper tequila, and then do those OTHER THINGS&#33;&#33;&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your call,&quot; says the bartender, &quot;but, your MONEY stays where it is...&quot; <br />
<br />
The man has a few drinks... then a few more... Finally...he asks, &quot;WHERRRRE&#39;S ZAAAAT TEQUIIIIIILA?&#33;?&#33;?&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabs the gallon with both hands and downs it with a big slurp...Tears are streaming down both cheeks, but he doesn&#39;t make a face... <br />
<br />
Next... he staggers out back where the pit bull is chained-up...The people inside the bar hear a HUGE, NOISY SCUFFLE going on outside...They hear the pit bull barking... the guy screaming...the pit bull yelping .. and then.... <br />
<br />
SILENCE ..<br />
<br />
Just when they think the man SURELY must be dead, he staggers back into the bar ... with his shirt ripped... and large, bloody scratches all over his body... &quot;NOW&#33;......&quot; he says... <br />
<br />
&quot;WHERE&#39;S THE OLD WOMAN WITH THE SORE TOOTH ?&#33;?&#33;

				FEMALE PRAYER <br />
Before I lay me down to sleep, <br />
I pray for a man, who&#39;s not a creep, <br />
One who&#39;s handsome, smart and strong <br />
One who loves to listen long, <br />
One who thinks before he speaks, <br />
One who&#39;ll call, not wait for weeks. <br />
I pray he&#39;s gainfully employed, <br />
When I spend his cash, won&#39;t be annoyed. <br />
Pulls out my chair and opens my door, <br />
Massages my back and begs to do more. <br />
Oh&#33; Send me a man who&#39;ll make love to my mind, <br />
Knows what to answer to &quot;how big is my behind?&quot; <br />
I pray that this man will love me to no end, <br />
And always be my very best friend. <br />
Amen. <br />
 <br />
MALE PRAYER <br />
I pray for a deaf-mute nymphomaniac with huge boobs <br />
who owns a liquor store and a bass boat. <br />
This doesn&#39;t rhyme and I don&#39;t give a shit. <br />
Amen.

				Students were assigned to read 2 books, &quot;Titanic&quot; &amp; &quot;My Life&quot; by Bill Clinton. <br />
<br />
One smart ass student turned in the following book report, with the proposition that they were nearly identical stories. <br />
 <br />
His cool professor gave him an A+ for this report: <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    &#036;29.99 <br />
 <br />
Clinton:    &#036;29.99 <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    Over 3 hours to read <br />
 <br />
Clinton:    Over 3 hours to read <br />
 <br />
Titanic:  The story of Jack &amp; Rose, their forbidden love, and subsequent catastrophe. <br />
 <br />
Clinton:  The story of Bill and Monica, their forbidden love, and subsequent catastrophe. <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    Jack is a starving artist. <br />
 <br />
Clinton:    Bill is a bullshit artist. <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    In one scene, Jack enjoys a good cigar. <br />
 <br />
Clinton:    Ditto for Bill. <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    During ordeal, Rose&#39;s dress gets ruined. <br />
 <br />
Clinton:    Ditto for Monica. <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    Jack teaches Rose to spit. <br />
 <br />
Clinton:    Let&#39;s not go there. <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    Rose gets to keep her jewelry. <br />
 <br />
Clinton:    Monica&#39;s forced to return her gifts. <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    Rose remembers Jack for the rest of her life. <br />
 <br />
Clinton:    Clinton doesn&#39;t remember Jack....... <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    Rose goes down on a vessel full of seamen. <br />
 <br />
Clinton:    Monica.....ooh, let&#39;s not go there, either. <br />
 <br />
Titanic:    Jack surrenders to an icy death. <br />
 <br />

				A man walked into a supermarket with  his zipper down, and<br />
his fly wide open. A lady cashier walked up to him  and said,<br />
&quot;Your barracks door is open.&quot; <br />
<br />
This is not a phrase  men normally use, so he went on his way looking a bit  puzzled.<br />
When he was about done shopping, a man came up and  said,<br />
&quot;Your fly is open.&quot;<br />
<br />
He zipped up and finished his  shopping, and remembering what<br />
the cashier had told him, finally  understood. He then<br />
intentionally got in the line to check out where the  lady<br />
was that told him about his &quot;barracks door.&quot;<br />
<br />
He  was planning to have a little fun with her. When he<br />
reached her counter  he said, &quot;When you saw my barracks door<br />
open did you see a soldier  standing in there at attention?&quot;<br />
<br />
The lady thought for a moment and said,  &quot;No, no I didn&#39;t.<br />
All I saw was a disabled veteran sitting on two  duffel<br />
bags.&quot;

				Here&#39;s a little Valentines humor, written entirely by the lovely Dazed.<br />
<br />
<p class='citation'>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class='quote'>Top Ten Pregnancy Positions<br />
    Â©2006Laura Eitniear<br />
<br />
    10.) Valentine&#8217;s Position: This is when the baby positions itself in a headstand and kicks his feet into the bottom of your stomach, giving you heartburn.<br />
<br />
    9.) Lay-up Position: When the baby bounces what feels like a basketball on your bladder making you feel like you have to pee, no you don&#8217;t, yes you do, no you don&#8217;t, finally you do anyway just to be safe.<br />
<br />
    8.) Kickball Position: This is when the baby stands on your bladder, which is home base, then kicks your kidneys into the outfield.<br />
<br />
     7.) Sack the Stomach Position: When the baby comes off the line of scrimmage with head up and shoulders down sacking your full stomach, forcing you to vomit.<br />
<br />
     6.) Boxing Position: The baby uses the wall of your stomach as a punching bag, making your stomach appear as if it is the home of an alien.<br />
<br />
     5.) Pain in the Butt Position: The baby lies very comfortably within you, placing pressure on your sciatic nerve causing extreme pain in your buttocks and legs. Don&#8217;t worry, this is just a preview of years to come&#33;<br />
<br />
     4.) C Position: This is when the baby climbs into the lowest regions of your womb forcing your stomach to stick out to an incredible distance and your back takes on the shape of a letter C.<br />
<br />
    3.) Homerun Position: The baby finds great fun in batting your gall bladder into the outfield&#33;<br />
<br />
    2.) Swimming Position: The baby swims to the bottom of your womb causing your water to break, and forces you to swim to the nearest hospital.<br />
<br />
     And the Number One Pregnancy Position is:<br />
<br />
    1.) Peek-A-Boo Position: Just before birth, the doctor will place your feet in ice-cold stir-ups and the baby will play peek-a-boo with the doctor.</div></div>

THE CAT&#39;S  DIARY<br />
<br />
Day 183 of my captivity... My captors  continued to taunt me with<br />
bizarre little dangling  objects. They dine lavishly on fresh<br />
succulent meat,  while I am forced to eat dry, flavorless morsels. The <br />
only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the  mild<br />
satisfaction I get from clawing the  furniture.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow I may eat another house  plant.<br />
<br />
Today my attempt to kill my captors by  weaving around their feet <br />
while they were walking  almost succeeded - must try this at the top<br />
of the  stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile<br />
oppressors, I once again induced myself to vomit on their new  carpet<br />
- must try this on their bed.  <br />
<br />
Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless  body in an attempt<br />
to make them aware of what I am  capable of, and to try to strike fear<br />
in their hearts.  They only cooed and condescended about what a good <br />
little cat I was. Hmmm...not working according to  plan...<br />
<br />
There was some sort of gathering of their  accomplices. I was placed<br />
in solitary throughout the  event. However, I could hear the noise and<br />
smell the  food. More important, I overheard that my confinement was due to  <br />
my powers of inducing &quot;allergies&quot;; Must learn what this  is and consider<br />
how to use it to my  advantage.<br />
<br />
I am convinced the other captives are  flunkies and maybe snitches.<br />
The dog is routinely  released and seems more than happy to return. He <br />
is  obviously a half-wit. The bird, on the other hand, has got to be  an<br />
informant and speaks with them regularly. I am  certain he reports my<br />
every move. Due to his current  placement in the metal room, his safety is <br />
assured. But  I can wait - it is only a matter of time...

				Two missionaries in Africa were apprehended by a tribe of  very hostile <br />
cannibals who put them in a large pot of water, built a huge  fire under it, <br />
and left them there.<br />
<br />
    A few minutes later, one of the  missionaries started to laugh <br />
uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
    The other missionary  couldn&#39;t believe it&#33; He said, &#39;&#39;What&#39;s wrong with you? <br />

				Brian came home from the pub late one Friday evening stinking drunk, as<br />
<br />
He often did, and crept into bed beside his wife who was already asleep.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
He gave a peck on the cheek and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When he awoke he found a strange man standing at the end of his bed wearing a <br />
<br />
long flowing white robe. &quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; Demanded Brian, &quot;and what are <br />
<br />
you doing in my bedroom?&quot;.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The mysterious Man answered &quot;This isn&#39;t your bedroom and I&#39;m St Peter&quot;.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Brian was stunned &quot;You mean I&#39;m dead&#33;&#33;&#33; That can&#39;t be, I have so much to live for, <br />
<br />
I haven&#39;t said goodbye to my family...you&#39;ve got to send me back straight away&quot;.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
St Peter replied &quot;Yes you can be reincarnated but there is a catch. We<br />
<br />
can only send you back as a dog or a hen.&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Brian was devastated, but knowing there was a farm not far from his house, <br />
<br />
he asked to be sent back as a hen.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A flash of light later he was covered in feathers and clucking around<br />
<br />
pecking the ground. &quot;This ain&#39;t so bad&quot; he thought until he felt this<br />
<br />
strange feeling welling up inside him.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The farmyard rooster strolled over and said &quot;So you&#39;re the new hen, how<br />
<br />
Are you enjoying your first day here?&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not so bad&quot; replies Brian, &quot;but I have this strange feeling <br />
<br />
Inside like I&#39;m about to explode&quot;.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re ovulating&quot; explained the rooster, &quot;don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never<br />
<br />
Laid an egg before&quot;.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;Never&quot; replies Brian &quot;Well just relax and let it happen&quot; And so he did<br />
<br />
and after a few uncomfortable seconds later, an egg pops out from under his<br />
<br />
tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him and his emotions got<br />
<br />
the better of him as he experienced motherhood for the first time.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming<br />
<br />
and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that ever<br />
<br />
happened to him... ever&#33;&#33;&#33;<br />
<br />

				From an email...<br />
<br />
<p class='citation'>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class='quote'>Think before you speak...<br />
<br />
Here are six reasons why you should think before you speak - the last one is great&#33;  <br />
<br />
Have you ever spoken and wished that you could immediately take the words back...<br />
<br />
or that you could crawl into a hole?Here are the Testimonials of a few people who  did....<br />
<br />
FIRST  TESTIMONY:<br />
<br />
I walked into a  hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow and asked loudly, &quot;How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job?&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned around  and walked back out and never went back<br />
<br />
My husband didn&#39;t say a word...he knew better.<br />
<br />
SECOND  TESTIMONY:<br />
<br />
I was at the golf  store comparing different kinds of golf balls. I was unhappy with the  women&#39;s type I had been using. After browsing for several minutes, I was  approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen<br />
who works at the  store. He asked if he could help me.<br />
<br />
Without thinking, I looked at him and said,<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I like playing with men&#39;s balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
THIRD  TESTIMONY:<br />
<br />
My sister and I  were at the mall and passed by a store that sold avariety of candy and nuts. As we were looking at the display case, the boy behind the counter asked if we needed any help.<br />
<br />
I replied, &quot;No, I&#39;m just looking at your nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
My sister started to laugh hysterically.<br />
<br />
The boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked away.<br />
<br />
To this day, my sister has never let me forget.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
FOURTH TESTIMONY:<br />
<br />
While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release some pent-up energy and ran amok I was finally able to grab hold of her after receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other patrons. I told her that if she did not start behaving &quot;right now&quot; she would be punished.<br />
<br />
To my horror, she looked me in the eye and said in avoice just as threatening,<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t let me go right now, I will tell Grandma that I saw you kissing Daddy&#39;s pee-pee last night&#33;&quot; <br />
<br />
The silence was deafening after this enlightening exchange. Even the tellers stopped  what they were doing. I mustered up the last of my dignity and walked out of the bank with my daughter in tow.<br />
<br />
The last thing I heard when the door closed behind me, were screams of  laughter.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
FIFTH  TESTIMONY:<br />
<br />
Have you ever asked  your child a question too many times?<br />
<br />
My three-year-old son had a lot of  problems with potty training and I was on him constantly. One day we  stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in between errands. It was very busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying my taco, I smelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven-month-old daughter, she was clean. The realized that Danny had not asked to go potty in a while. I asked him if he needed to go, and he said &quot;No&quot;. I  kept thinking &quot;Oh Lord, that child has had an accident, and I don&#39;t  have any clothes with me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then I said, &quot;Danny, are you SURE you didn&#39;t have an accident?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
 I just KNEW that he  must have had an accident, because the smell was getting worse.  <br />
<br />
Soooooo, I asked one more time, &quot;Danny, did you have an accident?&quot;  <br />
<br />
This time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over, spread his cheeks and yelled &quot;SEE MOM, IT&#39;S JUST FARTS&#33;&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
While 30 people  nearly  choked to death on their tacos laughing, he calmly pulled up his pants and sat down. An old couple made me feel better, thanking me for the  best laugh they&#39;d ever had&#33;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
LAST BUT NOT LEAST TESTIMONY:<br />
<br />
This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days and a very embarrassed  female news anchor who will, in the future, likely think before she  speaks.<br />
<br />
What happens when you predict snow but don&#39;t get any&#33; <br />
<br />
We had a female news anchor that, the day after it was supposed to have snowed and didn&#39;t, turned to the weatherman and asked:<br />
<br />
&quot;So Bob, where&#39;s that 8 inches you promised me last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not only did HE have to leave the set, but half the crew did too they were laughing so hard&#33;</div></div>

				A tour bus driver is driving with a bus load of seniors down a highway when he is tapped on his shoulder by a little old lady.<br />
She offers him a handful of peanuts,   <br />
which he gratefully munches up.<br />
<br />
After about 15 minutes, she taps him on his shoulder <br />
again and she hands him another handful of peanuts.   <br />
She repeats this gesture about five more times. <br />
<br />
When she is about to hand him another batch again he asks the little old lady, &quot; why don&#39;t you eat the peanuts yourself?&quot;. <br />
&quot;We can&#39;t chew them because we&#39;ve no teeth&quot;, she replied. <br />
<br />
The puzzled driver asks,<br />
&quot;Why do you buy them then?&quot;<br />
The old lady replied,   <br />
&quot;We just love the chocolate around them.&quot;

				A man died and went to heaven. As he stood in front of St. Peter at the Pearly Gates, he saw a huge wall of clocks behind him.

Every time you lie the hands on your clock will move.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot;said the man, &quot;whose clock is that?&quot; &quot;That&#39;s Mother Teresa&#39;s.

 <p class='citation'>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class='quote'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'> Upgrading to Wife 1.0 					</strong></span>   					<br />
 <br />
     Last year a friend of mine upgraded from Girlfriend 4.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that it&#39;s a memory hog leaving few system resources for other applications.  He is also now noticing the Wife 1.0 is also spawning Child-processes which are further consuming valuable resources. No mention of this particular phenomenon was included in the product documentation, though other users have informed me that this is to be expected due to the nature of the application.  Not only that,  Wife 1.0 installs itself so that it  is always launched at system initialization where it can monitor all other system activity.  Some applications such as PokerNite 10.3 , Bachelor Party 2.5, and Pubnite 7.0 are no longer able to run on the system at all, causing the system to lockup when launched  (even though the apps worked fine before). <br />
<br />
  Wife 1.0 provides no installation options.  Thus, the installation of undesired plug-ins such as Mother-in-law 55.8 and the Brother-in-law Beta is unavoidable.  Also, system performance seems  to diminish with each passing day. <br />
<br />
  Some features my friend would like to see in the upcoming Wife 2.0: <br />
<br />
 <ul class='bbc'><li>A &quot;don&#39;t remind me again&quot; button.<br /></li><li>Minimize button.<br /></li><li>Ability to delete the &quot;headache&quot; file<br /></li><li>An install feature that provides an option to uninstall 2.0 version without loss loss of other system resources.<br /></li><li>An option to run the network driver in &quot;promiscuous mode&quot; allowing the the system&#39;s Hardware Probe feature to be much more useful/effective.</li></ul>   I myself wish I had decided to avoid all of the headaches associated with Wife 1.0 by sticking with Girlfriend 3.0  Even here, however, I have found many problems.  Apparently you cannot install Girlfriend 4.0 on top of girlfriend 3.0.  You must uninstall Girlfriend 3.0 first, otherwise the two versions of Girlfriend will have conflicts over shared use of the I/O port. Other users have told me that this is a long-standing problem that I should have been aware of.  Guess that explains what happened to versions 1 and 2. <br />
<br />
  To make matters worse, the uninstall program for Girlfriend 3.0 doesn&#39;t work very well, leaving undesirable traces of the application in the system. Another identified problem is that all versions of Girlfriend  have annoying little messages about the advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0&#33; <br />
<br />
  <strong class='bbc'>VIRUS &#097;lert</strong> <br />
<br />
  All users should be aware that Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug.  If you try to install Mistress 1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself.  Once that happens, Mistress 1.1 won&#39;t install and you will get an &quot;insufficient resources&quot; error message.  To avoid the aforementioned bug, try installing Mistress 1.1 on a different system and &quot; never&quot; run any file transfer applications(such as Laplink) between the two systems. <br />
<br />
  FYI: Don&#39;t even think about a shared directory&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;  <br />

				I guess there&#39;s an &quot;Upgrade&quot; to the previous joke&#33;  LMAO<br />
 <br />
 <p class='citation'>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class='quote'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><strong class='bbc'> Male Friend Needs Technical Support 					</strong></span>   					<br />
 <br />
    <em class='bbc'>Sequel to <a href='http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article09-132' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Upgrading to Wife 1.0</a>.</em>  Can you please advise me.  I&#39;m having some problems.  I&#39;m currently running the latest version of Girlfriend and I&#39;ve been having some problems lately.  I&#39;ve been running the same version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 all along as my primary application, and all the girlfriend releases have always conflicted with it.  I hear that DrinkingBuddies won&#39;t crash if you run girlfriend in background mode with the sound turned off.  But I&#39;m embarrassed to say I can&#39;t find the switch to turn the sound off.  I just run them separately, and it works okay.  Girlfriend also seems to have a problem coexisting with my Golf program, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing incompatibility.  I probably should have stayed with girlfriend 1.0, but I thought I might see better performance with GirlFriend 2.0. After months of conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with GirlFriend 2.0. He said that I probably didn&#39;t have enough cache to run girlfriend 2.0, and that eventually it would require a Token ring to run properly.  He was right --- as soon as I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself.  Shortly after that, I installed girlfriend 3.0 beta.  All the bugs were supposed to be gone, but the first time I used it gave me a virus.  I had to clean out my whole system and shut down for a while. <br />
<br />
 I very cautiously upgraded to girlfriend 4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection program.  It worked okay for a while until I discovered that GirlFriend 1.0 was still in my system&#33;  Then I tried to run GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature that I didn&#39;t know about that automatically senses the presence of any other version of girlfriend and communicates with it in some way, which results in the immediate removal of both versions&#33;  The version I have right now works pretty well, but there are still some problems.  Like all versions of girlfriend, it is written in some obscure language that I can&#39;t understand, much less reprogram.  Frankly, I think there is too much attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality.  Also, to get the best connections with your hardware, you usually have to use gold-plated contacts.  And I&#39;ve never liked how GirlFriend is totally &quot;object-oriented&quot;.  A year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus 1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend.  He discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don&#39;t upgrade to Fiancee 1.0. So he did.  But soon after that, he had to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a &quot;huge resource hog&quot;.  It has taken up all of his space, so he can&#39;t load anything else.  One of the primary reasons that he upgraded to Wife 1.0 is that it came bundled with FreeSexPlus 1.0. Well, it turns out that the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits access to FreesexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try.  On top of that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he can do anything.  Although -he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 came with MotherInLaw 1.0 which has an automatic pop-up feature that he can&#39;t turn off.  I told him to try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said that he heard if you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself, Then Mistress 1.0 won&#39;t install anyway due to insufficient resources.  Can you help??</div></div>

				At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated, &quot;If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving &#036;25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon.&quot;<br />
<br />
In response to Bill&#39;s comments, General Motors issued a press release stating: If GM had developed technology like&#33; Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics <br />
(and I just love this part):<br />
<br />
1. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash twice a day.<br />
<br />
2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.<br />
<br />
3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason. You would have to pull to the side of the road, close all of the windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the windows before you could continue. For some reason you would simply accept this.<br />
<br />
4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.<br />
<br />
5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast and twice as easy to drive -- but would run on only five percent of the roads.<br />
<br />
6. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning lights would all be replaced by a single &quot;This Car Has Performed An Illegal Operation&quot; warning light.<br />
<br />
7. The airbag system would ask &quot;Are you sure?&quot; before deploying.<br />
<br />
8. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.<br />
<br />
9. Every time a new car was introduced car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.<br />
<br />
10. You&#39;d have to press the &quot;Start&quot; button to turn the engine off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Girlfriend 1.0 (15)<br />
<br />
&quot;Eighteen months ago, I upgraded to GirlFriend 1.0 from DrinkingMates 4.2, which I had used for years without any trouble. However, there are apparently conflicts between these two products and the only solution was to try and run GirlFriend 1.0 with the sound turned off. To make matters worse, GirlFriend 1.0 is incompatible with several other applications, such as LadsNightOut 3.1, Football 4.5, and Playboy 6.9. <br />
<br />
&quot;Successive versions of GirlFriend proved no better. I tried a shareware program, Screemer 2.1, but it had many bugs and left a virus in my system, forcing me to shut down completely for several weeks. Eventually, I tried to run GirlFriend 1.2 and Girlfriend 1.0 at the same time, only to discover that when these two systems detected each other, they caused severe damage to my hardware. I eventually upgraded to FiancÃ©e 1.0, only to discover that this product soon had to be upgraded further to Wife 1.0. While Wife 1.0 tends to use up all my available resources, it does come bundled with Getsome Plus and Cleanhouse2003.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shortly after this upgrade, however, I found that Wife 1.0 could be very unstable and costly to run. Any mistakes I made were automatically stored in Wife 1.0&#39;s memory and could not be deleted. They then resurfaced months later when I had forgotten about them. Wife 1.0 also has an automatic Diary, Explorer and E-mail Filter, and can, without warning, launch TurboStrop and Whinge. These latter products have no Help files, and I have to try to guess what the problem is. <br />
<br />
&quot;Additional problems are that Wife 1.0 needs updating regularly, requiring ShoeShop Browser for new attachments and Hairstyle Express which needs to be reinstalled every other week. Wife 1.0 also spawns unwelcome child processes that drain my resources. These conflict with some of the new games I wanted to try out, warning me that they are an illegal operation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Also, when Wife 1.0 attaches itself to my Audi TT hard drive, it often crashes. Wife 1.0 also comes with an irritating pop-up called Mother-In-Law, which can&#39;t be turned off. Recently I&#39;ve been tempted to install Mistress 2003, but there could be problems. A friend of mine has &#097;lerted me to the fact that if Wife 1.0 detects Mistress 2003, it tends to delete all of your Money before uninstalling itself.&quot;

 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>Addressing the ceiling he shouted: &quot;God, if you are real, then I want you to knock me off this platform. I&#39;ll give you 15 minutes&#33;&quot;<br />
 </span></span><br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>The lecture room fell silent.</span></span><br />
<br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>You could have heard a pin fall.<br />
 </span></span><br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>Ten minutes went by.<br />
 </span></span><br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>Again he taunted God, saying, &quot;Here I am, God. I&#39;m still waiting.&quot;<br />
 </span></span><br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>His countdown got down to the last couple of minutes when a Marine just released from active duty and newly registered in the class walked up to the professor, hit him full force in the face, and sent him tail over teacup from his lofty platform.<br />
 </span></span><br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>The professor was out cold&#33;<br />
 </span></span><br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>At first the students were shocked and babbled in confusion.  </span></span><br />
<br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>The young Marine took a seat in the front row and sat silent.  </span></span><br />
<br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>The class fell silent...waiting.<br />
 </span></span><br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>Eventually, the professor came to, shaken.</span></span><br />
<br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>He looked at the young Marine in the front row.<br />
 </span></span><br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>When he regained his senses and could speak he yelled, &quot;What&#39;s the matter  with you? Why did you do that?&quot;<br />
 </span></span><br />
 <span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>&quot;God was busy. He sent me.&quot; </span></span>

				John O&#39;Reilly hoisted his beer and said, <br />
&quot;Here&#39;s to spending the rest of me life, between the legs of me wife&#33;&quot;<br />
That won him the top prize at the pub for the best toast of the night&#33;<br />
He went home and told his wife, Mary, &quot;I won the prize for the Best <br />
toast of the night&quot;<br />
She said, &quot;Aye, did ye now. And what was your toast?&quot;<br />
John said, &quot;Here&#39;s to spending the rest of me life, sitting in church <br />
beside me wife.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, that is very nice indeed, John&#33;&quot; Mary said.<br />
The next day, Mary ran into one of John&#39;s drinking buddies on the street <br />
corner. <br />
The man chuckled leeringly and said, &quot;John won the prize the other night <br />
at the pub with a toast about you, Mary.&quot;<br />
 She said,  &quot;Aye, he told me, and I was a bit surprised myself.  You <br />
know, he&#39;s only been there twice in the last four years. Once he fell <br />
asleep, and the other time I had to pull him by the ears to make him <br />
come.&quot;

				Give The Frog A Loan<br />
<br />
A frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller. He can see from her<br />
nameplate that her name is Patricia Whack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Whack, I&#39;d like to get a &#036;30,000 loan to take a holiday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Patty looks at the frog in disbelief and asks his name. The frog says his<br />
name is Kermit Jagger, his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it&#39;s okay, he knows<br />
the bank manager.<br />
<br />
Patty explains that he will need to secure the loan with some collateral.<br />
<br />
The frog says, &quot;Sure. I have this,&quot; and produces a tiny porcelain elephant,<br />
about an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly formed.<br />
<br />
Very confused, Patty explains that she&#39;ll have to consult with the bank<br />
manager and disappears into a back office.<br />
<br />
She finds the manager and says, &quot;There&#39;s a frog called Kermit Jagger out<br />
there who claims to know you and wants to borrow &#036;30,000, and he wants to<br />
use this as collateral.&quot;<br />
<br />
She holds up the tiny pink elephant. &quot;I mean, what in the world is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
(you&#39;re gonna love this)<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;(its a real treat)<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;(a masterpiece)<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;(wait for it)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The bank manager looks back at her and says...<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a knickknack, Patty Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man&#39;s a Rolling Stone.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(You&#39;re singing it, aren&#39;t you?  Yeah, I know you are........)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Never take life too seriously&#33; Come on now, you grinned, I know you did&#33;&#33;&#33;

				Dear President  Bush:<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;I&#39;m about to plan a  little trip with my family and<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;extended family, and I would like to ask you to  assist<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;me. I&#39;m going to walk  across the border from the U.S.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;into Mexico, and I need to make a few arrangements.  I<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;know you can help with  this.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;I plan to skip all the  legal stuff like visas,<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;passports, immigration quotas and laws. I&#39;m sure  they<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;handle those things the  same way you do here.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;So, would you mind  telling your buddy, President<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;Vicente Fox, that I&#39;m on my way over? Please let  him<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;know that I will be  expecting the following:<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;1. Free medical care  for my entire family.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;2. English-speaking  government bureaucrats for all<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;services I might need, whether I use them or  not.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;3. All government forms  need to be printed in English.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;4. I want my kids to be  taught by English-speaking<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;teachers.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;5. Schools need to  include classes on American  culture<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;and  history.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;6. I want my kids to  see the American flag flying on<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;the top of the flag pole at their school with  the<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;Mexican flag flying  lower down.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;7. Please plan to feed  my kids at school for both<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;breakfast and lunch.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;8. I will need a local  Mexican driver&#39;s license so I<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;can get easy access to government  services.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;9. I do not plan to  have any car insurance, and I<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;won&#39;t make any effort to learn local traffic  laws.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;10. In case one of the  Mexican police officers does<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;not get the memo from Pres. Fox to leave me  alone,<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;please be sure that  all police officers speak  English.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;11. I plan to fly the  U.S. flag from my house top, put<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;flag decals on my car and have a gigantic  celebration<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;on July 4th. I  do not want any complaints or  negative<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;comments from the  locals.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;12. I would also like  to have a nice job without<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;paying any taxes, and don&#39;t enforce any labor laws  or<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;tax  laws.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;13. Please tell all the  people in the country to be<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;extremely nice and never say a critical word about  me,<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;or about the strain I  might place on the economy.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;I know this is an easy  request because you already do<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;all these things for all the people who come to  the<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;U.S. from Mexico.   I am sure that Pres. Fox won&#39;t  mind<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;returning the favor if  you ask him nicely.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;However, if he gives  you any trouble, just invite him<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;to go quail hunting with your  V.P.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;       &gt;Thank you so much for  your kind help.<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;Sincerely,<br />
&gt; &gt;&gt;        &gt;<br />

YOU KNOW YOU&#39;RE FROM NEW YORK WHEN...<br />
<br />
YOU&#39;RE 35 YEARS OLD AND DON&#39;T HAVE A DRIVER&#39;S LICENSE.<br />
<br />
YOU GET READY TO ORDER DINNER EVERY NIGHT AND MUST CHOOSE FROM THE MAJOR <br />
FOOD GROUPS WHICH ARE: CHINESE, ITALIAN, MEXICAN OR INDIAN.<br />
<br />
YOU RIDE IN A SUBWAY CAR WITH NO AIR<br />
CONDITIONING JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SEATS AVAILABLE.<br />
<br />
YOU TAKE THE TRAIN HOME AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE ON THE PLATFORM THE <br />
DOORS WILL OPEN THAT WILL LEAVE YOU RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE EXIT STAIRWAY.<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW WHAT A &quot;REGULAR&quot; COFFEE IS.<br />
<br />
IT&#39;S NOT &#39;MANHATTAN&#39; - IT&#39;S THE &quot;CITY&quot;.<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO NORTH AND SOUTH. IT&#39;S &quot;UPTOWN&quot; OR &quot;DOWNTOWN.&quot; IF YOU&#39;RE <br />
REALLY FROM NEW YORK YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONCEPT OF WHERE NORTH AND <br />
SOUTH ARE.... (AND EAST OR WEST IS &quot;CROSSTOWN&quot;&#33;)<br />
<br />
YOU CROSS THE STREET ANYWHERE BUT ON THE CORNERS AND YOU YELL AT CARS <br />
FOR NOT RESPECTING YOUR RIGHT TO DO IT.<br />
<br />
YOU MOVE 3,000 MILES AWAY, SPEND 10 YEARS LEARNING THE LOCAL LANGUAGE <br />
AND PEOPLE STILL KNOW YOU&#39;RE FROM HERE THE MINUTE YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH.<br />
<br />
YOU RETURN AFTER 10 YEARS AND THE FIRST FOOD YOU WANT IS A &quot;REAL&quot; PIZZA.<br />
<br />
YOU&#39;RE NOT THE LEAST BIT INTERESTED IN GOING TO TIMES SQUARE ON NEW <br />
YEAR&#39;S EVE.<br />
<br />
YOUR INTERNAL CLOCK IS PERMANENTLY SET TO KNOW WHEN ALTERNATE SIDE OF <br />
THE STREET PARKING REGULATIONS ARE IN EFFECT.<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW WHAT A BODEGA IS.<br />
<br />
SOMEONE BUMPS INTO YOU, AND YOU CHECK FOR YOUR WALLET.<br />
<br />
YOU DON&#39;T EVEN NOTICE THE LADY WALKING DOWN THE ROAD HAVING A PERFECTLY <br />
NORMAL CONVERSATION WITH HERSELF.<br />
<br />
YOU CRINGE AT HEARING PEOPLE PRONOUNCE HOUSTON ST. LIKE THE CITY IN <br />
TEXAS.<br />
<br />
THE PRESIDENTIAL VISIT IS A MAJOR TRAFFIC JAM, NOT AN HONOR.<br />
<br />

				From an email I got today.  <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>Subject: I miss Bill Clinton<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn&#39;t matter what party you belong to - this is hilarious. From a show on Canadian TV there was a black comedian who said he misses Bill Clinton. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, that&#39;s right - I miss Bill Clinton&#33; He was the closest thing we ever  got to having a black man as President. Number  1 - He played the sax. Number  2 - He smoked weed. Number 3 - He had his way with ugly white women. Even now? Look at him... his wife works, and he don&#39;t&#33;  And, he gets a check from the government every month. Manufacturers announced today that they will be stocking America&#39;s shelves this week with &quot;Clinton Soup,&quot; in honor of one of the nations&#39; most distinguished men. It consists primarily of a weenie in hot water. Chrysler Corporation is adding a new car to its line to honor Bill Clinton.  The Dodge Drafter will be built in Canada. When asked what he thought about foreign affairs,  Clinton replied, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I never had one.&quot; The Clinton revised judicial oath: &quot;I solemnly swear to tell the truth as I know it, the whole truth as I believe it to be, and nothing but what I think you need to know.&quot; Clinton will be recorded in history as the only President to do Hanky Panky between Bushes.&quot;</strong>

				A Plan to save bankrupt airlines:<br />
<br />
Replace all female flight attendants with some good-lookin&#39;<br />
strippers&#33; What the hell? The attendants have gotten old and<br />
haggard-looking. They don&#39;t even serve food anymore, so what&#39;s the<br />
loss?<br />
<br />
The strippers would double, triple, perhaps quadruple the alcohol<br />
consumption and get a &quot;party atmosphere&quot; going in the cabin. And,<br />
of course, every heterosexual businessman in this country would<br />
start flying again, hoping to see naked women.<br />
<br />
Muslims would be afraid to get on the planes for fear of seeing naked<br />
women. Hijackings would come to a screeching halt and the airline   <br />
industry would see record revenues.<br />
<br />
Why the hell didn&#39;t Bush think of this? Why do I still have to do<br />
everything myself?<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Bill Clinton

Dear Tide Company, <br />
 <br />
I am writing to say what an excellent product you have&#33; I&#39;ve used it all  <br />
through my life, as my Mom always told me it was the best. Now that I <br />
am in my fifties, I find it even better&#33;  <br />
  <br />
In fact, about a month ago, I spilled some red wine on my new white blouse.   <br />
My inconsiderate and uncaring husband started to berate me about how clumsy  <br />
I was, and generally started becoming a pain in the neck. One thing led to  <br />
another, and somehow I ended up with a lot of his blood on my white blouse. <br />
 <br />
I tried to get the stain out using a bargain detergent, but it just wouldn&#39;t come  <br />
out. After a quick trip to the supermarket, I purchased a bottle of liquid Tide  <br />
with bleach alternative, and to my surprise and satisfaction, all of the stains  <br />
came out&#33;  <br />
  <br />
In fact, the stains came out so well the detectives who came by yesterday told  <br />
me that the DNA tests on my blouse were negative, and then my attorney called  <br />
and said that I would no longer be considered a suspect in the disappearance of  <br />
my husband. <br />
 <br />
What a relief&#33; Going through menopause is bad enough without being a murder  <br />
suspect&#33; I thank you, once again, for having such a great product. <br />
 <br />
Well, gotta go. I have to write a letter to the Hefty bag people. <br />
   <br />
Have a nice day&#33;

				A dedicated UAW union worker was attending a convention in Las Vegas and <br />
decided to check out the local brothels. <br />
<br />
When he got to the first one, he asked the Madam, &quot;Is this a union <br />
house?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she replied, &quot;I&#39;m sorry it isn&#39;t.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I pay you &#036;100, what cut do the girls get?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The house gets &#036;80 and the girls get &#036;20,&quot; she answered. Mightily <br />
offended at such unfair dealings, the union man stomped off down the <br />
street in search of a more equitable, hopefully unionized shop. <br />
<br />
His search continued until finally he reached a brothel where the Madam <br />
responded, &quot;Why yes sir, this is a union house. We observe all union <br />
rules.&quot; <br />
<br />
The man asked, &quot;And if I pay you &#036;100, what cut do the girls get?&quot; <br />
<br />
The girls get &#036;80 and the house gets &#036;20.&quot;That&#39;s more like it&#33;&quot; the <br />
union man said. He handed the Madam &#036;100, looked around the room, and <br />
pointed to a stunningly attractive blonde. &quot;I&#39;d like her,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
I&#39;m sure you would, sir,&quot; said the Madam. Then she gestured to a 92-year <br />
old woman in the corner, &quot;but Ethel here has 67 years seniority and <br />
according to union rules, she&#39;s next.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#96;<br />
<br />
<br />
UCLA Study<br />
<br />
A study conducted by UCLA&#39;s Department of Psychiatry<br />
has revealed that the kind of face a woman finds<br />
attractive on a man can differ depending on where she<br />
is in her menstrual cycle.<br />
For example, if she is ovulating, she is attracted to<br />
men with rugged and masculine features.<br />
However, if she is menstruating, or menopausal, she<br />
tends to be more attracted to a man with scissors<br />
lodged in his temple and tape over his mouth while he<br />
is on fire.<br />
No further studies are expected.

				Two men are drinking heavily in a bar located on the top floor of a hotel. <br />
 <br />
The first man turns to the second man and says, &quot;You know, they&#39;ve had some real problems with drunkards jumping off the balcony of this hotel and killing themselves.&quot; <br />
&quot;Really?&quot; replies the second man. <br />
&quot;Sure.  In fact, they installed this anti-gravity device that beams anyone who jumps off this floor back to the top.&quot; <br />
&quot;That&#39;s rubbish&#33;&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll bet you 50 pounds I&#39;m right&#33;&quot; says the first man. <br />
&quot;You&#39;re on&#33;&quot; <br />
 <br />
The first man runs to the balcony, jumps, and falls 5...10...15 floors then STOPS and -- in mid-air -- slowly floats back to the top floor. <br />
 <br />
The second man gives him the 50 pounds, astounded.  He then wants to test the device himself.  The second man jumps and falls 5...10...15...20...SPLAT&#33; <br />
 <br />
The first man walks back to the bar.  The bartender comes up to him and says: <br />
 <br />
&quot;Superman, you make a mean drunk&#33;&quot; <br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
Here&#39;s a truly  heartwarming story about the bond formed between a little <br />
5 year old  girl and some construction workers that makes you believe that we CAN  make a difference when we give a child the gift of our time... <br />
  <br />
A  young family moved into a house, next door to a vacant lot. One day  a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty  lot. <br />
  <br />
The young family&#39;s 5-year-old daughter naturally took an  interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each  day observing the workers. <br />
  <br />
Eventually, the construction crew,  all of them gems-in-the-rough, more or less adopted her as a kind of  project mascot. They chatted with her, let her sit with them while they  had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and  there to make her feel important. <br />
  <br />
At the end of the first week...  they even presented her with a pay envelope containing a couple of  dollars. The little girl took this home to her mother who said all the  appropriate words of admiration and suggested that they take the two  dollar &quot;pay&quot; she had received to the bank the next day to start a  savings account. <br />
  <br />
When they got to the bank, the teller was equally  impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own  pay check at such a young age. <br />
  <br />
The little girl proudly replied,  &quot;I worked last week with the crew building the house next door to  us.&quot; <br />
  <br />
My goodness gracious,&quot; said the teller, &quot;and will you be working on the house again this week, too?&quot; <br />
  <br />
The little girl  replied, &quot;I will if those assholes at Home Depot ever deliver the  f%*#ing sheet rock...&quot; <br />
  <br />
Kind of brings a tear to the eye.

				The Only Way Is Up<br />
<br />
<br />
In Pharmacology, all drugs have two names, a trade name and generic<br />
name. For example, the trade name of Tylenol also has a generic name<br />
of Acetaminophen. Aleve is also called Naproxen. Amoxil is also call<br />
Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.<br />
<br />
The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra. After careful<br />
consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced<br />
that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin. <br />
Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and<br />
of course, Ibepokin. <br />
<br />
Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in<br />
liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage<br />
suitable for use as a mixer. It will now be possible for a man to<br />
literally pour himself a stiff one. <br />
<br />
Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new <br />
meaning to the names of cocktails, highballs and just a good <br />
old-fashioned stiff drink. Pepsi will market<br />
the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT &amp; DO.<br />
<br />
Thought for the day: There is more money being spent on breast<br />
implants and Viagra today than on Alzheimer&#39;s research. This means<br />
that by 2040, there should be a large elderly population with perky<br />
boobs and huge erections and absolutely no recollection of what to do with them.

				With apologies to my southern accountant little brother. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Oil Field Explained... A Few Good Men<br />
<br />
Operations : &quot;You want answers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Accounting: &quot;I think we are entitled to them&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
Operations : &quot;You want answers?&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
Accounting : &quot;I want the truth&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
Operations : &quot;You can&#39;t handle the truth&#33;&#33;&#33;&quot; &quot;Son, we live in a world that requires revenue. And that revenue must be brought in by people with elite skills. Who&#39;s going to find it? You? You, Mr. Accountant? We have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom.<br />
<br />
You scoff at operations and you curse our lucrative incentives. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what we know: that while the cost of business results are excessive, it drives in revenue. And my very existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, drives REVENUE&#33; You don&#39;t want to know the truth because deep down in places you don&#39;t talk about at staff meetings ... you want me on that well. You NEED me on that well&#33;<br />
<br />
We use words like drilling, wellbore, fracture stimulation, lease automatic custody transfer, pumping unit and flow rate. We use these words as the backbone of a life spent building something. You use them as a punch line&#33;<br />
<br />
I have neither the time nor inclination to explain myself to people who rise and sleep under the very blanket of revenue I provide and then question the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said &quot;thank you&quot; and went on your way. Otherwise I suggest you contract a drilling rig and drill some wells. Either way, I don&#39;t give a damn what you think you&#39;re entitled to&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
Accounting : &quot;Did you expense the lap dances?&quot;<br />
<br />
Operations: &quot;I did the job I was hired to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Accounting : &quot;Did you expense the lap dances&#33;?&quot;<br />
<br />
Operations : &quot;You&#39;re goddamn right I did&#33;&quot;

				<span style='font-size: 15px;'>THREE THINGS TO THINK &#097;bout:<br />
1. COWS,<br />
2. THE CONSTITUTION, and<br />
3. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS<br />
<br />
COWS<br />
Is it just me, or does anyone else find it amazing that our government<br />
can track a cow born in Canada almost three years ago, right to the<br />
stall where she sleeps in the state of Washington? And, they tracked<br />
her calves to their stalls. But they are unable to locate 11 million<br />
illegal aliens wandering around our country. Maybe we should give them<br />
all a cow.<br />
<br />
THE CONSTITUTION<br />
They keep talking about drafting a Constitution for Iraq. Why don&#39;t we<br />
just give them ours? It was written by a lot of really smart guys,<br />
it&#39;s worked for over 200 years and we&#39;re not using it anymore.<br />
<br />
TEN COMMANDMENTS<br />
The real reason that we can&#39;t have the Ten Commandments in a<br />
courthouse........ You cannot post &quot;Thou Shalt Not Steal,&quot; &quot;Thou Shalt<br />
Not Commit Adultery&quot; and &quot;Thou Shall Not Lie&quot; in a building full of<br />
lawyers, judges and politicians -- it creates a hostile work<br />
environment.</span>

<br />
ST. PETERS, Mo. - A woman angry that her new puppy had died pushed her way into a dog breeder&#39;s home and repeatedly hit her on the head with the dead Chihuahua, authorities said.<br />
<br />
The 33-year-old woman told police she had taken the puppy to a veterinarian, who said it was only 4 weeks old and needed to be returned to its mother. But before she could return the puppy, it died.<br />
<br />
Early Wednesday, the woman went to the breeder&#39;s home, pushed her way inside and began fighting with the breeder as she tried to make her way to the basement to get another puppy, police said.<br />
<br />
The breeder wrestled the woman out of her house to the front porch, where the woman then hit the breeder over the head numerous times with the dead puppy, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported, citing police.<br />
<br />
As the woman drove away, she waved the dead puppy out of the car&#39;s sunroof and yelled threats at the breeder, police said. She later called the breeder and threatened her and her family, according to court records.<br />
<br />
Police said they are considering felony burglary charges and misdemeanor assault charges.</div></div><br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHA  I&#39;m still laughing.

				A woman in her forties went to a Plastic Surgeon for a face-lift. The Surgeon told her about a new procedure called &quot;The Knob,&quot; where a small knob is placed on the top of a woman&#39;s head and can be turned to tighten up her skin to produce the effect of a brand new face lift.<br />
<br />
Of course the woman wanted &quot;The Knob.&quot;<br />
<br />
Over the course of the years, the woman kept tightening the knob, and the effects were wonderful, and the woman remained young-looking and vibrant.<br />
<br />
        After fifteen years, the woman returned to the Surgeon with two problems.<br />
<br />
        &quot;All these years, everything has been working just fine.<br />
        I&#39;ve had to turn the knob many times and I&#39;ve always loved the results. But now I&#39;ve developed two annoying problems: First, I have these terrible Bags under my eyes and the knob won&#39;t get rid of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
        The doctor looked at her closely and said, &quot;Those aren&#39;t bags,<br />
        those are your Breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
        &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;I guess there&#39;s no point in asking about the Goatee.&quot;

				While she was enjoying herself at a lakeside picnic, a young lady was <br />
playing around on a bed of pine needles,<br />
when an extremely sharp one pierced her swimsuit, and embedded itself in <br />
her pubic area. <br />
She was rushed to the hospital, where the emergency doctor told her that <br />
he could not extract the pine needle<br />
until he checked with the appropriate authorities. <br />
The girl now in considerable pain, cried and asked the doctor why he <br />
could not help her. <br />
The doctor apologized that it was all a matter of ecology, and that he <br />
would have to file an environmental impact statement before he could <br />
remove any sort of timber from a recreational area.

				Darwin Award Winners: <br />
<br />
1. When his 38-caliber revolver failed to fire at his intended victim <br />
during a hold-up in Long Beach, California, would be robber James Elliot <br />
did something that can only inspire wonder. He peered down the barrel <br />
and tried the trigger again. This time it worked. <br />
<br />
And now, the honorable mentions: <br />
<br />
2. The chef at a hotel in Switzerland lost a finger in a meat cutting <br />
machine and, after a little hopping around, submitted a claim to his <br />
insurance company. The company expecting negligence sent out one of its <br />
men to have a look for himself. He tried the machine and lost a finger. <br />
The chef’s claim was approved. <br />
<br />
3. A man who shoveled snow for an hour to clear a space for his car <br />
during a blizzard in Chicago returned with his vehicle to find a woman <br />
had taken the space. Understandably, he shot her. <br />
<br />
4. After stopping for drinks at an illegal bar, a Zimbabwean bus driver <br />
found that the 20 mental patients he was supposed to be transporting <br />
from Harare to Bulawayo had escaped. Not wanting to admit his <br />
incompetence, the driver went to a nearby bus stop and offered everyone <br />
waiting there a free ride. He then delivered the passengers to the <br />
mental hospital, telling the staff that the patients were very excitable <br />
and prone to bizarre fantasies. <br />
The deception wasn’t discovered for three days. <br />
<br />
5. An American teenager was in the hospital recovering from serious head <br />
wounds received from an oncoming train. When asked how he received the <br />
injuries, the lad told police that he was simply trying to see how close <br />
he could get his head to a moving train before he was hit. <br />
<br />
6. A man walked into a Louisiana Circle-K, put a &#036;20 bill on the <br />
counter, and asked for change. When the clerk opened the cash drawer, <br />
the man pulled a gun and asked for all the cash in the register, which <br />
the clerk promptly provided. The man took the cash from the clerk and <br />
fled, leaving the &#036;20 bill on the counter. The total amount of cash he <br />
got from the drawer…&#036;15. (If someone points a gun at you and gives you <br />
money, is a crime committed?) <br />
<br />
7. Seems an Arkansas guy wanted some beer pretty badly. He decided that <br />
he’d just throw a cinderblock through a liquor store window, grab some <br />
booze, and run. So he lifted the cinderblock and heaved it over his head <br />
at the wind&#111;w. The cinderblock bounced back and hit the would-be thief <br />
on the head, knocking him unconscious. The liquor store window was made <br />
of <br />
Plexiglas. The whole event was caught on videotape. <br />
<br />
8. As a female shopper exited a New York convenience store, a man <br />
grabbed her purse and ran. The clerk called 911 immediately, and the <br />
woman was able to give them a detailed description of the snatcher. <br />
Within minutes, the police apprehended the snatcher. They put him in the <br />
car and drove back to the store. The thief was then taken out of the car <br />
and told to stand there for a positive ID. To which he replied, “Yes, <br />
officer, that’s her. That’s the lady I stole the purse from.” <br />
<br />
9. The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a <br />
Burger King in Ypsilanti, Michigan, at 5 a.m., flashed a gun, and <br />
demanded cash. The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn’t <br />
open the cash register without a food order. When the man ordered onion <br />
rings, the clerk said they weren’t available for breakfast. The man, <br />
frustrated, walked away. <br />
<br />
A 5-STAR STUPIDITY AWARD WINNER&#33; <br />
<br />
10. When a man attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on <br />
a Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for. Police arrived <br />
at the scene to find a very sick man curled up next to a motor home near <br />
spilled sewage. A police spokesman said that the man admitted to trying <br />
to steal gasoline and plugged his siphon hose into the motor home’s <br />
sewage tank by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to press <br />
charges, saying that it was the best laugh he’d had in years.

				SAD NEWS<br />
<br />
Please join me in remembering a great icon of the entertainment community. The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection and trauma complications from repeated pokes in the belly. He was 71.<br />
<br />
Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch. The grave site was piled high with flours.<br />
<br />
Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Doughboy rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times he still was a crusty old man and was considered a positive roll model for millions.<br />
<br />
Doughboy is survived by his wife Play Dough, two children, John Dough and Jane Dough, plus they had one in the oven. He is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart. The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
If this made you smile for even a brief second, please rise to the occasion and take time to pass it on and share that smile with someone else who may be having a crumby day and kneads it.

				These two guys are in a bar at the top of the Empire State building. The first guy says to the second guy, &quot;you know, the gravity here is weird, you can jump out of the window and when you fall, right around the 20th floor, you automatically come shooting back up.&quot; <br />
<br />
The second guy says, &quot;bullshit.&quot; So the first guy says, &quot;ok, i&#39;ll prove it.&quot; The first guy runs and jumps out the window, and sure enough around the 20th floor comes right back up in the wind&#111;w. <br />
<br />
The second guy says, &quot;holy shit, do it again.&quot; So he does. The first guy says, &quot;you try.&quot; The second guy runs, jumps out the window, and begins to fall, 40th floor, 30, 20, 10, 5...SPLAT&#33;, hits the pavement. <br />

The first guy sits back down and orders a drink and the bartender says, &quot;You know Superman, you can be a real dick sometimes.

				A Russian and a redneck wrestler were set to square off for the Olympic gold medal.<br />
<br />
Before the final match, the redneck wrestler&#39;s trainer came to him and said, &quot;Now, don&#39;t forget all the research we&#39;ve done on this Russian. <br />
<br />
He&#39;s never lost a match because of this &#39;pretzel&#39; hold he has.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do, do not let him get you in that hold&#33; If he does,<br />
<br />
You&#39;re finished&quot;;<br />
<br />
The redneck nodded in acknowledgment.<br />
<br />
As the match started, the redneck and the Russian circled each other several times, looking for an opening. All of a sudden, the Russian lunged forward, grabbing the redneck and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold.<br />
<br />
A sigh of disappointment arose from the crowd and the trainer buried his face in his hands, for he knew all was lost. He couldn&#39;t watch the inevitable happen.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, there was a scream; then a cheer from the crowd and the trainer raised his eyes just in time to watch the Russian go flying up in the air.<br />
<br />
His back hit the mat with a thud and the redneck collapsed on top of him making the pin and winning the match. The trainer was astounded. <br />
<br />
When he finally got his wrestler alone he asked &quot;how did you ever get out of that hold? No one has ever done it before&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
The wrestler answered &quot;well, I was ready to give up when he got me in that hold but at the last moment, I opened my eyes and saw this pair of testicles right in front of my face. I had nothing to lose, so with my last ounce of strength, I stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the trainer exclaimed &quot;that&#39;s what finished him off&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. You&#39;d be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own nuts.&quot;

				Here&#39;s the skinny on Aussie bush etiquette. KiraSjon may need this stuff&#33;<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>General Stuff</strong><br />
1. Never take an open stubby to a job interview.<br />
2. Always identify people in your paddocks before shooting at them.<br />
3. It&#39;s tacky to take an Esky to church.<br />
4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it&#39;s time to change the sheets.<br />
5. Even if you&#39;re certain you&#39;re included in the will, it&#39;s rude to take your ute and trailer to the funeral.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<strong class='bbc'>DINING OUT.</strong><br />
1. When decanting wine from the box, tilt the paper cup and pour slowly so as not to bruise the wine.<br />
2. If drinking directly from the bottle, hold it with only one hand.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<strong class='bbc'>ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME</strong> <br />
 1. A centrepiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist.<br />
2. Don&#39;t allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how good his manners. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>PERSONAL HYGIENE</strong> <br />
1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this should be done in private, using one&#39;s OWN ute keys.<br />
2. Even if you live alone, deodorant isn&#39;t a waste of money.<br />
3. Extensive use of deodorant can only delay bathing by a few days.<br />
4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a no-no, it alters the taste of finger foods and if you are a woman it can draw attention away from your jewellery.  <br />
<br />
 <strong class='bbc'>DATING</strong> <br />
1. Always offer to bait your date&#39;s hook - especially on the first date.<br />
2. Be assertive. Let her know you&#39;re interested: &quot;I&#39;ve been wanting to go out with you ever since I read that stuff about you on the dunny door two years ago.&quot;<br />
3. Establish with her parents what time she&#39;s expected back. Some will say 11:00 PM, others might say &quot;Monday.&quot; If the latter is the answer, it&#39;s the man&#39;s responsibility to get her to school on time.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<strong class='bbc'>THEATRE/CINEMA ETIQUETTE</strong> <br />
 1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up after the movie ends.<br />
2. Refrain from yelling abuse at characters on the screen. Tests have proven they can&#39;t hear you. <br />
<br />
 <strong class='bbc'> WEDDINGS</strong><br />
 1. Livestock is a poor choice for a wedding gift.<br />
2. Kissing the bride for more than five seconds may cause a drop in your popularity. (Excessive use of the tongue is also considered out of place)<br />
3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A tracksuit with a cumber- bund and a clean football jumper can create a tacky appearance. <br />
4. Though uncomfortable, say &quot;yes&quot; to socks and shoes for the occasion. <br />
<br />
 <strong class='bbc'>DRIVING ETIQUETTE</strong><br />
 1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if your gun&#39;s loaded and the roo&#39;s in your rifle sight.<br />
2. When entering a roundabout, the vehicle with the largest roo bar doesn&#39;t always have the right of way.<br />
3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.<br />
4. When sending your wife down the road with a petrol can, it&#39;s impolite to ask her to bring back beer too.

				Got this in an email today.<br />
<br />
Saint Bush<br />
<br />
President George W. Bush was scheduled to visit the Episcopal Church outside Washington as part of his campaign to restore his poll standings.<br />
<br />
Bush&#39;s campaign manager made a visit to the Bishop, and said to him<br />
 &quot;We&#39;ve been getting a lot of bad publicity because of the president&#39;s position on stem cell research, the Iraq war, Katrina, and the like.  We&#39;d gladly make a contribution to the church of &#036;100,000 if during your sermon you&#39;d say the President is a saint.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Bishop thought it over for a few moments and finally said, &quot;The Church is in desperate need of funds and I will agree to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bush showed up for the sermon and the Bishop began:  &quot;I&#39;d like to speak to you all this morning about our President.  George Bush is a liar, a cheat, and a low-intelligence weasel. He took<br />
the tragedy of September 11 and used it to frighten and manipulate the American people. He lied about weapons of mass destruction and invaded Iraq for oil and money, causing the deaths of tens of thousands and making the United States the most hated country on earth.<br />
<br />
He appointed cronies to positions of power and influence, leading to widespread death and destruction during Hurricane Katrina. He awarded contracts and tax cuts to his rich friends so that we now have more poverty in this country, and a greater gap between rich and poor, than we&#39;ve had since the Depression. He instituted illegal wiretaps when getting a warrant from a secret court would have been a mere administrative detail, had his henchmen lie to Congress about it, then claimed he is above the law.<br />
<br />
He has headed the most corrupt, bribe-inducing political party since Teapot Dome. The national surplus has turned into a staggering national debt of 7.6 Trillion, gas prices are up 85%, and vital research into global warming and stem cells is stopped cold because he&#39;s afraid to lose votes from some religious kooks.<br />
<br />
He is the worst example of a true Christian I&#39;ve ever known. But compared to Dick Cheney and Karl Rove, George Bush is a saint.&quot;

				When girls drink too much............<br />
 1. We have absolutely no idea where our purse is.<br />
<br />
 2. We believe that dancing with our arms overhead and wiggling our<br />
  butt while yelling &quot;woo-hoo&#33;&quot; is truly the sexiest dance move<br />
  around.<br />
<br />
 3. We&#39;ve suddenly decided that we want to kick someone&#39;s ass and<br />
  honestly believe we could do it too.<br />
<br />
 4. In our last trip to pee, we realize that we now look more like a<br />
  homeless hooker than the goddess we were just four hours ago<br />
<br />
 5. We start crying and telling everyone we see that we love them<br />
  sooooo much.<br />
<br />
 6. We get extremely excited and jump up and down every time a new<br />
  song play&#39;s because &quot;oh my god&#33; I love this song&#33;&quot;<br />
<br />
 7. We&#39;ve found a deeper/spiritual side to the geek sitting next to us<br />
<br />
 8. We&#39;ve suddenly taken up smoking and become really good at it.<br />
<br />
 9. We yell at the bartender, who we believe cheated us by giving us<br />
  just lemonade, but that&#39;s just because we can no longer taste the gin<br />
<br />
 10. We think we are in bed, but our pillow feels strangely like the<br />
  kitchen floor (or the mop?)<br />
<br />
 11. We fail to notice that the toilet lid&#39;s down when we sit on it.<br />
<br />
 12. We take our shoes off because we believe it&#39;s their fault that<br />
   we&#39;re having problems walking straight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Postscript: Of course, none of this applies to any ladies who frequent CC.Net&#33; We might lose track of the coveted Pink Feathered Thong, but that&#39;s about it&#33;  ;D

				I got this from my daughter today.  Don&#39;t know how true it is, but I&#39;m gonna try the recipe.<br />
<br />
<p class='citation'>Quote</p><div class="blockquote"><div class='quote'>I love it when the little guy strikes back&#33;<br />
<br />
A little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you don&#39;t know already, is a very expensive store; i.e., they sell your typical &#036;8.00 T-shirt for &#036;50.00.<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s let them have it&#33; THIS IS A TRUE STORY&#33;<br />
<br />
My daughter and I had just finished a salad at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas, and we decided to have a small dessert.  Because both of us are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the&quot;Neiman-Marcus cookie.&quot; It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe, and the waitress said with a small frown, &quot;I&#39;m afraid not, but you can buy the recipe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, I asked how much, and she responded, &quot;Only two fifty-it&#39;s a great deal&#33;&quot; I agreed to that, and told her to just add it to my tab. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement, and the Neiman-Marcus charge was &#036;285.00&#33; I looked agai n, and I remembered I had only spent &#036;9.95 for two salads and about &#036;20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;Cookie Recipe-&#036;250.00&quot;.<br />
<br />
That was outrageous&#33;<br />
<br />
I called Neiman&#39;s Accounting Department and told them the waitress said it was &quot;two fifty&quot;, which clearly does not mean &quot;two hundred and fifty dollars&quot; by any reasonable interpretation of the phrase.  Neiman-Marcus refused to budge.  They would not refund my money because, according to them, &quot;What the waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the recipe.  We absolutely will not refund your money at this point.&quot; I explained to the Accounting Department lady the criminal statutes which govern fraud in the state of Texas. I threatened to report them to the Better Business Bureau and the Texas Attorney General&#39;s office for engaging in fraud.<br />
<br />
I was basically told, &quot;Do what you want. Don&#39;t bother thinking of how you can get ev en, and don&#39;t bother trying to get any of your money back.&quot; I just said, &quot;Okay, you folks got my &#036;250, and now I&#39;m going to have &#036;250 worth of fun.&quot; I told her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover in the United States with an e-mail account has a &#036;250 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus...for free.<br />
<br />
She replied, &quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t do this.&quot;  I said, &quot;Well, perhaps you should have thought of that before you ripped me off&#33;&quot; and slammed down the phone. So here it is&#33;<br />
<br />
Please, please, please pass it on to everyone you can possibly think of.  I paid &#036;250 for this, and I don&#39;t want Neiman-Marcus to EVER make another penny off of this recipe&#33;<br />
<br />
<strong class='bbc'>NEIMAN-MARCUS COOKIES (Recipe may be halved)<br />
<br />
2 cups butter<br />
24 oz. chocolate chips<br />
4 cups flour<br />
2 cups brown sugar<br />
2 tsp. soda<br />
1 tsp. salt<br />
2 cups sugar<br />
1.8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)<br />
5 cups blended oatmeal<br />
4 eggs<br />
2 tsp. baking powder<br />
2 tsp. vanilla<br />
3 cu ps chopped nuts (your choice)<br />
<br />
Measure oatmeal, and blend in a blender to a fine powder. Cream the butter and both sugars. Add eggs and vanilla, mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar, and nuts. Roll into balls, and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet.<br />
<br />
Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees. Makes 112 cookies.</strong><br />
<br />
PLEASE READ THE RECIPE AND SEND IT TO EVERY PERSON YOU KNOW WHO HAS AN E-MAIL ADDRESS&#33; THIS IS REALLY TERRIFIC&#33;&#33;<br />
<br />
Even if the people on your e-mail list don&#39;t eat sweets send it to them and ask them to pass it on. Let&#39;s make sure we get these ladies &#036;250.00 worth. Enjoy the cookies, they are good....</div></div><br />
<br />
Enjoy some NM cookies.

  <!--fonto:--><span style="font-family:"><!--/fonto--><span style='font-size: 13px;'> My daughter &amp; I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas &amp; decided to have a small dessert. Because our family are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the &quot;Neiman-Marcus Cookie&quot;. It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they said with a small frown, &quot;I&#39;m afraid not.&quot; Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I asked how much, and she responded, &quot;Two fifty.&quot; I said with approval, just add it to my tab. <br />
<br />
 Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was &#036;285.00. I looked again and I remembered I had only spent &#036;9.95 for two salads and about &#036;20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;Cookie Recipe - &#036;250.00.&quot; Boy, was I upset&#33;&#33; I called Neiman&#39;s Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it was &quot;two fifty,&quot; and I did not realize she meant &#036;250.00 for a cookie recipe. I asked them to take back the recipe and reduce my bill and they said they were sorry, but because all the recipes were this expensive so not just everyone could duplicate any of our bakery recipes....the bill would stand. I waited, thinking of how I could get even or even try and get any of my money back. <br />
<br />
 I just said, &quot;Okay, you folks got my &#036;250.00 and now I&#39;m going to have &#036;250.00 worth of fun.&quot; I told her that I was going to see to it that every cookie lover will have a &#036;250.00 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus for nothing. She replied, &quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t do this.&quot; I said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry but this is the only way I feel I could get even,&quot; and I will. <br />
<br />
 So, here it is, and please pass it to someone else or run a few copies....I paid for it; now you can have it for free. (Recipe may be halved): <br />
<br />
 2 cups butter <br />
 4 cups flour  <br />
 2 tsp. soda   <br />
 2 cups sugar  <br />
 5 cups blended oatmeal**  <br />
 24 oz. chocolate chips  <br />
 2 cups brown sugar  <br />
 1 tsp. salt  <br />
 1 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated)  <br />
 4 eggs  <br />
 2 tsp. baking powder   <br />
 3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)  <br />
 2 tsp. vanilla  <br />
 <br />
 Cream the butter and both sugars. Add eggs and vanilla; mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts. Roll into balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees. Makes 112 cookies. <br />
 <br />
 ** measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.   </span></span>  <br />
 <span style='font-family: Arial'><span style='color: #008800'><strong class='bbc'>Origins:</strong></span></span>   What                  we have here is a golden oldie of an urban legend, one second in tenacity only to Craig Shergold&#39;s request for business cards. It&#39;s the ultimate &quot;strike a blow for the little guy,&quot; and in that lies its appeal. That by forwarding it on, <em class='bbc'>we</em> can be armchair heroes. <br />
<br />
 Though its present incarnation casts Neiman-Marcus as the bad guy, this legend has been around for at least 50 years, and it&#39;s been told of various companies (and various confections) during its long history. Here&#39;s a fine example from a 1948 cookbook, <em class='bbc'>Massachusetts Cooking Rules, Old and New,</em> which lists not only the recipe for &quot;&#036;25 Fudge Cake&quot; but also gives the following explanation for the name:  <br />
 </span>[/font]<div class='bbc_indent'><span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'>  This friend had to pay &#036;25 upon the receipt of the recipe from the chef of one of the railroads. She had asked for the recipe while eating on a train. The chef gladly sent it to her, together with a bill for &#036;25, which her attorney said she had to pay. She then gave the recipe to all her friends, hoping they would get some pleasure from it.  </span></span></span></span></div><span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'>   Sound disturbingly familiar? <br />
<br />
 The   <img src='http://www.snopes.com/business/graphics/cookie.jpg' alt='Posted Image' class='bbc_img' /> 1960s saw this tale mutate into a villainization of New York&#39;s famed Waldorf-Astoria hotel over a dessert known as &quot;Red Velvet Cake.&quot; A woman who&#39;d dined at the hotel later wrote to ask for the recipe. The recipe arrived . . . along with a bill for &#036;350, a bill her lawyer assured her she had to pay. Her way of getting even was -- you guessed it -- to distribute the recipe far and wide. <br />
<br />
 (&#036;350 is a <em class='bbc'>shocking</em> figure for those times. Just to give an idea of the relative worth of things back then, the grocery budget at my house was &#036;50 a week for a family of four. Faced with a &#036;35 dentist bill, my mother would for the next two weeks stand over me as I brushed my teeth at bedtime, making sure I wasn&#39;t half doing the job and thus sentencing the family to the poor house.) <br />
<br />
 By the late 1970s, this legend had shifted to Mrs. Fields and chocolate chip cookies. Indeed, this version proved so fiendishly popular that in 1987 the following notice signed by Debbi Fields was displayed in her stores: </span></span><div class='bbc_indent'><span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'><span style='color: #000000'>  Mrs. Fields recipe has <span class='bbc_underline'>never</span> been sold. There is a rumor circulating that the Mrs. Fields Cookie recipe was sold to a woman at a cost of &#036;250. A chocolate-chip cookie recipe was attached to the story. I would like to tell all my customers that this story is <span class='bbc_underline'>not true,</span> this is not my recipe and I have not sold the recipe to anyone. Mrs. Fields recipe is a delicious trade secret.  </span></span></span></span></span></div><span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'>   You rarely hear this tale told of Mrs. Fields these days -- the 1990s saw it shift yet again, this time to point a finger at Neiman-Marcus. One possible reason for this shift could have been a double misremembering of names as the legend was briefly told of the department store Marshall Fields: Mrs. Fields to Marshall Fields (similar name) and Marshall Fields to Neiman-Marcus (similar-sounding name plus both are department stores). <br />
<br />
 As the latest in a long line of victims, Neiman-Marcus has fielded numerous inquiries about the following tale (which I&#39;ve excerpted from the rather lengthy canonical version): <br />
 </span></span><div class='bbc_indent'><span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><span style='font-family: Verdana'><span style='font-size: 13px;'><span style='color: #000000'> My daughter &amp; I had just finished a salad at Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas &amp; decided to have a small dessert. Because our family are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the &quot;Neiman-Marcus Cookie&quot;. It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and they said with a small frown, &quot;I&#39;m afraid not.&quot; Well, I said, would you let me buy the recipe? With a cute smile, she said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I asked how much, and she responded, &quot;Two fifty.&quot; I said with approval, just add it to my tab. <br />
<br />
Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement from Neiman-Marcus and it was &#036;285.00. I looked again and I remembered I had only spent &#036;9.95 for two salads and about &#036;20.00 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, &quot;Cookie Recipe - &#036;250.00.&quot; Boy, was I upset&#33;&#33; I called Neiman&#39;s Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it was &quot;two fifty,&quot; and I did not realize she meant &#036;250.00 for a cookie recipe.  </span></span></span></span></span></div><span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'> (Neiman-Marcus refuses to strike down the bill; then comes the usual exhortation from the writer to pass this along to as many as possible.) <br />
<br />
 Especially in their particular case, the legend is even more improbable than usual in that:  </span></span><ul class='bbc'><span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><br /></li><li> Until quite recently there was no such thing as a &quot;Neiman-Marcus&quot; cookie. They developed a chocolate chip cookie in response to the rumor. </span></span><span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><br /></li><li> There is no &quot;Neiman Marcus Cafe&quot; at any of the chain&#39;s three Dallas-area stores. Instead, the restaurants are named Zodiac, Zodiac at North Park, and The Woods. </span></span><span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'><br /></li><li>  Neiman Marcus does not sell recipes from its restaurants. The department store gives them away for free to anyone who asks. </span></span></li></ul>  <span style='font-family: Trebuchet'><span style='font-size: 15px;'>(Check out the <a href='http://www.neimanmarcus.com/store/service/nm_cookie_recipe.jhtml' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>Neiman Marcus</a> web page for a bit about this piece of lore and their newly-developed chocolate chip cookie recipe.) <br />
<br />
 As to why this legend has taken on a life of its own despite persistent and detailed debunkings, it&#39;s a classic David and Goliath story. It is, after all, the little guy smacking the big, heartless corporation a swift one right across the nose, something both you and I have often longed to do. This bit of faxlore invites -- nay, <em class='bbc'>demands</em> -- participation. Painless participation too. One tap of the &quot;Forward&quot; key and someone who always saw herself as part of The Forces For Good (but who could never find the time to change the world) gets to enjoy that wonderfully warming self-righteous feeling that comes from Striking A Blow. All it takes is either a couple of pins and a bulletin board or e-mail capability and an alias list and your good deed of the day is done and finished before the morning&#39;s first coffee has cooled. <br />
<br />
 What&#39;s the possible slandering of an innocent company when there&#39;s a cheap &#39;n&#39; easy &quot;warm fuzzy feeling&quot; to be had? Like, would an anonymous, forwarded-a-million-times e-mail lie to you? <br />

				I am passing this on to you because it definitely worked for <br />
me and we all could use more calmness in our lives. By <br />
following the simple advice I heard on a Dr. Phil show, I have <br />
finally found inner peace. Dr. Phil proclaimed the way to <br />
achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you have<br />
started. So I looked around my house to see things I started <br />
and hadn&#8217;t finished; and, before leaving the house this morning <br />
I finished off a bottle of Merlot, a bottle of White Zinfandel, <br />
a bottle of Glenlivet, a bottle of Kahlua, a package of Oreos, the<br />
remainder of both Prozac and Valium, the rest of the Cheesecake, <br />
some Saltines and box of Chocolates.<br />
<br />
You have no idea how fucking good I feel.

				Another email.<br /><br />Two couples were playing poker one evening. John accidentally dropped some cards on the floor. When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed Bill&#39;s wife, Sue, wasn&#39;t wearing any underwear under her dress&#33; <br /><br />Shocked by this, John upon trying to sit back up again, hit  his head on the table and emerged red-faced. <br /><br />Later, John went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Bill&#39;s wife followed and asked, &quot;Did you see anything that you liked  under there?&quot; <br /><br />Surprised by her  boldness, John courageously admitted that, well indeed he did. <br /><br />She said, &quot; Well, you can have it but it will cost you &#036;500.&quot; <br /> <br />After  taking a minute or two to assess the financial and moral costs of this offer, John confirms that he is interested. She tells him that since her husband Bill works Friday afternoons and as John doesn&#39;t, he should be at  her house around 2 p.m. Friday afternoon. <br /><br />When Friday rolled  around, John showed up at Bill&#39;s house at  2  p.m. sharp and after paying Sue the agreed sum of &#036;500 they went to  the bedroom and closed their transaction, as agreed. <br /><br />John then  quickly dressed and left. <br /><br />As usual, Bill came home from work at 6  p.m. and upon entering the  house,asked his wife abruptly. &quot;Did John come by the house this afternoon?&quot; <br /> <br />With a lump in her throat Sue  answered &quot;Why yes, he did stop by for a  few minutes this afternoon.&quot; <br /><br />Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband curtly asked, &quot;And did he give you &#036;500?&quot; <br /><br />In terror she assumed that  somehow he had found out and after mustering her best poker face, replied,  &quot;Well, yes, in fact he did give me &#036;500&quot;. <br /><br />Bill, with a satisfied  look on his face, surprised his wife by saying, &quot;Good, I was hoping he  did. John came by the office this morning and borrowed &#036;500 from me. He  promised me he&#39;d stop by our house this afternoon on his way home and pay me back....

				Got this in an email from my sister...<br /><br />Remember I had a yellow lab named Lucy, and I was buying a large bag  of<br />Purina at the supermarket and was in line to check out.<br /><br />A woman  behind me asked if I had a dog.<br /><br />On impulse, I told her that no, I was  starting The Purina Diet again,<br />although I probably shouldn&#39;t because I&#39;d  ended up in the hospital last<br />time, but that I&#39;d lost 50 pounds before I  awakened in an intensive care<br />ward with tubes coming out of most of my  orifices and IVs in both arms.<br /><br />I told her that it was essentially a  perfect diet and that the way that<br />it works is to load your pants pockets  with Purina nuggets and simply<br />eat one or two every time you feel hungry  &amp; that the food is<br />nutritionally complete so I was going to try it  again.<br /><br />I have to mention here that practically everyone in the checkout  line<br />was by now enthralled with my story, particularly a guy who was  behind<br />her.<br /><br />Horrified, she asked if I&#39;d ended up in the hospital in  that condition<br />because I had been poisoned.<br /><br />I told her no; it was  because I&#39;d been sitting in the street licking my<br />testicles and a car hit  me.<br /><br />I thought one guy was going to have a heart attack as he staggered  out<br />the door laughing loudly&#33;

				Another email...    <br /><br />Animals don&#39;t stutter<br /><br /><br />    A teacher is explaining biology to her 4th  grade students. &quot;Human<br />beings are the only animals that stutter&quot;, she  says.<br /><br />  A little girl raises her hand. &quot;I had a kitty-cat who stuttered&quot;,  she<br />volunteered.<br /><br />  The teacher, knowing how precious some of these  stories could become,<br />asked the girl to describe the incident.<br /><br />   &quot;Well&quot;, she began, &quot;I was in the back yard with my kitty and the<br />Rottweiler  who lives next door got a running start and before we knew it,<br />he jumped over  the fence into our yard&#33;&quot;<br /><br />  &quot;That must&#39;ve been scary&quot;, said the  teacher.<br /><br />  &quot;It sure was&quot;, said the little girl. &quot;My kitty went &#39;Fffff,  Fffff,<br />Fffff&#39;... and before he could say &quot;Fuck,&quot; the Rottweiler ate him&#33;&quot;<br /><br /><br />Once upon a time there lived a king. <br />The king had a beautiful daughter, the   PRINCESS. <br /><br />But there was a problem. <br /><br />Everything the princess   touched would melt. <br /><br />No matter what; <br /><br />metal, wood, stone,   <br /><br />anything she touched would melt. <br /><br />Because of this, men were   afraid of her. Nobody would dare marry <br />her. The king despaired. What   could he do to help his daughter? <br /><br />He consulted his wizards and   magicians. One wizard told the king, <br />&quot;If your daughter touches one thing   that does not melt in her hands, she <br />will be cured.&quot; <br /><br />The king was overjoyed and came up with a plan. <br /><br /><br /><br />The next day, he held a   competition. Any man that could bring his <br />daughter an object that would not   melt would marry her and inherit the <br />king&#39;s wealth. <br /><br />THREE YOUNG   PRINCES TOOK UP THE CHALLENGE. <br /><br />The first brought a sword of the finest   steel.<br />But alas, when the princess touched it, it melted.   <br /><br />The prince went away sadly. <br /><br /><br />The second prince brought   diamonds.<br />He thought diamonds are the hardest substance in the   world and would <br />not melt. <br /><br />But alas, once the princess touched them, they   melted. He too was <br />sent away disappointed. <br /><br /><br />The third prince   approached. <br /><br />He told the princess, &quot;Put your hand in my pocket and feel   what is in <br />there.&quot; The princess did as she was told, though she turned   red. <br /><br /><br /><br />She felt something hard. She held it in her hand.   <br /><br />And it did not melt&#33;&#33;&#33; <br /><br />The king was overjoyed&#33;&#33; Everybody in   the kingdom was overjoyed. <br /><br />And the third prince married the princess and   they both lived happily <br />ever after. <br /><br /><br /><br />Question: What was in   the prince&#39;s pants? <br /><br /><br />v <br /><br />v   <br /><br />V<br />V<br />V<br />V<br /><br /><br /><br />M&amp;M&#39;s of course. <br /><br />They melt   in your mouth, not in your hand. <br /><br />What were you thinking??

				Got a batch of these today....<br /><br />THINGS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE TO BE A  REPUBLICAN TODAY...  <br /><br />Jesus loves you, and shares your  hatred of homosexuals and Hillary.   <br /><br />Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when  Bush&#39;s <br />daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, <br />and a bad guy when Bush needed a &quot;we can&#39;t find  Bin Laden&quot; diversion.  <br /><br />Trade with Cuba is wrong because the  country is Communist,  but trade <br />with China and Vietnam is  vital to a spirit of international harmony.  <br /><br />The United  States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest <br />national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.  <br /><br />A  woman can&#39;t be trusted with decisions about her own body, but  multi-  <br />national corporations can make  decisions affecting all mankind  without <br />regulation.   <br /><br />The  best way to improve military morale  is to praise the troops in  <br />speeches, while slashing veterans&#39;   benefits and combat pay.  <br /><br />If condoms are kept out of schools,  adolescents won&#39;t have sex.   <br /><br />A  good way to fight terrorism is  to belittle our long-time allies,  then <br />demand their  cooperation and money.  <br /><br />Providing health care to all Iraqis is  sound policy, but providing <br />health care to all Americans is socialism. HMOs and insurance <br />companies have the best interests  of  the public at heart.  <br /><br />Global warming and tobacco&#39;s link to cancer are junk science, but <br />creationism should be taught in schools.  <br /><br />A  president lying about an extra-marital affair is an impeachable  <br />offense, but a president lying to enlist  support for a war in which <br />thousands die is solid defense  policy.  <br /><br />Government should limit itself to the powers named in  the Constitution, <br />which include banning gay marriages and  censoring the Internet.  <br /><br />The public has a right to know about  Hillary&#39;s cattle trades, but  <br />George Bush&#39;s driving record is  none of our business.  <br /><br />Being a drug addict is a moral failing  and a crime, unless you&#39;re a <br />Conservative radio host. Then  it&#39;s an illness and you need our prayers <br />for your  recovery.   <br /><br />What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national  interest, but <br />what Bush did in the  &#39;80s is irrelevant.  <br /><br />If   you don&#39;t send it to at least 10 other people, we&#39;re likely to be   <br />stuck with more Republicans in &#39;06  and &#39;08.  <br /><br />FRIENDS DON&#39;T  LET FRIENDS VOTE  REPUBLICAN

				I hadn&#39;t heard anything about Prince Charles having some homosexual trist, and I could care less about his sexuality.  But the Jon Stewart/Stephen Colbert take on it is just too freakin&#39; hilarious.  Why the hell can&#39;t the British press publish stories on this shit?  The hell happened to free press there?  Why didn&#39;t this make the US news?  Ya got to watch this video if you want a great laugh.  Too goddamned funny.  Don&#39;t be expecting a phone call when you watch this, you won&#39;t be able to speak for a few minutes.<br /><br /><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=0M6VTB0_5-8" target="_blank"><a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=0M6VTB0_5-8' class='bbc_url' title='External link' rel='nofollow external'>http://youtube.com/watch?v=0M6VTB0_5-8</a></a>

Come home, fix dinner, play with the kids. I then had the  thought that would ring painfully in my mind for the next few hours: &quot;Maybe I  should pull the waxing kit out of the medicine cabinet.&quot; So I headed to the site  of my demise: the bathroom. <br /><br />It was one of those &quot;cold wax&quot; kits. No  melting a clump of hot wax, you just rub the strips together in your hand, they  get warm and you peel them apart and press them to your leg (or wherever else)  and you pull the hair right off. No muss, no fuss. How hard can it be? I mean,  I&#39;m not a genius, <br />but I am mechanically inclined enough to figure this out.  <br />(YA THINK&#33;?&#33;)<br /><br />So I pull one of the thin strips out. It&#39;s two strips  facing each <br />other stuck together. Instead of rubbing them together, my  genius kicks in so I get out the hair dryer and heat it to 1000 degrees. (&quot;Cold  wax,&quot; yeah...right&#33;) I lay the strip across my thigh. Hold the skin around it  tight and pull. It works&#33; OK, so it wasn&#39;t the best feeling, but it wasn&#39;t too  bad. I can do this&#33; Hair removal no longer eludes me&#33; I am She-rah, fighter of  all wayward body hair and maker of smooth skin extraordinaire. <br /><br />With my  next wax strip I move north. After checking on the kids, I sneak back into the  bathroom, for the ultimate hair fighting championship. I drop my panties and  place one foot on the toilet. Using the same procedure, I apply the one strip  across the right side of my bikini line, covering the right half of my *hoo-hoo*  and stretching down to the inside of my butt cheek (Yes, it was a long strip) I  inhale deeply and brace myself....RRRRIIIPPP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; <br /><br />I&#39;m blind&#33;&#33;&#33; Blinded  from pain&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;....OH MY GOD&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Vision <br />returning, I notice that I&#39;ve  only managed to pull off half the <br />strip. OH NO&#33; What have I done???&#33;&#33;&#33;  Another deep breath and RRIIPP&#33;&#33; Everything is swirly and spotted. I think I  may pass out...must stay conscious...Do I hear crashing drums??? Breathe,  breathe...OK, back to normal. <br /><br />I want to see my trophy - a wax covered  strip, the one that has caused me so much pain, with my hairy pelt sticking to  it. I want to revel in the glory that is my triumph over body hair. I hold up  the strip&#33; There&#39;s no hair on it. Where is the hair??? WHERE IS THE WAX???  <br /><br />Slowly I ease my head down, foot still perched on the toilet. I see the  hair. The hair that should be on the strip. I touch. I am touching wax. WHAT?&#33; I  run my fingers over the most sensitive part of my body, which is now covered in  cold wax and matted hair. <br /><br />Then I make the next BIG mistake...remember my  foot is still propped up on the toilet? I know I need to do something. So I put  my foot down. My LIFE FLASHES BEFORE ME&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; I hear the slamming of a cell  door. *hoo-hoo*? Sealed <br />shut&#33; Butt?? Sealed shut&#33;<br /><br />I penguin walk  around the bathroom trying to figure out what to do and think to myself &quot;Please  don&#39;t let me get the urge to poop. My head may pop off&#33;&quot; <br />What can I do to  melt the wax? Hot water&#33;&#33; Hot water melts wax&#33;&#33;&#33; <br /><br />I&#39;ll run the hottest  water I can stand into the bathtub, get in, <br />immerse the wax-covered bits and  the wax should melt and I can gently wipe it off, right??? WRONG&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;<br /><br />I  get in the tub - the water is slightly hotter than that used to <br />torture  prisoners of war or sterilize surgical equipment - I sit.<br /><br />Now, the only  thing worse than having your nether regions glued together is having them glued  together and then glued to the bottom of the tub...in scalding hot water. Which,  by the way, doesn&#39;t melt cold wax. <br /><br />So, now I&#39;m stuck to the bottom of  the tub as though I had cement-epoxied myself to the porcelain&#33;&#33;<br /><br />God  bless the man who had convinced me a few months ago to have a phone put in the  bathroom&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;<br /><br />I call my friend, thinking surely she has waxed before and  has some secret of how to get me undone. It&#39;s a very good conversation starter -  &quot;So, my butt and who-ha are glued together to the bottom of the tub&#33;&quot;  <br /><br />There is a slight pause. She doesn&#39;t know any secret tricks for removal  but she does try to hide her laughter from me. She wants to know exactly where  the wax is located, &quot;Are we talking cheeks or hoo-ha?&quot; <br /><br />She&#39;s laughing  out loud by now...I can hear her. I give her the <br />rundown and she suggests I  call the number on the side of the box. YEAH&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Right&#33;&#33; I should be the joke  of someone else&#39;s night. <br /><br />While we go through various solutions. I resort  to scraping the wax off with a razor. Nothing feels better then to have your  girlie goodies covered in hot wax, glued shut, stuck to the tub in super hot  water and then dry-shaving the sticky wax off&#33;&#33; <br /><br />By now the brain is not  working, dignity has taken a major hike and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m going to need  Post-Traumatic Stress counseling for this event.<br /><br />My friend is still  talking with me when I finally see my saving <br />grace....the lotion they give  you to remove the excess wax. What do I really have to lose at this point? I rub  some on and OH MY GOD&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;<br /><br />The scream probably woke the kids and scared  the dickens out of my friend. <br /><br />It&#39;s sooo painful, but I really don&#39;t  care. &quot;IT WORKS&#33;&#33; It works&#33;&#33;&quot; I get a hearty congratulation from my friend and  she hangs up.<br /><br />I successfully remove the remainder of the wax and then  notice to my grief and despair....THE HAIR IS STILL THERE.......ALL OF  IT&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; <br /><br />So I recklessly shave it off. Heck, I&#39;m numb by now.  Nothing hurts. I could have amputated my own leg at this point.<br /><br />Next week  I&#39;m going to try hair color.....<br />Now that&#39;s funny . Notttttttttt Send this on  to other ladies <br />who need a good laugh&#33; <br /><br />When I stand before God at  the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent  left and I could say, &quot;I used everything that you gave me&quot;~Erma Bombeck  <!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc--><!--sizec--></span><!--/sizec--><!--fontc--></span><!--/fontc--><!--fonto:Tahoma--><span style="font-family:Tahoma"><!--/fonto--><!--sizeo:10--><span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:100%"><!--/sizeo--><!--coloro:black--><span style="color:black"><!--/coloro--><br /><!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc--><!--sizec--></span><!--/sizec--><!--fontc--></span><!--/fontc--><!--QuoteEnd--></div><!--QuoteEEnd-->

				One of my wife&#39;s all-time favorites:<br /><br />A medical school professor was giving a lecture on &quot;Involuntary Muscular Contractions&quot; to his first year anatomy class.<br /><br />Realizing that this was not the most riveting of subject, the professor decided to lighten the mood a bit. He pointed to a gorgeous  redhead in the front row and said, &quot;Miss Williams, Do you know what your asshole is doing while you&#39;re having an orgasm?&quot;<br /><br />She quickly replied, &quot;Most likely, he&#39;s off somewhere deer hunting with his buddies.&quot;

				New Rule: Stop saying that teenage boys who have sex with their hot, blonde teachers are permanently damaged. I have a better description for these kids: lucky bastards.<br /><br />New Rule: Stop giving me that pop-up ad for classmates.Com&#33; There&#39;s a reason you don&#39;t talk to people for 25 years. Because you don&#39;t particularly like them&#33; Besides, I already know what the captain of the football team is doing these days: mowing my lawn.<br /><br />New Rule: Don&#39;t eat anything that&#39;s served to you out a window unless you&#39;re a seagull. People are acting all shocked that a human finger was found in a bowl of Wendy&#39;s chili. Hey, it cost less than a dollar. What did you expect it to contain? Trout?<br /><br />New Rule: If you need to shave and you still collect baseball cards, you&#39;re a dope. If you&#39;re a kid, the cards are keepsakes of your idols. <br />If you&#39;re a grown man, they&#39;re pictures of men.<br /><br />New Rule: Ladies , leave your eyebrows alone. Here&#39;s how much men care about your eyebrows: do you have two of them? Okay, we&#39;re done. <br /><br />New Rule: There&#39;s no such thing as flavored water. There&#39;s a whole aisle of this crap at the supermarket, water, but without that watery taste.  <br />Sorry, but flavored water is called a soft drink. You want flavored water? Pour some scotch over ice and let it melt. That&#39;s your flavored water.<br /><br />New Rule: Stop screwing with old people. Target is introducing a redesigned pill bottle that&#39;s square, with a bigger label. And the top is now the bottom. And by the time grandpa figures out how to open it, his ass will be in the morgue. Congratulations, Target, you just solved the Social Security crisis.<br /><br />New Rule: The more complicated the Starbucks order, the bigger the jerk. <br /><br />If you walk into a Starbucks and order a &quot;decaf Grande half-soy, half-low fat, iced vanilla, double-shot, gingerbread cappuccino, extra dry, light ice, with one Sweet-n&#39;-Low and one Nutra Sweet,&quot; ooh, you&#39;re a huge jerk. <br /><br />New Rule: I&#39;m not the cashier&#33; By the time I look up from sliding my card, entering my PIN number, pressing &quot;Enter,&quot; verifying the amount, deciding, no I don&#39;t want cash back, and pressing &quot;Enter&quot; again, the kid who is supposed to be ringing me up is standing there eating my Almond Joy.<br /><br />New Rule: Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it doesn&#39;t make you spiritual. It&#39;s right above the crack of your ass. And it translates to beef with broccoli.&quot; The last time you did anything spiritual, you were praying to God you weren&#39;t pregnant. You&#39;re not spiritual. You&#39;re just high.<br /><br />New Rule: Competitive eating isn&#39;t a sport. It&#39;s one of the seven deadly sins. ESPN recently televised the US Open of Competitive Eating, because watching those athletes at the poker table was just too damned exciting. <br />What&#39;s next, competitive farting? Oh wait. They&#39;re already doing that. <br />It&#39;s called &quot;The Howard Stern Show.&quot;<br /><br />New Rule: I don&#39;t need a bigger mega M&amp;M. If I&#39;m extra hungry for M&amp;Ms, I&#39;ll go nuts and eat two.<br /><br />New Rule: If you&#39;re going to insist on making movies based on crappy, old television shows, then you have to give everyone in the Cineplex a remote so we can see what&#39;s playing on the other screens. Let&#39;s remember the reason something was a television show in the first place is that the idea wasn&#39;t good enough to be a movie.<br /><br />New Rule: No more gift registries. You know, it used to be just for weddings. Now it&#39;s for babies and new homes and graduations from rehab. <br />Picking out the stuff you want and having other people buy it for you isn&#39;t gift giving, it&#39;s the white people version of looting.<br /><br />George Carlin

				While walking down the street one day a US senator is tragically hit by a truck and dies.<br /><br />His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.<br /><br />”Welcome to heaven,” says St. Peter. “Before you settle in,  it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts ,you see, so we’re not sure what to do with you.”<br /><br />”No problem, just let me in,” says the man.<br /><br />”Well, I’d like to, but I have orders from higher up. What we’ll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.”<br /><br />”Really, I’ve made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,” says the senator.<br /><br />”I’m sorry, but we have our rules.”<br /><br />And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in<br />front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.<br /><br />Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people.<br /><br />They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and champagne.<br /><br />Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy &amp; who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time that before he realizes it, it is time to go.<br /><br />Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises...<br /><br />The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.  “Now it’s time to visit heaven.”<br /><br />So, 24 hours pass with the senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St.<br />Peter returns.<br /><br />”Well, then, you’ve spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.”<br /><br />The senator reflects for a minute, then he answers:  “Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.”<br /><br />So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell.<br /><br />Now the doors of the elevator open and he’s in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage.<br /><br />He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above.<br /><br />The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. “I don’t understand,” stammers the senator. “Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar,<br />drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there’s just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?”<br /><br />The devil looks at him, smiles and says,  “Yesterday we were campaigning...... Today you voted.”

				An Eskimo decided he needed a new snowmobile, so he went to several dealerships to get the best deal. The one he decided to buy came witha mobile phone and a guarantee that if it ever broke down, he could call the company on the phone and they would be there within one hour to fix it. <br /><br />After a few months it began running really bad but he managed to make it back to his igloo and call the company. They promised they would be there within the hour, and the eskimo decided to have a bite of lunch while he waited. Sure enough, about 45 minutes later, a helicopter landed and a mechanic went to work on the snowmoblie.<br /><br />After he finished his lunch he went out and asked the mechanic &quot;did you find the problem?&quot; the mechanic replied &quot;looks like you&#39;ve blown a seal.&quot; The eskimo replied &quot;nah, that&#39;s just some mayonnaise off my ham sandwich&#33;&quot;

				It was George the mailman&#39;s last day on the job after 35 years of  <br />carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the same neighborhood. <br /><br /><br />When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by  the <br />whole family there, who roundly and soundly congratulated him and  sent <br />him on his way with a tidy gift envelope. <br /><br />At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. <br /><br />The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific  fishing <br />lures. <br /><br />At the fourth house, a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing  <br />negligee met him at the door. She took him by the hand, gently led  him <br />through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up  the <br />stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most  passionate <br />love he had ever experienced. <br /><br />When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a  <br />giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and  <br />fresh-squeezed orange juice. <br /><br />When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee.  As <br />she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under  the <br />cup&#39;s bottom edge. <br /><br />&quot;All this was just too wonderful for words,&quot; he said, &quot;but what&#39;s  the <br />dollar for?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;last night, I told my husband that today would be  <br />your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I  asked <br />him what to give you. <br /><br />He said, &#39;Fuck him. Give him a dollar.&#39; <br /><br />The breakfast was my idea.&quot;

				Two Jehovah Witnesses were going door to door. They knocked on Tammy&#39;s door.  Tammy clearly was not happy to see them. She told them in no uncertain terms she did not want to hear their message and then slammed the door in their faces.<br />To Tammy&#39;s surprise, the door did not close. In fact, it bounced back open. Seeing the two Jehovah Witnesses at the door frustrated her. She stormed back to the door and flung it shut.<br />But the door still didn&#39;t close. Furious, she grabbed the door with two hands and shoved it as hard as she could. But again, the door wouldn&#39;t shut.<br />Convinced one of these rude Jehovah Witnesses was sticking a foot in the door, she reared back to give the door a slam that would really teach them a lesson.<br />Just then, one of the Jehovah Witnesses said, &quot;Ma&#39;am, before you do that again, you might want to move your cat.&quot;

				<i>A teacher gave her class of 11 year olds an assignment: To get their<br />parent to tell them a story with a moral at the end of it.<br /><br />The next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their<br />stories.<br /><br />Ashley said, &quot;My father&#39;s a farmer and we have a lot of egg-laying hens.<br />One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat<br />of the car when we hit a big bump in the road and all the eggs got<br />broken.<br /><br />&quot;What&#39;s the moral of that story?&quot; asked the teacher.<br /><br />&quot;Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket&#33;&quot; &quot;Very good,&quot; said the teacher.<br /><br />Next, little Sarah raised her hand and said, &quot;Our family are Farmers<br />too. But we raise chickens for the meat market. One day we had a dozen<br />eggs, but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks, and the moral<br />to this story is, &#39;Don&#39;t count your chickens before they&#39;re hatched&#39;.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That was a fine story Sarah.&quot; said the teacher. Michael, do you have a<br />story to share?&quot; asked the teacher.<br /><br />&quot;Yes. My daddy told me this story about my Aunty Cath. Aunty Cath was a<br />flight engineer on a plane in the Gulf War and her plane got hit. She<br />had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of<br />Vodka, a machine gun and a machete. She drank the Vodka on the way down<br />so it wouldn&#39;t break and then she landed right in the middle of 100<br />enemy troops. She killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she<br />ran out of bullets. Then she killed twenty more with the machete until<br />the blade broke. And then she killed the last ten with her bare hands.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Good heavens,&quot; said the horrified teacher, &quot;What kind of moral did your<br />daddy tell you from that horrible story?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Stay the f**k away from Aunty Cath when she&#39;s been drinking.&quot;</i>

It<br />was Momma Bear who  got up first, it was Momma Bear who woke everyone in<br />the house, it was Momma  Bear who made the coffee, it was Momma Bear who<br />unloaded the dishwasher from  last night, and put everything away. It was<br />Momma Bear who went out in the  cold early morning air to fetch the<br />newspaper, it was Momma Bear who set the  damn table, it was Momma Bear<br />who put the friggin&#39; cat out, cleaned the  litter box, and filled the<br />cat&#39;s water and food dish, and . . . now that  you&#39;ve decided to drag your<br />sorry bear-asses downstairs, and grace Momma  Bear&#39;s kitchen with your<br />grumpy presence, listen good, cause I&#39;m only going  to say this one time:<br /><br />I HAVEN&#39;T MADE THE DAMN PORRIDGE YET&#33;&#33;&quot;

				A guy calls a company and orders their 5-day, 10 lb. weight <br />loss program. The next day, there&#39;s a knock on the door and there <br />stands before him a voluptuous, athletic, 19 year old babe dressed <br />in nothing but a pair of Nike running shoes and a sign round her <br />neck. She introduces herself as a representative of the weight <br />loss company. The sign reads: &quot;If you can catch me, you can have <br />me.&quot; Without a second thought, he takes off after her. A few miles <br />later, huffing and puffing, he finally catches her and has his way <br />with her. The same girl shows up for the next four days and the <br />same thing happens. On the fifth day, he weighs himself and is <br />delighted to find he has lost 10lb as promised.<br /><br /><br /><br /> He then calls the company and orders their 5-day/20 pound <br />program. The next day there&#39;s a knock at the door and there stands <br />the most stunning, beautiful, sexy woman he has ever seen in his <br />life. She is wearing nothing but Reebok running shoes and a sign <br />around her neck that reads &quot;If you catch me you can have me.&quot; <br />Well, he&#39;s out the door after her like a shot&#33; This girl is in <br />excellent shape and it takes him a while to catch her but when he <br />does, it&#39;s definitely worth every muscle cramp and wheeze, and for <br />the next four days he catches her and has his wicked way with her. <br />On the fifth day he weighs himself only to discover that he has <br />lost another 20lb as promised.<br /><br /><br /><br /> He decides to go for broke and calls the company to order the <br />7-day/50 pound program. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; asks the representative on <br />the phone. &quot;This is our most rigorous program.&quot; &quot;Absolutely,&quot; he <br />replies, &quot;I haven&#39;t felt this good in years.&quot; The next day there&#39;s <br />a knock at the door; when he opens it he finds this huge, <br />muscular, 7ft black man standing there wearing nothing but pink <br />running shoes and a sign around his neck that reads: &quot;I&#39;m Francis. <br />If I catch you, you&#39;re mine...&quot;

				On a chain of beautiful deserted islands in the middle of nowhere,  the following people are stranded: <br /><br />- Two Italian men and one Italian woman<br />- Two French men and one French woman<br />- Two German men and one German woman<br />- Two Greek men and one Greek woman<br />- Two English men and one English woman<br />- Two Bulgarian men and one Bulgarian woman<br />- Two Japanese men and one Japanese woman<br />- Two Chinese men and one Chinese woman<br />- Two Irish men and one Irish woman<br />- Two American men and one American woman <br /><br />One month later, on these absolutely stunning deserted islands in  the middle of nowhere, the following things have occurred: <br /><br />One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman. <br /><br />The two French men and the French woman are living happily together in a menage a trois. <br /><br />The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of alternating visits with the German woman. <br /><br />The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them. <br /><br />The two English men are waiting for someone to introduce them to the English woman. <br /><br />The two Bulgarian men took one look at the Bulgarian woman and started swimming to another island. <br /><br />The two Japanese have faxed Tokyo and are awaiting instructions. <br /><br />The two Chinese men have set up a pharmacy/liquor/store/restaurant/ laundry, and have gotten the woman pregnant in order to supply employees for their store. <br /><br />The two Irish men divided the island into North and South and set up a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture because it gets somewhat foggy after a few liters of coconut whiskey.  However, they&#39;re satisfied because the English aren&#39;t having any fun. <br /><br />The two American men are contemplating suicide, because the American woman will not shut up and complains relentlessly about her body, the true nature of feminism, what the sun is doing to her skin, how she  can do anything they can do, the necessity of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how sand and palm trees make her look fat, how her last boyfriend respected her opinion and treated her  nicer than they do, and how her relationship with her mother is the  root cause of all her problems, and why didn&#39;t they bring a damn cell  phone so they could call 911 and get them all rescued off this  godforsaken deserted island in the middle of friggin&#39; nowhere so she  can go to the spa, get her nails done, get a &quot;hot rock massage&quot;, and  go shopping...

				Three men were sitting together bragging about how they had given their<br />   new wives duties.<br />   <br />   Terry had married a woman from America, and bragged that he had told his<br />   wife she needed to do all the dishes and housework. He said that it took<br />   a couple days but on the third day he came home to a clean house and the<br />   dishes were all washed and put away.<br />   <br />   Jimmie had married a woman from Asia. He bragged that he had given his<br />   wife orders that she was to do all the cleaning, dishes, and the<br />   cooking. He told them that the first day he didn&#39;t see any results, but<br />   the next day it was better. By the third day, his house was clean, the<br />   dishes were done, and he had a huge dinner on the table.<br />   <br />   The third man had married an Australian girl. He boasted that he told<br />   her that her duties were to keep the house cleaned, dishes washed,<br />   laundry and ironing twice a week, lawns mowed, windows cleaned and hot<br />   meals on the table for every meal. He said the first day he didn&#39;t see<br />   anything, the second day he didn&#39;t see anything, but by the third day<br />   most of the swelling had gone down and he could see a little out of his<br />   left eye. Enough to fix himself a bite to eat, load the dishwasher,<br />  and<br />   call a handyman.<br />   <br />   God Bless Australian Women ...

				My friend lollie strikes again....<br /><br />When you&#39;re PMSing and needing a reason to give that man hell, sometimes your hormones are messing with you so hard you can&#39;t come up with an innocent looking question that will wind up hurting your feelings and starting that inevitable no-ones-going-to-win fight.    <b>Girls, here they are. Gentlemen, quake at the sight of:</b>   <b>The 5 Questions Most Feared By Men<br /></b>  <br /><b>1.</b> What are you thinking about? <br /><b>2.</b> Do you love me? <br /><b>3.</b> Do I look fat in this? <br /><b>4.</b> Do you think she is prettier than me? <br /><b>5.</b> What would you do if I died? <br /><br />What makes these questions so difficult is that each one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e. tells the truth). Therefore, as a public service to the men reading this, each question is analyzed below, along with possible responses. <br /><br /><b>Question #1: What are you thinking about?</b> The proper answer to this, of course, is: &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;ve been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you.&quot; <br /><br />This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which most likely is one of the following: a. &quot;Football.&quot; b. &quot;Golf.&quot; c. &quot;How fat you are.&quot; d. &quot;How I would spend the insurance money if you died.&quot; <br /><br />Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, &quot;If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you&#33;&quot; <br /><br /><b>Question #2: Do you love me?</b> The proper response is: &quot;Yes&#33;&quot; or, if you feel a more detailed answer is in order, &quot;Yes, dear.&quot; <br /><br />Inappropriate responses include: a. &quot;Oh yeah, sh*tloads.&quot; b. &quot;Would it make you feel better if I said yes?&quot; c. &quot;That depends on what you mean by love.&quot; d. &quot;Does it matter?&quot; e. &quot;Who, me?&quot; <br /><br /><b>Question #3: Do I look fat?</b> The correct answer is an emphatic: &quot;Of course not&#33;&quot; <br /><br />Incorrect answers are: a. &quot;Compared to what?&quot; b. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t call you fat, but you&#39;re not exactly thin.&quot; c. &quot;A little extra weight looks good on you.&quot; d. &quot;I&#39;ve seen fatter.&quot; e. &quot;Sorry, what did you say? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.&quot; <br /><br /><b>Question #4: Do you think she&#39;s prettier than me?</b> Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: &quot;Of course not&#33;&quot; <br /><br />Incorrect responses include: a. &quot;Yes, but you have a better personality.&quot; b. &quot;Not prettier, but definitely thinner.&quot; c. &quot;Not as pretty as you when you were her age.&quot; d. &quot;Define pretty.&quot; e. &quot;Sorry what did you say? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.&quot; <br /><br /><b>Question #5: What would you do if I died?</b> A definite no-win question. (The real answer, of course, is &quot;Buy a Ferrari and a boat.&quot;) <br /><br />No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an hour of follow-up questions, usually along these lines: <br /><br />Woman: Would you get married again? <br />Man: Definitely not&#33; <br />Woman: Why not -- don&#39;t you like being married? <br />Man: Of course I do. <br />Woman: Then why wouldn&#39;t you remarry? <br />Man: Okay, I&#39;d get married again. <br />Woman: You would? (With a hurtful look on her face) <br />Man: (audible groan) <br />Woman: Would you sleep with her in our bed? <br />Man: Where else would we sleep? <br />Woman: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of her? <br />Man: That would seem like the proper thing to do. <br />Woman: And would you let her use my golf clubs? <br />Man: She can&#39;t use them -- she&#39;s left-handed. <br />Woman: (silence)<br />Man: Sh*t.

				A large woman, wearing a sleeveless sun dress, walked into a bar. She raised her right arm, revealing a huge, hairy armpit as she pointed to all the people sitting at the bar and asked, &quot;What man here will buy a lady a drink?&quot;<br /><br />The bar went silent as the patrons tried to ignore her.<br /><br />But down at the end of the bar, an owl-eyed very, very drunk man slammed his hand down on the counter and bellowed, &quot;Give the ballerina a drink&#33;&quot;<br /><br />The bartender poured the drink and the woman chugged it down.<br /><br />She turned to the patrons and again pointed around at all of them, revealing the same hairy armpit, and asked,<br /><br />&quot;What man here will buy a lady a drink?&quot;<br /><br />Once again, the same little owl-eyed drunk slapped his money down on the bar and said &quot;Give the ballerina another drink&#33;&quot;<br /><br />The bartender approached the little owl-eyed drunk and said, &quot;I say, old chap, it&#39;s your business if you want to buy the lady a drink, but why do you keep calling her the ballerina?&quot;<br /><br />The drunk replied: &quot;Any woman who can lift her leg that high has to be a ballerina&#33;

				Wednesday, November 2 12:00 AM ET<br /><br />          <br /><b>Bush Proposes Faith-Based Firewalls for Government Computers</b><br />  By <a href="mailto:briggsb@bbspot.com">Brian Briggs </a> <br /> <br />         digg_url = &#39;http://www.digg.com/offbeat_news/Bush_Proposes_Faith-Based_Firewalls_for_Government_Computers&#39;;   reddit_url=&#39;http://www.bbspot.com/News/2005/11/faith_based_firewalls.html&#39;    Washington D.C. – President Bush announced that by 2008 all government computers should be protected from outside attacks by the faith-based firewall called Protection From Above (PFA) from Houston-based software developer Christisoft. <br /><br /> <img src="http://www.bbspot.com/Images/News_Features/2005/11/computer2.jpg" border="0" class="linked-image" />&quot;For too long we have turned to proven software companies with expertise in computer security for protection, now our computers will be protected by the power of prayer at a much lower cost to taxpayers,&quot; said Bush.<br /><br /> Estimates show the US government spent &#036;1.2 billion dollars to secure their computer systems at various agencies, which many Republicans think is an indulgence the government can&#39;t afford.<br /><br /> &quot;With the faith-based firewall and other faith-based security software from Christisoft we could save billions over the next ten years. That&#39;s money that can be returned to the most generous of taxpayers,&quot; said the President.<br /><br /> Bush also cited doubts about the efficacy &quot;of science-based computer security&quot; though he didn&#39;t use that word exactly. <br /><br /> The software requires no installation or maintenance fees, but only a onetime registration fee for unlimited computers.<br /><br /> Joel Osgood, founder of Christisoft, said, &quot;With the one time registration fee, a company&#39;s entire network of computers joins our network of computer security prayer specialists. The power of prayer can heal the soul and can also protect you from nasty denial of service attacks and viruses.&quot;<br /><br /> Specialists in IT departments at various government agencies said they weren&#39;t contacted by the White House for any feedback on the system and they believe the President&#39;s decision would be &quot;disastrous&quot; for computer security. <br /><br />     <!--coloro:#ffffff--><span style="color:#ffffff"><!--/coloro--><b>Related News</b><!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc-->      <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/Features/2001/02/obsecurity_server.html" target="_blank">Microsoft Obsecurity - World&#39;s Most Secure Server FAQ</a><br /><br /> <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/Features/2001/08/Top_11_patch.html" target="_blank">Top 11 Reasons You Haven&#39;t Patched IIS Yet</a><br /><br />  <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2005/04/bush_social_security.html" target="_blank">Bush Unveils New Social Security Plan</a><br /><br />     Osgood refuted critics who said prayer can&#39;t protect from cyberattacks by saying, &quot;Computers are extremely complicated devices that mere humans couldn&#39;t dream of understanding. It takes the power of God to do that.&quot;<br /><br /> Any security breaches in the PFA software are countered by a double-prayer guarantee. <br /><br /> Osgood said Christisoft&#39;s customer list includes a Fortune 500 company currently being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.

				An oldie but a goodie&#33;<br /><br /><br />A jumbo jet is just coming into the Tampa Airport on its final  <br />approach. The pilot comes on the intercom, &quot;This is your  <br />Captain. We&#39;re on our final descent into Tampa. I want to thank  <br />you for flying with us today and I hope you enjoy your stay  <br />in Tampa Bay&quot;.  <br /><br />He forgets to switch off the intercom. Now the whole plane can  <br />hear his conversation from the cockpit. The copilot says to  <br />the pilot, &quot;Well, skipper, watcha gonna do in Tampa?&quot;  <br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; says the skipper, &quot;first I&#39;m gonna check into the hotel  <br />and take a big crap.... then I&#39;m gonna take that new stewardess  <br />with the huge tits out for dinner..... then I&#39;m gonna wine  <br />and dine her, take her back to my room and put it to her big  <br />time all night.&quot;  <br /><br />Everyone on the plane hears this and immediately begins looking  <br />up and down the aisle trying to get a look at the new  <br />stewardess.  <br /><br />Meanwhile the new stewardess is at the very back of the plane.  <br />She&#39;s so embarrassed that she starts to run to try and get to  <br />the cockpit to turn the intercom off. Halfway down the aisle,  <br />she trips over an old lady&#39;s bag and down she goes.  <br /><br />The old lady leans over and says: &quot;No need to hurry, dear.  <br />He&#39;s gotta take a shit first.&quot;  <br /><br /><br />-------<br /><br />When I was single old aunts used to come up to me at weddings, poking me<br />in the ribs and cackling, telling me, &quot;You&#39;re next.&quot;<br /><br /><br />They stopped after I started doing the same thing to them at funerals&#33;

				Gary is 95 and lives in a senior citizen home. Every night after dinner, Gary goes to a secluded garden behind the center to sit and ponder his accomplishments and long life. One evening, Mildred, age 87, wanders into the garden. They begin to chat, and before they know it, several hours have passed. After a short lull in their conversation Gary turns to Mildred and asks, &quot;Do you know what I miss most of all?&quot;<br /><br />She asks, &quot;What?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;SEX&#33;&quot; he replies.<br /><br />Mildred exclaims, &quot;Why you old fart, you couldn&#39;t get it up if I held a gun to your head&#33;&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I know,&quot; Gary says, &quot;but it would be nice if a woman could just hold it for a while.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, I can oblige,&quot; says Mildred, who unzips his trousers, removes his manhood and proceeds to hold it. Afterward, they agree to meet secretly each night in the garden where they would sit and talk and Mildred would hold Gary&#39;s manhood.<br /><br />Then, one night, Gary didn&#39;t show up at their usual meeting place. Alarmed, Mildred decided to find Gary and make sure he was O.K.<br /><br />She walked around the senior citizen home where she found him sitting by the pool with another female resident, Ethel, who was holding Gary&#39;s manhood. Furious, Mildred yelled, &quot;You two-timing creep&#33; What does Ethel have that I don&#39;t have?&quot;<br /><br />Gary smiled happily and replied, &quot;Parkinson&#39;s.&quot;

Tom Mabe has made three CD&#39;s recording phone calls with telemarketers and jackin&#39; with &#39;em.  They can&#39;t hang up unless he says he&#39;s not interested.

				Ten Thoughts to Ponder for 2007<br />Number 10<br />Life is sexually transmitted.<br />Number 9<br />Good health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one<br />can die.<br />Number 8<br />Men have two emotions: Hungry and Horny. If you see him without an erection, make him a sandwich.<br />Number 7<br />Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day; teach a person to use the Internet and they won&#39;t bother you for weeks.<br />Number 6<br />Some people are like a Slinky.....not really good for anything, but you still can&#39;t help but smile when you shove them down the stairs.<br />Number 5<br />Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in hospitals dying of nothing.<br />Number 4<br />All of us could take a lesson from the weather. It pays no attention to criticism.<br />Number 3<br />Why does a slight tax increase cost you two hundred pounds and a substantial tax cut saves you thirty pence?<br />Number 2<br />In the 60s, people took acid to make the world weird.  Now the world is weird and people take Prozac to make it normal.<br />AND THE NUMBER 1 THOUGHT FOR 2007:<br />We know exactly where one cow with Mad-cow-disease is located among the millions of cows, but we haven&#39;t got a clue as to where thousands of illegal immigrants and terrorists are? Maybe we should put the Department of Agriculture in charge of immigration.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A wealthy old lady decides to go on a photo safari in Africa, taking her faithful, elderly poodle named Cuddles, along for the company. One day the old poodle starts chasing butterflies and before long, Cuddles discovers that he&#39;s lost. Wandering about, he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the intention of having lunch. The old poodle thinks, &quot;Oh, oh&#33; I&#39;m in deep doo-doo now&#33;&quot; Noticing some bones on the ground close by, he immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat. Just as the leopard is about to leap the old poodle exclaims loudly, &quot;Boy, that was one delicious leopard&#33; I wonder if there are any more around here?&quot; Hearing this, the young leopard halts his attack in mid-strike, a look of  terror comes over him and he slinks away into the trees. &quot;Whew&#33;&quot;, says the leopard, &quot;That was close&#33; That old poodle nearly had me&#33;&quot;<br /><br />Meanwhile, a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree, figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard. So off he goes, but the old poodle sees him heading after the leopard with great speed, and figures that something must be up. The monkey soon catches up with the leopard, spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard.<br /><br />The young leopard is furious at being made a fool of and says, &quot;Here, monkey, hop on my back and see what&#39;s going to happen to that conniving canine&#33;&quot;<br /><br />Now, the old poodle sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back and thinks, &quot;What am I going to do now?&quot;, but instead of running, the dog sits down with his back to his attackers, pretending he hasn&#39;t seen them yet, and just when they get close enough to hear, the old poodle says...<br /><br />&quot;Where&#39;s that damn monkey? I sent him off an hour ago to bring me another leopard&#33;&quot;<br /> <br />Moral of this story....<br /> <br />Don&#39;t mess with old farts...age and skill will always overcome youth and treachery&#33; Bullshit and brilliance only come with age and experience.<br /> <br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />Gotta love the church lady&#33;<br /><br />Miss Beatrice, the church organist, was in her eighties and had never been married. She was admired for her sweetness and kindness to all. One afternoon the pastor came to call on her and she showed him into her quaint sitting room. She invited him to have a seat while she prepared tea. As he sat facing her old Hammond organ, the young minister noticed a cut-glass bowl sitting on top of it.<br />&gt;The bowl was filled with water, and in the water floated, of all things, a condom&#33; When she returned with tea and scones, they began to chat. The pastor tried to stifle his curiosity about the bowl of water and its strange floater, but soon it got the better of him and he could no longer resist.<br /> <br />&quot;Miss Beatrice,&quot; he said, &quot;I wonder if you would tell me about this?&quot; pointing to the bowl. &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; she replied, &quot;Isn&#39;t it wonderful?<br />I was walking through the Park a few months ago and I found this little package on the ground. The directions said to place it on the organ, keep it wet and that it would prevent the spread of disease. Do you know I haven&#39;t had the flu all winter.&quot;

				I very rarely send out one of these &quot;warn all your friends&quot; e-mails,<br />      but I believe THIS scam truly warrants it.<br /><br /><br />      A &quot;heads up&quot; for you and any friends you have who may be regular Home<br />      Depot customers.<br /><br />      Over the last month I became a victim of a clever scam while out<br />      shopping. Simply going out to get supplies has turned out to be quite<br />      traumatic. Don&#39;t be naive enough to think it couldn&#39;t happen to you or<br /><br />      your husband.<br /><br />      Here&#39;s how the scam works:<br /><br />      Two seriously good-looking 18 or 19-year-old girls come over to your<br />      car as you are packing your shopping in the trunk. They both start<br />      wiping your windshield with a rag and Windex, with their breasts<br />      almost falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. It is impossible not to<br />      look. When you thank them and offer them a tip, they say &quot;No thank you&quot; <br /><br />      and instead ask you for a ride to another Home Depot where they say they<br /><br />      have to clean more car windshields.<br /><br />      You agree and they get in the back seat. On the way, they start<br />      having sex with each other. Then one of them climbs over into the<br />      front seat and performs oral sex on you, while the other one steals<br />      your wallet.<br /><br />      I had my wallet stolen on January 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, three<br />      times just yesterday, and very likely will have it stolen again this <br />      upcoming weekend.<br /><br /> <br /><br />      Warn everyone to beware of these girls...

				Anna had lost her husband almost four years ago and was becoming quite<br />&gt; &gt;the recluse. Her daughter was constantly calling and urging her to get<br />&gt; &gt;back into the world. Finally, Anna said she wouldn&#39;t mind going out,<br />&gt;but<br />&gt; &gt;didn&#39;t know anyone.<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;A few days later her daughter told her, &quot;Mom I have someone for you to<br />&gt; &gt;meet&quot;. Well, it was an immediate hit. They really took to one another<br />&gt; &gt;and after dating for six weeks, he asked her to join him for a weekend<br />&gt; &gt;in Vermont.<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;She happily, if not cautiously, accepted.<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;The first night there she undressed, as did he. There she stood nude,<br />&gt; &gt;except for a pair of black lacy panties; he was in his birthday suit.<br />&gt; &gt;Looking her over, he asked, &quot;Why the black panties? She replied: &quot;My<br />&gt; &gt;breasts you can fondle, my body is yours to explore, but down there I<br />&gt;am<br />&gt; &gt;still in mourning.&quot;<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;He knew he was not getting lucky that night.<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;The following night was the same - she stood there wearing the black<br />&gt; &gt;panties, and he was in his birthday suit but now he was wearing a black<br />&gt; &gt;condom. She looked at him and asked:<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;What&#39;s with the black condom?&quot;<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;He replied, &quot;I want to offer my deepest condolences.&quot;

				A  frog goes into a bank and approaches the teller. He can see from  her nameplate that her name is Patricia Whack. <br /> <br />&quot;Miss  Whack, I&#39;d like to get a £30,000 loan to take a  holiday.&quot;  <br /> <br />Patty  looks at the frog in disbelief and asks his name. The frog says  his name is Kermit Jagger, his dad is Mick Jagger, and that it&#39;s  okay, he knows the bank manager. <br /> <br />Patty explains that he  will need to secure the loan with some collateral.<br /> <br />The  frog says, &quot;Sure. I have this,&quot; and produces a tiny porcelain  elephant, about an inch tall, bright pink and perfectly  formed. <br /> <br />Very confused, Patty explains that she&#39;ll have to  consult with the bank manager and disappears into a back  office.<br /> <br />She finds the manager and says, &quot;There&#39;s a frog  called Kermit Jagger out there who claims to know you and wants  to borrow £30,000, and he wants to use this as  collateral.&quot; <br /> <br />She holds up the tiny pink elephant. &quot;I  mean, what in the world is this?&quot;<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><br />(wait for it)<br /> <br /><br />The bank manager  looks back at her and says...<br /> <br />&quot;It&#39;s a knickknack, Patty  Whack. Give the frog a loan. His old man&#39;s a Rolling  Stone.&quot; <br /> <br />(You&#39;re singing it, aren&#39;t you? Yeah, I know you  are........)

				A good looking man walked into an agent&#39;s office in Hollywoodand said<br /> &quot;I want to be a movie star.&quot; Tall, handsome and with experience on Broadway, he had the right credentials.<br /><br /> The agent asked, &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br /><br /> The guy said, &quot;My name is Penis van Lesbian.&quot;<br /><br /> The agent said, &quot;Sir, I hate to tell you, but in order to get into Hollywood, you are going to have to change your name.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;I will NOT change my name&#33; The van Lesbian name is centuries old,<br /><br /> I will not disrespect my grandfather by changing my name. Not ever.&quot;<br /><br /> The agent said, &quot;Sir, I have worked in Hollywoodfor years... you will NEVER go far in Hollywood with a name like Penis  van Lesbian&#33; I&#39;m telling you, you will HAVE TO change your name or I will not be able to represent you.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;So be it&#33; I guess we will not do business together&quot; the guy said and he left the agent&#39;s office.<br /><br /> FIVE YEARS LATER..... The agent opens an envelope sent to his office.<br /> Inside the envelope is a letter and a check for &#036;50,000. The agent is awe-struck, who would possibly send him &#036; 50,000?<br /><br /> He reads the letter enclosed...<br />&quot;Dear Sir, <br />Five years ago, I came into your office wanting to become an actor in Hollywood, you told me I needed to change my name.<br /> Determined to make it with my God-given birth name, I refused. You told me I would never make it in Hollywood with a name like Penis van Lesbian. After I left your office, I thought about what you said. I decided you were right. I had to change my name. I had too much pride to return to your office, so I signed with another agent. I would never have made it without changing my name, so the enclosed check is a token of my appreciation.<br /><br /> Thank you for your advice.<br /> Sincerely,<br /><br />Dick van Dyke

				Got this from my half Irish mother.  Irish jokes.  If ya&#39; ain&#39;t Irish, don&#39;t pay attention.  If you are Irish, have a laugh.<br /><br /><b><!--coloro:#006600--><span style="color:#006600"><!--/coloro-->Paddy was driving down the street in a sweat because he had an important meeting and couldn&#39;t find a parking place.   Looking up to heaven he said, &quot;Lord take pity on me.   If you find me a parking place I will go to Mass every Sunday for the rest of me life and give up me Irish Whiskey&#33;&quot;<br /><br />Miraculously, a parking place appeared.<br /><br />Paddy looked up again and said, &quot;Never mind, I found one.&quot;<br /><br />________________________________________________________________________________<br />___________<br /><br /><br />An Irish priest is driving down to New York and gets stopped for speeding in Connecticut.  The state trooper smells alcohol on the priest&#39;s breath and then sees an empty wine bottle on the floor of the car.<br /><br />He says, &quot;Sir, have you been drinking?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Just water,&quot; says the priest.<br /><br />The trooper says, &quot;Then why do I smell wine?&quot;<br /><br />The priest looks at the bottle and says, &quot;Good Lord&#33; He&#39;s done it again&#33;&quot;<br /><br />________________________________________________________________________________<br />___________<br /><br /><br /><br />Flynn staggered home very late after another evening with his drinking buddy, Paddy.  He took off his shoes to avoid waking his wife, Mary.<br /><br />He tiptoed as quietly as he could toward the stairs leading to their upstairs bedroom, but misjudged the bottom step.  As he caught himself by grabbing the banister, his body swung around and he landed heavily on his rump.  A whiskey bottle in each back pocket broke and made the landing especially painful.<br /><br />Managing not to yell, Flynn sprung up, pulled down his pants, and looked in the hall mirror to see that his butt cheeks were cut and bleeding.  He managed to quietly find a full box of Band-Aids and began putting a Band-Aid as best he could on each place he saw blood.<br /><br />He then hid the now almost empty Band-Aid box and shuffled and stumbled his way to bed.<br /><br />In the morning, Flynn woke up with searing pain in both his head and butt and Mary staring at him from across the room.<br /><br />She said, &quot;You were drunk again last night weren&#39;t you?&quot;<br /><br />Flynn said, &quot;Why do you say such a mean thing?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well,&quot; Mary said, &quot;it could be the open front door, it could be the broken glass at the bottom of the stairs, it could be the drops of blood trailing through the house, it could be your bloodshot eyes, but mostly.....it&#39;s all those Band-Aids stuck on the hall mirror.  <!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc--></b><br /><br /><br /><!--sizeo:4--><span style="font-size:14pt;line-height:100%"><!--/sizeo--><b><!--coloro:#006600--><span style="color:#006600"><!--/coloro-->Erin Go Bragh&#33;<!--colorc--></span><!--/colorc--></b><!--sizec--></span><!--/sizec-->

				An attorney got home late one evening, after a very taxing day trying<br />    to get a stay of execution for a client, James Wright, who was due to be<br />    hanged  for murder at midnight.<br />    His last-minute plea for clemency to the<br />    governor had  failed and he was feeling worn out and depressed.<br />   <br />    As soon as he got through the door at home, his wife started on him about,<br />    &quot;What time of night do you call this? Where have you been?&quot; and on and on.<br />   <br />    Too shattered to play his usual role in this familiar ritual, he went and<br />    poured himself a shot of whisky and headed off for a long hot soak in the bathtub,<br />     pursued by the predictable sarcastic remarks.<br />   <br />    While he was in the bath, the phone rang. The wife answered and was<br />    told  that her husband&#39;s client had been granted his stay of execution<br />    after all.<br />   <br />    Finally realizing what a day he must have had, she decided to go<br />   upstairs to give him the good news.<br />   <br />    As she opened the bathroom door, she was greeted by the sight of<br />    her  husband&#39;s rear end as he was bent over naked drying his legs and  feet.<br />   <br />    &quot;They&#39;re not hanging Wright tonight,&quot; she said.<br />   <br />    He whirled around and screamed, &quot;FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, WOMAN, DON&#39;T<br />    YOU  EVER LET UP?&quot;
