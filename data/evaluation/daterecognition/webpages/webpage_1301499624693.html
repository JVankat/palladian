						<p>Hello again,</p>

<p>I wanted to share some news - and of course to respond to comments which I thought might be most easily done as a single post.</p>

<p>First a couple of developments to share. </p>

<p>Those paying close attention may have noticed that for the first time today outside of a major event, the <a href="http://bbc.co.uk/bbchd">BBC HD</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbchd/programmes/schedules">schedule</a> is up at 9 hours. That's the full service that we have permission for from the <a href="http://bbc.co.uk/bbctrust">BBC Trust</a>, and from now on (until there is any extension to the service) the channel we plan to deliver to you. </p>

<p>We'll start daily at 4pm, and run through to between 12.30 and 1.30 7 nights a week although we will of course still extend the channel hours when there are sporting or other events that fall outside those hours. I would welcome your feedback on how far predictability - for example of the kinds of programmes you can expect say on a Saturday evening, or from 4 to 6 on a weekday - is useful to you because I am trying to build greater consistency into the schedule. </p>

<p>With a new scheduling team on board we will be making some changes over the coming months, which I would hope can plan your time with the channel. It is inevitably tricky given the fact that we are juggling with programmes from across BBC channels, and trying to follow their schedules and broadcast programmes at the same time where it makes most sense to do so.  </p>

<p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45568000/jpg/_45568982_anthems_416.jpg" align="right">Getting to nine hours is quite a milestone in the life of BBC HD, although as some of you have suggested, it is in the end what's on the channel inside those hours that matters most. We are working on that too - no specific announcements at this time but we are keeping busy. </p>

<p>Before you ask the inevitable question I have to tell you that unfortunately there will be no BBC HD <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7940061.stm">showing of The Wire</a> - not because of lack of money or lack of will, but because the series is made on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betacam#Digital_Betacam">digibeta</a>. </p>

<p>Getting some of the programmes I think need to move into HD may mean though a slight shake up of some of the things that have featured in the past - hopefully you will agree with the choices, but as one example there will be no <a href="http://www.rhs.org.uk/whatson/shows/chelsea2009/">Chelsea Flower Show</a> this year in HD. Getting more of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/default.stm">Six Nations</a> in HD is a goal for next year - as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/profile/?userid=1397829">scarlet supporter</a> has picked up, there are no France and Italy based fixtures in the mix. That's part of a decision about how to spend our Sport HD budget most effectively and was the case last year too I believe. I can't promise it will change, but it is under discussion as we consider how best to extend the BBC HD sport offer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/profile/?userid=2630446">Disrember</a> is right in observing that there's inconsistency in film availability in HD - quite simply, studios are not always prepared to make HD versions available, and sometimes the scheduling of films means that we don't have time to acquire an HD version when we want to show them. But also, BBC HD is never going to be a movie channel - Sky movie services already do that very well, and what we're trying to do is something different. Film is a pretty small part of our content offer, and is likely to remain a limited part of the schedule.  </p>

<p>A couple of you, including <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/profile/?userid=5354265">ropies</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/profile/?userid=1946566">wednesday83</a>, are asking about channel promotion and whether the BBC is putting sufficient welly behind HD. Firstly, there's another burst of on air promotion coming up early next month, linked to some on-air changes around the channel idents, an update for the website, and the arrival of HD content on iplayer. And we're looking hard at what works most effectively in terms of increasing awareness of the channel, bearing in mind the proportion of homes that currently have access to BBC HD. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/profile/?userid=1789431">Mike</a> has picked up on the references to "the BBC HD channel" - that is the way that presentation has been asked to reference BBC HD because we've found that it is the most effective way of making it clear that viewers do need to change channel to watch the programme in HD. There is a huge amount of confusion still - albeit not on this blog - around the HD viewing experience and we have found that simply telling people that a programme is "also available on BBC HD" doesn't always help them to find the HD version.  </p>

<p>The comments on encoders do not go unnoticed - rest assured wednesday83 and others - there is work underway but unfortunately going first down the path to HD does inevitably mean that later entrants can buy later generations of equipment, and it would not be best use of your licence fees to replace kit before it had served its useful life.  </p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/profile/?userid=3336990">Sue_Aitch</a> makes a good point about information on ceefax and red button help.  I've passed it on to the relevant people and I'm hopeful that it is something that can be fixed.</p>

<p>I hope this covers most points - I really have nothing further to say on the subject of DOGs.</p>

<p>All the best</p>

The BBC can't compete with Sky with its budgets, but it should nevertheless be trying its best to come as close as it can.<BR /><BR />I understand the problems with last minute scheduling and perhaps even availability of masters, but looking at ITV HD, whilst it is technically a much more inferior channel due to different transmission rates and the terrible red button (my opinion), the one thing they do seem able to do is get most major films on in HD.<BR /><BR />Its a shame the BBC don't seem able to do this as most films really shine in HD. The Pirates of the Caribean films I recorded over Christmas being good examples along with True Lies on ITV HD.<BR /><BR />At the moment BBC HD is mostly childrens programmes. Small children are the people least likely to get anything worthwile out of HD, I doubt the average 6 year old is going to be bothered about SD vs HD and programmes like the Nightgarden, simply leave most adults who look at the schedule feeling depressed.  <BR /><BR />Similarly David Attenbourough's programmes are simply depressing these days once you've tasted the likes of the excellent Brian Cox or Dr Iian Stewart who manage to make otherwise dry natural history or science subjects interesting through dynamic personality and interesting hands on demonstrations or on location interaction with wildlflife / terrain. Attenbourough is a great man but his style of boring montone narration has well and truly had his day.<BR /><BR />I also welcome the expansion to the schedule but now hope we'll see a corresponding expansion in HD film viewing, sport and adult targetted programming.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_301625"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77308550&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77308710"> <span class="comments_comment_number">4.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment4" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77308710#comment_77308710">19:34pm</a> on 16th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=13875023" class="comment_username_992133">heilanner</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>it's good news to see you're finally up to the 9 hours. the more hd the better. :)<BR /><BR />you said; I would welcome your feedback on how far predictability - for example of the kinds of programmes you can expect say on a Saturday evening...<BR /><BR />i'd say you should try to get Casualty in hd if it's possible, along with Dr Who (or whatever happens to be filling that slot at the time). can we also have the Strictly results show in hd too?</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_992133"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77308710&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77310817"> <span class="comments_comment_number">5.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment5" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77310817#comment_77310817">20:13pm</a> on 16th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=1279090" class="comment_username_222599">Briantist</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Here's an idea.<BR /><BR />Channel 4 have put into Ofcom to put an "overnight" timeshift Film4 HD on Freeview HD in 2012.<BR /><BR />How about allowing fellow public service broadcaster Film4 to use these "dead" hour to broadcast HD films, as the BBC HD channel can't.  <BR /><BR />Seems a shame to have all this bandwidth that could be used for timeshifted HD film viewing. <BR /><BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_222599"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77310817&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77317109"> <span class="comments_comment_number">6.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment6" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77317109#comment_77317109">22:17pm</a> on 16th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=2227952" class="comment_username_37917">Bill-Taylor</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Why no response to the lack of 5.1 sound?<BR /><BR />Encoders: Until the ones in use can be replaced why not increase the bandwidth to 19Mbps as in the trial?<BR /><BR />Not all negative: Number 1 Dectective Agency was a treat: Content, Picture and Sound.

At the same time on BBC HD we get a repeat of Hustle, a repeat of That Mitchell and Webb Look and Doctors. Since the BBC has shown no problems pushing Doctors back to the wee small hours why can't "Derailed" be shown simulcast on BBC HD?

When one compares things to a bit over a year ago and weekday schedules being three and a half or four hours this is a lot of progress. In 2009 it's been positive that a lot of more "minor" documentaries and nature programmes have been made in High Definition.<BR /><BR />My comments about promotion of the channel are that it is an ongoing process. Announcers should be writing into Danielle complaining saying that they are fed up of reading out pieces about "also in HD" :-). I would be interested if there is any BBC research to answer why Hustle is consistently the most popular rated programme on BBC HD. Whether it's scheduling, promotion of the viewers being most aware of HD. Using BARBs top ten ratings (sadly all I have to go on) I also find it quite bizarre how BBC HDs highest ratings outside of weekends seem to be at fairly late times in the evening. Also your top 10 ratings the last few weeks have been flooded by Sunday programmes (6 out of 10). Going back longer than a few weeks in the ratings this didn't happen before.  <BR /><BR />As for film content I agree. I'm not asking for a film service either. As has already been pointed out ITV HD and C4 HD show a lot more films than BBC HD does. For example I think it perfectly reasonable to have a decent film on every other Sunday. There have been some good things - Sin City, Wonder Boys, two of the first three Indiana Jones films and a lot more at Christmas. I think you've set the balance too far away from films, after all even BBC Three and Four show films from time to time.  <BR /><BR />Now that we're at 9hrs I wondered what happened looking ahead. Say in 2010 BBC HD theoretically managed to get hold of a F1 feed. Say for arguments sake it is for 16 races between March and October. Say also that you have Rugby, the occasional football match and things like Wimbledon. Say this means that just about every weekend through the late spring and summer it means you'd have to start the schedule at midday. What happens, do you ring up ofcom every week and beg to be allowed to do it as you can hardly say **every** sunday is a special event and exceptional circumstances? Do you get told no? Do you run out of money? What I'm getting at will you be lobbying ofcom for a rewriting of your license as 9hrs becomes unsustainable in such circumstances and to be blunt it's not very fair on the channel's budget if you getting money for 9hrs and going over it all the time.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_829407"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77337927&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77340908"> <span class="comments_comment_number">14.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment14" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77340908#comment_77340908">15:09pm</a> on 17th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=12904457" class="comment_username_223115">tagmclaren</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>I'm going to add my agreement some of the above comments.<BR /><BR />I dont want BBCHD to be a film channel but there a far too few shown at the moment.<BR /><BR />You say BBCHD is now doing everything it has been given permission to by the BBC trust.<BR /><BR />So, what is next?<BR /><BR />No change until analogue switch off and HD appears on terestrial TV?<BR /><BR />Or will there be a continuing growth of the service?</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_223115"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77340908&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77361621"> <span class="comments_comment_number">15.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment15" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77361621#comment_77361621">21:04pm</a> on 17th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=13876849" class="comment_username_">hdwatcher</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Yep BBC HD isn't there to be a film channel, there's already enough of those for film fans.

The 4.5mbps bitrate of BBC1 reduces the quality alot compared to say 8mbps so BBCHD wont have the bitrate reduced so will still look nicer.<BR /><BR />PLEASE air MOTD in HD, i'm almost certain that all premiership matches are recorded in HD so you wouldn't even need to buy the camera's for all the matches just buy the feeds and add your own audio. Just some studio camera's needed and thats done. Football is probably THE best thing that shows how glorious HD really is as mpeg2 SD cannot cope with multiple moving things on screen but h264 can.<BR /><BR />Please air less of the 5-10min jools holland performances that you air, they are on about twice a day on average.<BR /><BR />Please record and air ALL Horizon in HD, Panorama in HD would be great too:) Horizon looks great in HD especially that 1 about creating a star and next generation power creation.<BR /><BR />I like repeats myself but please only repeat recent shows that aired within the past 2 weeks, no more robin hood or planet earth for example.<BR /><BR />Was dissapointed that you didnt air the australian open mens or women's final in HD, neither live or re-aired:( Please could you air the men's final in HD as alot of us missed it, you only did 1 re-air of it a few hours after the final and the BBC2 airing didnt include the presentation ceremony so my recording is missing that too, was furious at the time, a full airing in HD with presentation ceremony would be magnificent:)<BR /><BR />i'm very happy you bought Damages, Mad Men, its a shame we cant broadcast in 24fps as those shows are shot in that are we use PAL speedup with makes movement look rather bad but not many uk people have 24fps compatible tv's so you're right to do so, my 24fps compatible tv cries though, would like to watch it in its original speed:(<BR /><BR />Please let us edit our comments on these blogs, we often make typo's or miss out words.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77369268&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77369681"> <span class="comments_comment_number">20.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment20" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77369681#comment_77369681">08:40am</a> on 18th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=12904457" class="comment_username_223115">tagmclaren</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>samuel1984,<BR /><BR />The PAL film speed up should have no obviously noticeable effect on motion.

Many people like films and films are ideally suited to HD as since the 1920's they've been shot in above HD resolution for the big screen. No-one expects a dedicated film channel but a couple of films per week on the BBC, with all films shown in HD would be nice. Over Christmas the BBC put some effort into it with Wallace and Grommit and it was welcome although some notable films eg Madagascor only made it only screens in SD. <BR /><BR />2. There appears to be some confusion with you over film speeds and there effects. Speeding the film up actually REDUCES motion blur not increases it. 24P is the most motion sensitive way of shooting footage. In fact its specifically used because it was the old film speed from year dot, and many directors like the blur it produces. Hence the label "film look". However, it does produce softness and motion blur when compared to 50P which is what is an ideal speed for sports. <BR /><BR />There are 2 things that can cause motion blur on your tv:<BR /><BR />a) Your tv itself - LCD's are prone to bluring despite what is said to the contrary. I've yet to see an LCD that doesn't blur footballers legs.<BR /><BR />b) Transmission compression rates also affect blurring. Thats why when you're encoding video there's a variable bit rate option. The point of variable bit rate is to allow lesser compression ie a higher bit rate in areas where there's a lot of motion. The less compression there is the better and less blurry the picture. This can be seen particularly well on ITV HD football matches. When the camera is still the grass on the pitch is razor sharp. The slightest pan, even ultra slowly and the grass blurs immediately.<BR /><BR />BTW Danielle, on the subject of compression, you said the BBC are aware of better compression equipment but can't justify changing the equipment when its only a couple of years old. Why don't you just sell the existing equipment to other broadcasters then use the money to upgrade to the better stuff? There must be tv companies all over the PAL world simply queueing up to get their hands on HD broadcast encoders second hand and as its only the broadcast encoder you'd have to change I'm kind of puzzled as to why it would be such a big deal especially as the LUXE TV experience shows that for non sports content you can actually save bandwidth and therefore money by reducing bit rate but increase quality at the same time. Surely the upgrade cost above the resale of the older equipment would pay for itself through bandwidth savings? In any case,even if not, its investment necessary to keep the BBC delivering a quality service and that has to be value for the tax payer in itself.<BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_301625"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77374100&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77381740"> <span class="comments_comment_number">23.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment23" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77381740#comment_77381740">12:25pm</a> on 18th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=3330657" class="comment_username_">psychemedia</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>As someone who receives BBC content through analogue and iplayer, but not digital broadcast (freeview, satellite), I was wondering whether there was an online (browser based) way for me to view red button content eg via iplayer?<BR /><BR />And if not, err, why not?</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77381740&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77382692"> <span class="comments_comment_number">24.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment24" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77382692#comment_77382692">12:39pm</a> on 18th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=13651115" class="comment_username_">samuel1984</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>I agree that we need to upgrade the encoders, i think its a poor excuse to say you want to use it to the maximum of it's lifespan to give us value for money.

Sell your old equipment on, there must be 100's of smaller tv companies that want to upgrade to tv and are waiting on 2nd hand equipment, i'll help you set up an ebay auction :PP<BR /><BR />This is a public funded company to provide for the wants and desires of the viewers and the viewers have stated they dont want a DOG, please listen to those who pay your wages instead of ignoring us.<BR /><BR />Also, how about you add 5.1 aac for the 1500bitrate bbc iplayer streams for shows that are broadcast in 5.1 on the BBCHD channel or atleast have an option for us to enable 5.1 as quite alot of us have 5.1 surround speakers connected to our computers.</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77382692&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77383628"> <span class="comments_comment_number">25.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment25" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77383628#comment_77383628">12:52pm</a> on 18th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=5354265" class="comment_username_829407">ropies</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>On the subject of encoders I never know why BBC staff get so ratty about it. You really will need better encoders in the future that's the only reason anybody comments on it. It's also a bit rich talking about having to invest in new equipment when if freeview HD is to ever take off hundreds of thousands of people will have to shell out for what is likely to be very expensive DVB-T2 equipment. As for the codecs only being a couple of years old, it's not age that is of primary importance, it's how good they are and they were already nothing special when they launched. If the BBC ones were as good as the tandberg ones down to about 10Mbs I'd be perfectly happy for you to be not in a hurry to replace them. Unfortunately they are nothing like as good as those and produce more artifacts and poorer detail on a bitrate that is usually 4-7Mbs higher.<BR /><BR />Anyway I don't have a problem with kids tv being on the schedules, they are after all the next generation and are most likely to appreciate the bright vivid colours of HD. I think the amount of time currently devoted to it would be more justified on an 18hr schedule though. </p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_829407"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77383628&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77384579"> <span class="comments_comment_number">26.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment26" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77384579#comment_77384579">13:05pm</a> on 18th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=6496545" class="comment_username_223021">daveac</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>@samuel1984 'Dont bother with the films, ITVHD show quite a few and sky have dedicated channels for hd movies, we can buy them on bluray too!'<BR /><BR />I can't agree with that statement.<BR /><BR />My Satbox (Pace) can't get ITVHD and although I love Blu-Ray I can't afford to buy a 1 or 2 films a week!<BR /><BR />As for SKY HD - FreeSat is supposted to be an alternate for those of us who can't afford or don't want to pay a monthly fee on top of our TV Licence.<BR /><BR />So let me say I wish there was at least 1 extra movie a week on BBCHD<BR /><BR />Cheers - and well done on moving to 9hours - daveac<BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_223021"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77384579&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77389980"> <span class="comments_comment_number">27.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment27" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77389980#comment_77389980">14:22pm</a> on 18th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=8520483" class="comment_username_259927">merseymal</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Personally, I'd rather see more films and programmes in HD than yet another BBC channel spending too much time showing sport</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_259927"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77389980&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77390568"> <span class="comments_comment_number">28.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment28" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77390568#comment_77390568">14:32pm</a> on 18th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=13768437" class="comment_username_231321">speedwayfan22</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Danielle Any news when we can expect to have Question time on a Thursday and the Big questions on a sunday shown on BBC HD.

This is ironic as on BBC HD there are advertisements of 'THE BEST OF THE BBC...EVEN GREATER IN HD'. This statement is false as the programmes shown are the second class programmes and very often repeats; that are not very popular in most cases. In fact, programmes like Merlin, Top Gear, Strictly Results, Eastenders, The Apprentice, and the F1 are not broadcast in HD, and these programmes are hits. Whereas, all that is broadcast are repeats and not worthwhile programmes.<BR />I would like to see more programmes synced with BBC One and Two in HD. As, about 3% of the BBC programmes that I watch are in HD and the rest are in SD. This is appalling as HD is the way forward and we are still left in this day and age broadcasting in SD, when we have a better service available, it just doesn’t make sense. <BR />I hope the BBC Trust releases a channel that is mirrored to either BBC 1,2,3,4 that broadcasts exactly the same programmes as the SD version as soon as possible, like Channel 4HD. But I hope they improve the content of the BBC HD Channel as soon as possible; as at the moment the channel is wasted.<BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77407122&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77411185"> <span class="comments_comment_number">34.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment34" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77411185#comment_77411185">21:01pm</a> on 18th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=13459039" class="comment_username_238245">sipasblog</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Great that you're up to 9 hours, and I'm finding more and more BBCHD pogrammes that I'm interested in.<BR /><BR />However...

It is bizarre that we will have to watch F1 on BBC1 whilst the HD channel is "wasted" running the preview loop.  I'm sure a version upscaled professionally and broadcast with the bandwidth of the HD channel using an MPEG4 codec would look miles (no pun intended) better than our domestic upscaling of the standard BBC1 signal via MPEG2.  The fact that F1 is, by it's very nature, fast moving (with lots of quick pans) will only exacerbate this.<BR /><BR />If Sky can do "Road Wars" in HD then why can't we have "The Apprentice" in HD ?  It's the same format - people running about with camcorders.  In fact, given that a lot of "Road Wars" happens at night, it should be much easier to film TA.  The boardroom would look great and we would no longer have to put up with the horrible moire effects we see on the skyscapers as the helicopter (for some unknown reason) flies around London's Docklands.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />Regards</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77522616&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77526918"> <span class="comments_comment_number">49.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment49" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77526918#comment_77526918">18:43pm</a> on 21st Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=13878228" class="comment_username_">high-def999</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>I really detest against the repetitive loop that is played during the day as the channel is definitely wasted.

If it were a set of simulcast channels, you wouldn't need to do any 'juggling', and neither would you lose audience who don't manage to switch over to the HD versions. It seems that most of the difficulties are of your / BBC Trust's own making.<BR /><BR />I guess one of the underlying reasons that simulcasting is unlikely to happen is the problem of what to do with regional variations. One hopes that eventually one can watch BBC1 HD / BBC2 HD (etc) (yes, even with upscaled content), dropping relatively seamlessly back to SD when regional variants come on air. The reason other channels do simulcasting, is because it's the right thing to do!!!  It will be interesting to see what the strategy will be when HD comes to terrestrial.<BR /><BR />I did actually rediscover BBC-HD last week and I recorded 'Yellowstone' in HD on Wednesday - brilliant photography, but marred by that damnable unwanted DOG. Yet another reason for not bothering to watch the BBC HD channel.<BR /><BR />Later today I will carry out an experiment, and see if the SD version of part two is any less enjoyable in SD than it will be in HD next Wednesday. If it's just as good - what's the point of HD? At least we'll be able to watch wolves without dogs.<BR /><BR />Perhaps if enough of us wrote directly to the BBC Trust airing our perfectly valid dislike of the distasteful DOG graffiti, someone might listen and rid us of it forever. Whether you have anything more to say about DOGs or not, is certainly not going to put a stop to the complaints. If you don't want to hear about DOGs, you know exactly what you need to do...<BR /><BR />The comment about Sky and movies was ridiculous. If you expect customers to go to Sky in order to watch HD films, why on earth did the BBC bother to create the FreeSat platform? We don't expect the BBC to provide a 'Movie Channel', but just to show the occasional movie in HD.<BR /><BR />May we ask when the BBC Trust is likely to next review the BBC HD channel?

I've seen things on BBCHD that in parts are shot in SD and compared them to the SD airing on BBC1/2 and the quality improvement is very big. Firstly freeview is 576i, 1080i can be encoded as 720p if you record it on your pc for example and as such would be progressive, the same thing would be true for when watching the upscaled sd, the quality would be better due to there would be more lines.<BR /><BR />Apprentice should be aired in HD, there's no excuse, you only need about 12 handcams and a handful of studio cameras for inside the house and in the boardroom. I'm sure if you ask Sir Alan he'd pay for them for you! Even using a £600 1080p camcorder with external mic would look pretty decent, obviously not as good as a studio camera but still more than watchable on BBCHD.<BR /><BR />It seems to me that the majority on things on BBCHD are things that can be sold to other countries like documentaries, scripted tv shows but shows like apprentice wouldn't be that popular outside of uk as sir alan isn't that well known outside of uk.<BR /><BR />Things that have great viewing figures and badly need HD are:<BR /><BR />Spooks, Match Of The Day, Apprentice, Formula 1, Top Gear. There are then shows that are wholely in studios which would be extremely cheap to film in HD like Mock The Week.<BR /><BR />Come on BBC listen to US the british public who pay your salaries, dont abuse your positions!</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77714172&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77727358"> <span class="comments_comment_number">65.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment65" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77727358#comment_77727358">10:31am</a> on 26th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=11880938" class="comment_username_899039">smithap66</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>A lot of people using a Humax HDR missed yesterdays Yellowstone when it failed to record.

A difference defined by the bandwidth given to the broadcast.<BR /><BR />I simply don't believe that, given many programmes are released on DVD at DVD quality, the picture quality is defined before the compression/bandwidth application stage.

BBC HD use 16 mbs whereas I believe LUXE TV use 8 mbs but have a far superior picture to  BBC HD. This is explained simply by the encoding quality as you pointed out. Whereas I don't know if LUXE's compression would stand up to sport and fast movement as most of their content is quite laid back in pace, it would nevertheless give the BBC a large headroom in which to increase the bit rate for fast actions programmes, films, sport.

It's just one type of material filmed in aparticular way which also makes it very consistent.<BR /><BR />Just curious, not being argumentative, if you watch a program like law and order on ITVHD, what in your opinion makes it far inferior?  One poster thinks that ALL other broadcasters are spot on with their HD quality compared tho the BBC.<BR /><BR />Also I do think a lot of people confuse the different looks of film, 25 psf and 50i video, the different production techniques,  and effects chosen by directors / production teams with good / bad transmission quality.

One poster thinks that ALL other broadcasters are spot on with their HD quality compared tho the BBC."<BR /><BR />You have me there in so far as I haven't watched Law and Order so can't comment specifically on that. I do find the higher bit rate of BBC HD shows through on many programmes though such as Earth Power of the Planet and Oceans. These for me and many others who commented on various forums seem to exceed anything put out by ITV for quality in HD although it is personal opinion. <BR /><BR />There are some side by side screen grabs of BBC HD vs ITV HD here on Snoods site, so I'll let you decide. To me the personally difference is clear in most programmes:<BR /><BR /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freesathd/page3/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/freesathd/page3/</a><BR /><BR />I also find ITV sport has a lot of artefacts in HD. Football looks great until you get the slightest movement from the camera and then the grass on the pitch blurs. This to me is far more noticeable than on BBC HD when they're showing Rugby for example.<BR /><BR />As for LUXE, I've never noticed any artefacts although I haven't watched a lot of LUXE just the odd half hour here and there. I'm not sure what you mean about the colours. Maybe you're saying they're overblown? To me they look natural. HD is very much more punchy than SD (I shoot HD myself so can definitely confirm that to be the case). If maybe it looks terrible on your tv, there are 3 possible causes: 1. Your TV naturally overblows colours (some cheaper LCD's do that), 2. Your tv isn't properly calibrated - shop settings on TV's and LCD's especially are often way over the top for saturation and contrast as they want them to look good in a heavily lit room - a THX calibration disc will cure that and provide a balanced setting, 3. It could just be that you prefer more traditionally muted colours in which case fair enough. Its each to their own on that one. To me the colours of the stills in Earth Power of the Planet - Mountains of the Monsoon were sublime and the best HD I've seen so far but they certainly jumped off the screen at you. BTW best ITV HD I've seen was the Piers Morgan programmes.<BR /></p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_301625"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77844416&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77848038"> <span class="comments_comment_number">88.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment88" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77848038#comment_77848038">10:57am</a> on 29th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=12904457" class="comment_username_223115">tagmclaren</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Don't get me wrong, I am firmly in the camp that beleives BBCHD is not as bad as some people say it is.<BR /><BR />Part of my point (also see Andys blog) was that some posters think that all other broadcasters are "spot on" with their PQ, which is not the case and they are optimised in different ways with different material.<BR /><BR />In my opinion ITVHD is generally very clean (too clean???) and sharp, not more detailed than BBC (remember there is a big difference between sharpness and resolution / detail) but in average material can show less macro blocking than BBC can do on the most demanding of material.<BR /><BR />Get up close on Lux and take a look for atifacts.

What a joke. Along similar lines I find it personally quite annoying that the nordic version of BBC HD runs on a tx in DVB-S2 when so many people are asking for us to have DVB-S2.<BR /><BR />I partially disagree about football on ITV HD. There's a lot variation in quality in football games (sadly) in high definition. One also has the issue of feeds and time of day KO which are both big issues. I think ITV HD performs better at football on average than BBC HD does taking into account the encoders and bitrate. BBC have had bad football matches including that infamous FA Cup Semi Final in 2008 they've also had fairly decent ones. Sadly there's been virtually no football in late 2008/2009 to do a fair comparison.<BR /><BR />As for encoders, again I've never advocated using 8Mbs. I find ofcom's plans for 8.4Mbs on freeview very concerning indeed and have commented on it. When anytime runs on about 9Mbs they run into problems. C4 has downed their bitrate and run into problems. I will say again for clarity, I would like the BBC to go along the lines of get DVB-S2, get much, much better codecs and aim to run them about 11-13Mbs and have 3 high definition channels. All these things I think are achievable in the next 2 or 3 years. Resisting ofcom's plans might also be a good idea. </p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_829407"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77854923&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class=" notables" id="comment_77856196"> <span class="comments_comment_number">94.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment94" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77856196#comment_77856196">14:36pm</a> on 29th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=8205870" class="comment_username_222507">Andy Quested</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Dear ropies<BR /><BR />DVB-S2 (and T2) are just modulation methods.  To put it crudely S2 just gets more "bits per MHz" of spectrum.  Moving S2 alone will not change the quality of a channel.  HD at 8Mbs does look very good but as I keep saying the toolset is far more important than the bit rate.<BR /><BR />Even at 60Mbs MPEG2 (i-frame) we see blocking and compression issues.  But with contribution codecs our main problem is latency, you can't have a two way discussion with a delay of more than 1 second really so we can't spend too long coding the signal.<BR /><BR />Emission coding allows us to use tools that just take time, 4-6 seconds at the moment.

If 2D had loads of spare capacity like some of the other Astra 28.2e satellites I would be quite happy staying on DVB-S for the forseeable future.

Doom9 I am not but then again neither is BBC HD. It's totally different to running a tv channel at 8Mbs **currently**. I see codecs improving so perhaps 8Mbs would be acceptable if other things allowed but I see no reason to see why AVC won't be just like things in coding history and take a good few more years to get really right (5 or 6 years from now). In anycase we're talking about a particular tv channel, BBC HD and I still think that with new encoders you should be aiming for 11-13Mbs based on what other people are doing. If you think my guestimates are very conservative and you can do better than that (for what people agree is an acceptable pq) I'd be very pleased to hear it in some blog later this year or next. Or perhaps you plan on a high bitrate than that with them in which case other people here will probably be very pleased and we can go back to arguing about the DOG until the end of time or even content :-).</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_829407"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77858898&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77863034"> <span class="comments_comment_number">98.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment98" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77863034#comment_77863034">17:31pm</a> on 29th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=13893382" class="comment_username_">ThreeplusFive</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p><BR />Danielle, I wish you choose you words with a little bit more care, I quote...<BR />“BBC HD is never going to be a movie channel - Sky movie services already do that very well”<BR /><BR />I find this comment very annoying as I have just left Sky TV because I can’t afford it.

I was merely pointing out that if it was exceeding current 16 mbs quality due to better encoding, then that would be one way the BBC could increase PQ and still have headroom to increase bit rate for sports and fast action movies without exceeding current bandwidths and thus costs.<BR /><BR />Heading forwards I'm for quality over anything else as I believe I made clear in one of my earlier posts (post 45).<BR /><BR />I still stand by my comments there. I personally think the BBC trust should set minimum bit rates based on the efficiency of the encoders used in order to set a minimimum PQ standard for channels on Freesat and that this should be suitably high to ensure that PQ is always of a high standard. I also acknowledged above this might lose one or two minor channels who didn't wan't to pay for the bandwidth required for a quality service but that given there were many quality channels queueing up to join who can't get slots, that I doubted this would be a problem and would actually benefit viewiers by increasing quality channel content over that provided by cheap channels.<BR /><BR />I think overall, Freesat really need to look at their positioning in the market place. <BR /><BR />Freesat might have started out as a project to provide tv to those who couldn't otherwise receive Freeview due to their geographical location, but since then, with bandwidth problems in Freeview and different programme content on Freesat, it has evolved into something much more, the future of UK TV. Whereas it might not want to market itself as the successor to Freeview just yet, given that Freeview is only just still rolling out, it should however I think to start to realise what it is, both an enthusiasts platform and a platform for non enthusiasts who nevertheless value quality of programming and picture quality over the standard of digital terrestrial offerings. I don't see why this can't sit alongside Freeview. Freeview being run of the mill and Freesat being the quality option in terms of picture quality. This allows each platform to grow in their own direction and ultimately when push does come to shove and most channels go HD leaving Freeview with no room to expand, then the switch to Freesat for all will be easy and justfiable as there will already a service which offers superior quality to Freeview without the bandwidth restrictions (I know Freesat is currently short of transponders but equally I know Astra are planning changes to capacity in the future so unlike Freeview which is boxed in by other services, Freesat can expand).</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_301625"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77863048&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>     <li class="" id="comment_77871744"> <span class="comments_comment_number">100.</span> <cite class="comments_user_info"> At <a class="time" name="comment100" href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?postId=77871744#comment_77871744">21:28pm</a> on 29th Mar 2009, <span class="vcard"><span class="fn"><a href="/blogs/profile.shtml?userid=12904457" class="comment_username_223115">tagmclaren</a></span></span> wrote: </cite> <div class="comment-text"><div>   <p>Alsone,<BR /><BR />Without being technically specific, the BBC trust actually have set down standards for BBCHD.  To quote<BR /><BR />"BBC HD should deliver a very high quality technical service to viewers, by adhering to, or seeking to exceed, industry standards for picture resolution. However, changes in this area by the BBC should take into account any need for consumers to upgrade their television equipment."<BR /><BR />Wriggle room in that statement of course! hehe :-)<BR /><BR />Don't want to take this  over as a technical thread so this should probably be in Andys blog, but seeing as PQ is obviously a hot topic...<BR /><BR />One thing Andy has mentioned that is very relevant when comparing BBC to Sky for example is stat muxing. (Sorry if this is preeching to the converted) <BR /><BR />Due to having more than one HD channel on a transponder they can allocate bit rate dynamically between the channels.  If the program on one channel has a lot of movement all of a sudden it can be allocated a higher rate whilst momentarily reducing the rate on the other channel(s).  The average total data rate however remains constant.  This allows Sky to zoom up to 20mbs when needed on demanding material.<BR /><BR />BBCHD doesn't have this luxery as there is only one HD channel.<BR /><BR />One question I do have for those with more sat knowledge is about how full the BBCHD transponder is?  What is it's max bitrate?<BR /><BR />With it carrying 2 SD channels, BBCHD and the associated sound it adds up to (unless I have misunderstood) circa 26 Mb/s.  There may also be additional data streams carried, I don't know MHEG, subtitles etc.<BR /><BR />Isn't that pretty close to its max capability anyway?  Is there actually any room to increase the BBCHD bitrate?<BR /><BR />I am sure the SD channels were placed on the transponder for good reason, so I assume they have to be there.<BR /><BR />Just curious</p>  </div></div> <div class="dna-comments-comment-footer"> <p class="flag comment_complain_223115"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/blog101/comments/UserComplaintPage?PostID=77871744&s_start=1" class="popup" target="_blank">Complain about this comment</a></p> </div> </li>    </ul>  <div class="ieclear">&nbsp;</div>   <div class="comments_pagination"> <div id="comment_pagination_page_status"> <p>Page 1 of 2</p> </div> <ul class="comments_pagination_ul">  <li class="comment_pagination_first_page_inactive">First </li>     <li class="comment_pagination_current_page">1 </li>    <li class="comment_pagination_pages"><a href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?module=comments&controller=index&action=index&siteName=blog101&forumId=movabletype101_64483&title=BBC+HD+Channel+Up+To+Nine+Hours+Per+Day&limit=100&listNamespace=movabletype101&parentUri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fblogs%2Fbbcinternet%2F2009%2F03%2Fhd_update_9_hours.html&filter=&preset=blog&postStyle=richtext&comments_page=2#dna-comments">2</a> </li>     <li class="comment_pagination_last_page_active"><a href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/03/hd_update_9_hours.html?module=comments&controller=index&action=index&siteName=blog101&forumId=movabletype101_64483&title=BBC+HD+Channel+Up+To+Nine+Hours+Per+Day&limit=100&listNamespace=movabletype101&parentUri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fblogs%2Fbbcinternet%2F2009%2F03%2Fhd_update_9_hours.html&filter=&preset=blog&postStyle=richtext&comments_page=2#dna-comments">Last</a> </li>  </ul> <div class="hidden dna-tab-loading loading"><img src="http://static.bbc.co.uk/modules/comments/1.9.4/img/loader.gif" alt="loading" /></div> <div style="clear: both"></div> </div>    </div>  </div> <div class="dna-comments-footer">  <p class="dna-commentbox-nocomments"> <span class="forumclosed">This entry is now closed for comments</span> </p>  </div> </div>
