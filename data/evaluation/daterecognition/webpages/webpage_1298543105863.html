Pradelles, was lost at sea CA. 1813/1814, and according to her legend,
was a victim of Lafitte pirates. T. D. Owings was born into the
colonial middle to upper class society, who inhabited a series of
2-story mansions, such as Sherwood or Bellefield; owned many slaves,
and generally relied on tobacco culture for export to England. Although
not heretofore mentioned, the Owings children are believed to have been
educated by private tutors.<sup><span

 face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">Other than tobacco farms,
Cockeysville was also surrounded by several deposits of iron ore,
probably hematite of about 50% purity, as well as of marble and
limestone , which eventually accounted for many small quarries. By 1774
the North Hampton iron furnace was already producing pig iron, later
supplying cannon balls and canister shot used by the Continental Army.
Thomas&#8217; father, many of his uncles, and his future brother-in-law, the
French Lieutenant Benedict Van Pradelles, were all veterans of the
American Revolution, some of them present at the Battle of Yorktown.
Hence, it was probably the fortunes of the North Hampton iron furnace,
which created Capt. John C. Owings&#8217; interest in iron-smelting in
Kentucky.<sup><span

Cockey Owings became so interested in territorial Kentucky property,

one of J. C. Owing&#8217;s partners and governor of </font></span><span

 face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">Kentucky</font></span><span
 style="font-family: Verdana;"><font
 face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">, is one possibility.
Another possibility was Jacob Meyers, who in 1782 acquired a
10,000-acre tract of </font></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><font
 face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">Kentucky land, which
patent was signed by Virginia Gov. Patrick Henry, and Meyers began
building the Slate Creek iron mill (later the Bourbon iron furnace) in
1787. During the late 1780s, John Cockey Owings began making
significant land purchases in present-day Bourbon and Bath counties,
Kentucky, which eventually included the Meyers tract, and may have
reached a total of 25,000 acres. The writer believes that John C.
Owings engaged his future son-in-law, Benedict Van Pradelles, to
oversee his property in Kentucky, and David Owings reported to the
writer that in 1790 Van Pradelles advertised in the Lexington Gazette
for recovery of a lost pocketbook, which contained papers written in
French. In 1790 Van Pradelles married Owings&#8217; oldest daughter Cassandra
and left immediately for France.<sup><span

Owings Mason, acknowledges that T. D. Owings had a first marriage to ??
(given name unknown) Jackson, who died CA. 1801 and who in 1800, gave
birth to a son, Thomas Jackson Owings, who died in 1830. &#8220;Owings and
Allied Families,&#8221; by A. D. an E. S. Owings, refer to Jackson Owings&#8217;
birth as a &#8220;natural son,&#8221; presumably meaning illegitimate. However,

the sixth year of Washington&#8217;s presidency. About 1805 Frances Owings
Taylor wrote of a house selling for &#8220;2,900 pounds of tobacco,&#8221; so
perhaps tobacco rather than the British pound, had become the medium of
exchange. T. D. Owings complained about pains and injuries to his
health, as did Van Pradelles in 1798 about Owings&#8217; health.<sup><span

Jacob Meyers. It was later bought and operated by a syndicate headed by
John Cockey Owings, for whom Owingsville is named. This furnace was
built just 16 years after the building of Boonesboro. A fort was
constructed for the protection of workers (and manned by 17 Kentucky
militiamen). At least one of the early iron workers was killed by
hostile (Shawnee) Indians. Incidentally it was the iron furnace, which
furnished cannon balls and canister shot used by Andrew Jackson at the

the Bourbon furnace was located on a 10,000 acre land grant from Gov.
Patrick Henry to Jacob Meyers, but in 1791 became a joint stock company
headed by John Cockey Owings. It was the first iron-smelting operation
built west of Allegheny Mountains. The furnace first began to make
10-gallon pots for boiling out salt at the Salt Lick Springs, but the
pioneer needs soon forced the owners to make cut nails, pots and other
cooking utensils, horse shoes, axe blades, hoes, stoves, plow shares,
pig iron and bar iron.<sup><span

located at Howard Hills and Black Horse Banks, about 2 miles from the
furnace, and 3 tons of ore, pulled by oxen, were needed to produce 1
ton of pig iron. Products, which included cannon balls and canister
shot, were hauled over the Iron Furnace Pike to Frankfurt on Kentucky

year that the new Owings mansion in Owingsville was completed, the T.
D. Owings family lived in a stone house. The new 3-story brick building
took 3 years to complete. The mansion was involved in a competition
between Owings and Richard Menefee to see which man could complete his
home the quickest, and thus has the town of Owingsville named after
him. However, other sources state that the town was named much earlier
for Owings&#8217; father. </font></span></p>

indeed pleasing in appearance, and included kitchen, servants&#8217;

design and build the residence, using hand-carved woodwork and mantels,
made from black walnut wood. There was a wide hall in the center of the
building from whence a spiral staircase, made of mahogany, was built up
to the third floor. The stairway was built in Baltimore, and its parts
were hauled across the mountains to Owingsville in ox carts. In 1813
the staircase had cost $10,000, and the entire mansion had cost
$60,000, a magnificent sum in that age.&nbsp; Owings invited everyone
to the house warming, and afterward all the political elite of Kentucky
passed through its portals.<sup><span

in Thomas D. Owings&#8217; life occurred in 1814, when Owings was on a visit
to Baltimore and he met Louis Phillipe of France, the son of the Duke
of Orleans. Louis Phillipe, although he had been a successful general
under Napoleon, had been exiled in 1813 because of a suspected plot
against the republic. Owings invited the dapper French aristocrat to
visit his home in Kentucky. According to family records, Louis Phillipe
remained Owings&#8217; guest from July 17, 1814 until July 22, 1815, after
which the French nobleman returned to France and reclaimed his estates.
Replacing King Charles X on the throne, Louis Phillipe was crowned
&#8220;King of the French,&#8221; following a revolution in 1830. He remained on
the throne until 1848, when another liberal revolution toppled him, and
he fled in exile to England.<sup><span

variety of merchandise, including groceries, clothing, cotton and wool
yard goods, utensils, dinnerware, and other household and farm hardware
needed on the frontier. Also, lawsuits began accumulating against him,

managed the Bourbon furnace, and had accumulated 15,000 pounds in debts,<sup><span

that Owings had agreed to purchase a half-interest in the Red River

pounds. Many years after the Beall lawsuit was filed and Beall was
already deceased, his heirs obtained a judgment against Owings, but by
that time the latter&#8217;s assets had been exhausted, and he had declared
bankruptcy.<sup><span

Since Nicholas was already dead, the bond had apparently been passed
along to one of his heirs, and Jefferson and his associates hoped to
collect it. It is doubtful if Clay took any action since T. D. Owings
was a close friend, whose home he often visited. Even so, by 1822
Owings had already lost all of his fortune, and a lawsuit could only
have awarded a judgment to the plaintiff.<sup><span

survives about T. D. Owings between 1822 and 1836. His youngest
daughter, Ann Eliza Owings (Mason) was born in Owingsville in 1822, and
Owings&#8217; wife, Mary Nicholas Owings, died on Aug. 9, 1825; and Owings
never remarried. The Grand Lodge AF&amp;AM of Kentucky has advised me
by email that Thomas Deye Owings was recorded as a Master Mason for
1821-1822 in the Proceedings of the now defunct Owingsville Webb Lodge
55. However, the facade of the Masonic building in Owingsville bears
the notation: &#8220;Bath Lodge #55, AF&amp;AM, 1819-1921.<sup><span

1823, when he was elected state senator and served until 1827. In 1822,
Owings also lost the Bourbon iron furnace, which was sold by court
order to Robert Wickliff of Lexington, who in turn sold the furnace to
Major John Calvin Mason, who in 1847 would become Owings&#8217; son-in-law,
following his marriage to Ann Eliza Owings. Mason kept the furnace at
full blast until Aug. 1838, when it was shut down and abandoned after
47 years of operation.<sup><span

 href="#24">24</a></span></sup>&nbsp;It seems logical that Owings
quickly established a close relationship, perhaps even a working
relationship, with John C. Mason, which eventually led to his marriage
to Owings&#8217; daughter. T. D. Owings began one more business venture in
iron-smelting in 1829, when he built the Estill furnace on Miller
Creek. After a short time, he sold the Estill iron smelter to Resin H.
Gist and James Mason, and the Estill furnace was operated by them and
others until 1879.<sup><span

that Stephen F. Austin of Texas had at least a passing acquaintance
with Thomas D. Owings, although the first offer for Kentucky troops
passed from Owings to Austin. By Nov. 1835, solicitations for troops to
fight in the Texas Revolution against Mexico were published up and down
the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys from New Orleans to Cincinnati,
and Owings may simply have responded to that request. By 1798 Austin
was living at the lead mines in Missouri, and since Austin graduated
from Transylvania College and remained in Lexington, Kentucky, until
1810, the probability is great that the two men first met at that
point. A few extracts from Austin&#8217;s letter to T. D. Owings, dated New
Orleans, Jan. 18, 1836, follow:</font></span></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Verdana;">On Feb. 16, 1836 Austin, while
soliciting in Nashville, Tennessee, wrote a letter to his cousin, Mary
Austin Holley, that Col. T. D. Owings was en route from Kentucky with a
regiment of troops for the Texas Army.<sup><span

 href="#32">32</a></span></sup>&nbsp;On March 27, 1836 (the same day
that 75 of his Kentuckians, about one-quarter of Col. James Fannin&#8217;s
ill-fated army, were massacred at Goliad) Samuel M. Williams, Austin&#8217;s
secretary at San Felipe, wrote from New Orleans that: &#8220;...Col. Owings
is on the march with 1,400 men, left Maysville on March 12<sup>th</sup>,
is armed principally with U. S. Yagers (muskets)...&#8221;<sup><span

 href="#33">33</a></span></sup>&nbsp;In April, 1836, William Bryan,
purchasing agent for Texas, wrote President D. G. Burnett that: &#8220;...the
$5,000 in the bank for Col. Owings has been used by us,.. Not one
dollar of means is now left... and the result will be that Col. Owings
will lose the large amount he has expended on us...&#8221;<sup><span

 href="#34">34</a></span></sup>&nbsp;From the last letter, it appeared
likely the Thomas D. Owings personally paid for the recruitment, arming
and transportation for his Kentucky troops with no monetary
remuneration from the Republic of Texas. And because of the quick
termination of the war, many of Owings troops never experienced any
military action. However he later was awarded 4 land grants from the
State of Texas, which was probably intended as reimbursement for his
expenses during the Revolution. Also Thomas D. Owings drew as sole heir
the last pay of his massacred son, Robert S. Owings, although the
latter&#8217;s name was garbled either as Robert G. Owings or Charles Robert
Owings in the Revolutionary records.<sup><span
 style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 255); position: relative; top: -2pt;"><a
 href="#35">35</a></span></sup></span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Verdana;">Thomas Deye Owings never returned to
Kentucky to live, except possibly for a couple visits, after 1836, and
the last sixteen years of his life again are marked by extensive
obscurity. Also, why he chose Brenham, Texas as a place to live is also
marked with mystery. In 1838 it was a very sparsely-populated rural
community known as Hickory Grove, when it changed its named to Brenham
in 1843, and in 1844 became the county seat of Washington County. T. D.
Owings lived to have two more of his sons predecease him, the first
being Thomas Cockey Deye Owings, who died there in October, 1837, still
single. The second son was John Cockey Owings, who also fought during
the Texas Revolution, and died at Brenham in July, 1847, also still
single. They were the first members of the Owings family to be buried
in the Old Masonic Cemetery in Brenham.<sup><span

 href="#36">36</a></span></sup></span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify;"><span
 style="font-family: Verdana;">During the sixteen or seventeen years of
Thomas D. Owings residence in Texas, it would appear that he was
neither penniless nor enduring poverty. He was apparently involved
considerably in land speculation, and other than his land grants from
the State of Texas, he purchased ten tracts of land from private
sources.<sup><span
 style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; color: rgb(51, 102, 255); position: relative; top: -2pt;"><a

it would probably divulge a considerable list of land sales. Also a
check with the Texas State Library and Archives in Austin reveals that
the following original documents survive in that facility, as follows: </span></p>

County, Texas census was enumerated, Thomas D. Owings was recorded at
residence 200, page 299-A, living in the household of Rebecca and A. G.
Compton, who was a Brenham merchant with $8,000 of assets. Perhaps
Owings was away at census time, and Mrs. Compton reported several
incorrect items. T. D. Owings was listed as being born in Texas rather
than Maryland; no assets for him were reported, and the census listed
his age as 65 when in fact he was actually age 75.<sup><span

reported that Owings died in his home on October 6, 1853, so most
likely he allowed the Compton family to live in his home, in return for
cooking and care during his geriatric years. T. D. Owings was age 78 at
the time of his death, and he was the third Owings family member to be
buried in the Old Masonic Cemetery.<sup><span

Bourbon iron furnace. He served in the Kentucky House of
Representatives for 2 terms. In 1846 he enlisted during the Mexican War

Democratic National Convention in Charleston in 1860. When Mason found
himself so close to the Ohio River while living in a slave state in
1861, he moved his family to Brenham, Texas. Already age 60, Mason
served the Confederacy in the Brenham Graybeards of the Texas State
Troops in 1863. In 1864 his wife Ann Eliza Mason died, leaving a
houseful of infants and children, and she was the last Owings family
member to be buried in Brenham. Mason died aboard a steamship at New
Orleans in 1865, and Kentucky brought his remains back to the State
Cemetery in Frankfurt. Afterward, their oldest daughter brought her
siblings back to Kentucky to live.<sup><span
