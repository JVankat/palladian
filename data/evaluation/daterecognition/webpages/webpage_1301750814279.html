&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   <b>MELBOURNE </b>&#151; Calling a Knothole game because of darkness just got a little more difficult in Campbell County. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Tuesday, the county Planning and Zoning Commission gave the Campbell County Knothole Association permission to install lights at four of eight baseball fields at Pendery Park, a 72-acre baseball and soccer complex on Ky. 8 near Melbourne. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &#147;The lighting capacity is going to double the capacity of the existing play area,&#148; county director of planning and zoning Peter Klear said Wednesday. &#147;We're not going to add double the people, we're just going to expand the time it's used.&#148; <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Mr. Klear said the plan is to have the lights in place this summer. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Mike Combs, district supervisor for the Knothole association, said the lights will cost about $345,000. His organization is seeking about $250,000 in donations, with the Campbell County Fiscal Court kicking in the other $95,000. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &#147;Including in-kind contributions, we're about $140,000 into it,&#148; Mr. Combs said. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Pendery Park opened in 1997. The Knothole association, which serves about 1,500 players a year, is five years into a 20-year lease with the county. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   The association built and maintains the fields. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   In addition to Knothole, the fields are used by the Silver Grove High School baseball team during the school year and by summer leagues consisting of players from Bishop Brossart and Campbell County high schools. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Mr. Combs said the lights are part of a multiphase renovation. Plans call for: a 10-stall batting cage; four shelters, including a two-story structure with a meeting room; another concession building; turning one existing field into a four-field T-ball complex; and a flag memorial site. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   &#147;Kids have a place to play,&#148; Mr. Combs said. &#147;Now they'll have a (nicer) place to play.&#148;<br>  <p>
