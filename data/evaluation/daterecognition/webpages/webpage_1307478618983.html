The AIAA tells me that they have more than 1,000 participants. Interest in attending is very high. Last night Sean O'Keefe got a farewell from the assembled attendees tonight at a reception in a gigantic tent erected to hold the exhibits.  More tomorrow from the meeting itself.<P>This meeting will also be webcast - go <a href="http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=533">here</a> for an agenda and a link for the webcast.<P><B>Update:</B> Sean O'Keefe told the audience this morning that the President's FY 2006 budget, to be released on 7 February,  would contain a budget increase, rare among agencies funded under discretionary spending, that would continue the Adminstration's committment to providing the resources required to implement the President's Vision for Space Exploration.</p>

Yet their mention by NASA on Thursday made few if any news reports.<P>For example, Florida Today made <a href="http://www.floridatoday.com/!NEWSROOM/spacestoryMAIN0128MEMORIAL.htm">no mention</a> of these others who died. I find it hard to understand why these others were not mentioned given that their faces and names were featured to the same extent as were those of the Apollo 1, Challenger, and Columbia crews during an event televised from NASA Headquarters. Indeed, if you read the memo sent out across NASA, the word 'astronaut' does not even appear. Instead <i>"NASA employees"</i> is used:</p>

In other instances, technological and other barriers have thus far prevented the kind of progress CAIB had hoped for, and NASA has striven for. Taken together, the RTF TG believes it is entirely possible NASA will be able to make sufficient progress on the CAIB recommendations before their current launch date. Several activities will nonetheless be incomplete, and several issues raised by the CAIB, such as scheduling and resources, are timeless."</i></p>

Apparently not: They only sent this media advisory out with 4 days advance notice (2 of which are on a weekend).  Also, with 5,200 students participating in a  NASA event, you'd think that NASA's Education Office would be heavily promoting this event. Again, the answer is no. The last "news" on the Education <a href="http://education.nasa.gov/home/index.html">website</a> at NASA HQ is dated 15 Jan 2005. No mention is made of this event.<P>Oh yes, then there is this new solicitation:<P><a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=15242">NASA Solicitation: Seeking Collaboration to Conduct Student Competition to Name the Node 2 Element of the International Space Station</a><P> <i>"NASA seeks an unfunded collaboration with a commercial or non-profit organization to define, organize and execute a nationwide project-oriented competition for K-12 students in U.S. schools to select a name for the Node 2 element of the International Space Station (ISS) to be launched on a future Space Shuttle flight."</i><P>There is no mention of this national education project on the Education website either.<P>And then there are these College-level education awards announced today as well:<P><a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=15998">NASA Funds Work-Force Development Projects to Support Vision</a><P><i>"NASA has selected 32 consortia in the National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program.

It is hard to imagine how you are going to excite students - and educators - when so many people at NASA PAO and its Education office are asleep at the wheel.</p>

No mention whatsoever is made of the ESA Huygens landing on Titan earlier today - an event people marked on their calendars years ago. This landing is part of the NASA Cassini mission with many U.S. collaborators - an astounding achievement which has NASA and ESA websites jammed with people trying to download images.<P>Oh by the way - they also seem to have forgotten another important 14 January event - i.e. the announcement of the President's space vision on 14 January 2004. They recall one anniversary of comparatively minor importance but ignore the anniversary of an event that has changed the entire agency's course and was the subject of incredible legislative activity last year.<P>Are they asleep in Code L?

To maintain the power balance, the two MCCs agreed to power down the Vozduhk CO2 scrubber and use the CDRA (carbon dioxide removal assembly) instead, thus reducing the stress on the Russian power system. In addition, pressurized element shell heaters will be turned off and manually managed by ground controllers if they begin to approach the maximum allowable 12.2 kW (action would be taken around 11.9 kW).

Either the folks on this "list" took themselves out of consideration or they were never being considered in the first place.  Given Sean O'Keefe's planned departure in February, and the Bush Administration's penchant for filling positions quickly, and the release of a new budget in a few weeks, one can expect that something will emerge rather soon.  Given another habit, i.e. that this White House keeps things under wraps until they chose the right moment, the identity of their choice will likely emerge only a short time before an official announcement.</p>
