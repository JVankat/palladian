<p align="right"></b>New Delhi, July 24, 1991.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>

<p>POLICY OBJECTIVES</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundations of modern India. His
vision and determination have left a lasting impression on every facet of national
endeavour since Independence. It is due to his initiative that India now has a strong and
diversified industrial base and is a major industrial nation of the world. The goals and
objectives set out for the nation by Pandit Nehru on the eve of Independence, namely, the
rapid agricultural and industrial development of our country, rapid expansion of
opportunities for gainful employment, progressive reduction of social and economic
disparities, removal of poverty and attainment of self-reliance remain as valid today as
at the time Pandit Nehru first set them out before the nation. Any industrial policy must
contribute to the realisation of these goals and objectives at an accelerated pace. The
present statement of industrial policy is inspired by these very concerns, and represents
a renewed initiative towards consolidating the gains of national reconstruction at this
crucial stage.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1948, immediately after Independence,
Government introduced the Industrial Policy Resolution. This outlined the approach to
industrial growth and development. It emphasised the importance to the economy of securing
a continuous increase in production and ensuring its equitable distribution. After the
adoption of the Constitution and the socio-economic goals, the Industrial Policy was
comprehensively revised and adopted in 1956. To meet new challenges, from time to time, it
was modified through statements in 1973, 1977 and 1980.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 was followed by the
Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 which had as its objective the acceleration of the
rate of economic growth and the speeding up of industrialisation as a means of achieving a
socialist pattern of society. In 1956, capital was scarce and the base of entrepreneurship
not strong enough. Hence, the 1956 Industrial Policy Resolution gave primacy to the role
of the State to assume a predominant and direct responsibility for industrial development.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. The Industrial Policy statement of 1973, inter alia, identified
high-priority industries where investment from large industrial houses and foreign
companies would be permitted.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. The Industrial Policy Statement of 1977 laid emphasis on
decentralisation and on the role of small-scale, tiny and cottage industries.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. The Industrial Policy Statement of 1980 focussed attention on the
need for promoting competition in the domestic market, technological upgradation and
modernisation. The policy laid the foundation for an increasingly competitive export based
and for encouraging foreign investment in high-technology areas. This found expression in
the Sixth Five Year Plan which bore the distinct stamp of Smt. Indira Gandhi. It was Smt.
Indira Gandhi who emphasised the need for productivity to be the central concern in all
economic and production activities.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7. These policies created a climate for rapid industrial growth in the
country. Thus on the eve of the Seventh Five Year Plan, a broad-based infrastructure had
been built up. Basic industries had been established. A high degree of self-reliance in a
large number of items - raw materials, intermediates, finished goods - had been achieved.
New growth centres of industrial activity had emerged, as had a new generation of
entrepreneurs. A large number of engineers, technicians and skilled workers had also been
trained.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8. The Seventh Plan recognised the need to consolidate on these
strengths and to take initiatives to prepare Indian industry to respond effectively to the
emerging challenges. A number of policy and procedural changes were introduced in 1985 and
1986 under the leadership of Shri Rajiv Gandhi aimed at increasing productivity, reducing
costs and improving quality. The accent was on opening the domestic market to increased
competition and readying our industry to stand on its own in the face of international
competition. The public sector was freed from a number of constraints and given a larger
measure of autonomy. The technological and managerial modernisation of industry was
pursued as the key instrument for increasing productivity and improving our
competitiveness in the world. The net result of all these changes was that Indian industry
grew by an impressive average annual growth rate of 8.5% in the Seventh Plan period.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9. Government is pledged to launching a reinvigorated struggle for
social and economic justice, to end poverty and unemployment and to build a modern,
democratic, socialist, prosperous and forward-looking India. Such a society can be built
if India grows as part of the world economy and not in isolation.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10. While Government will continue to follow the policy of
self-reliance, there would be greater emphasis placed on building up our ability to pay
for imports through our own foreign exchange earnings. Government is also committed to
development and utilisation of indigenous capabilities in technology and manufacturing as
well as its upgradation to world standards.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11. Government will continue to pursue a sound policy framework
encompassing encouragement of entrepreneurship, development of indigenous technology
through investment in research and development, bringing in new technology, dismantling of
the regulatory system, development of the capital markets and increasing competitiveness
for the benefit of the common man. The spread of industrialisation to backward areas of
the country will be actively promoted through appropriate incentives, institutions and
infrastructure investments.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12. Government will provide enhanced support to the small-scale sector
so that it flourishes in an environment of economic efficiency and continuous
technological upgradation.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13. Foreign investment and technology collaboration will be welcomed to
obtain higher technology, to increase exports and to expand the production base.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">14. Government will endeavour to abolish the monopoly of any sector or
any individual enterprise in any field of manufacture, except on strategic or military
considerations and open all manufacturing activity to competition.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15. The Government will ensure that the public sector plays its
rightful role in the evolving socio-economic scenario of the country. Government will
ensure that the public sector is run on business lines as envisaged in the Industrial
Policy Resolution of 1956 and would continue to innovate and lead in strategic areas of
national importance. In the 1950s and 1960s, the principal instrument for controlling the
commanding heights of the economy was investment in the capital of key industries. Today,
the State has other instruments of intervention, particularly fiscal and monetary
instruments. The State also commands the bulk of the nation's savings. Banks and financial
institutions are under State control. Where State intervention is necessary, these
instruments will prove more effective and decisive.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">16. Government will fully protect the interests of labour, enhance
their welfare and equip them in all respects to deal with the inevitability of
technological change. Government believes that no small section of society can corner the
gains of growth, leaving workers to bear its pains. Labour will be made an equal partner
in progress and prosperity. Workers' participation in management will be promoted. Workers
cooperatives will be encouraged to participate in packages designed to turn around sick
companies. Intensive training, skill development and upgradation programmes will be
launched.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">17. Government will continue to visualise new horizons. The major
objectives of the new industrial policy package will be to build on the gains already
made, correct the distortions or weaknesses that may have crept in, maintain a sustained
growth in productivity and gainful employment and attain international competitiveness.
The pursuit of these objectives will be tempered by the need to preserve the environment
and ensure the efficient use of available resources. All sector of industry whether small,
medium or large, belonging to the public, private or cooperative sector will be encouraged
to grow and improve on their past performance.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">18. Government's policy will be continuity with change.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">19. In pursuit of the above objectives, Government have decided to take
a series of initiatives in respect of the policies relating to the following areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A package for the Small and Tiny Sectors of industry is being announced
separately.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>INDUSTRIAL LICENSING POLICY</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">20. Industrial Licensing is governed by the Industries (Development
&amp; Regulation) Act, 1951. The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 identified the
following three categories of industries: those that would be reserved for development in
public sector, those that would be permitted for development through private enterprise
with or without State participation, and those in which investment initiatives would
ordinarily emanate from private entrepreneurs. Over the years, keeping in view the
changing industrial scene in the country, the policy has undergone modifications.
Industrial licensing policy and procedures have also been liberalised from time to time. A
full realisation of the industrial potential of the country calls for a continuation of
this process of change.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">21. In order to achieve the objectives of the strategy for the
industrial sector for the 1990s and beyond it is necessary to make a number of changes in
the system of industrial approvals. Major policy initiatives and procedural reforms are
called for in order to actively encourage and assist Indian entrepreneurs to exploit and
meet the emerging domestic and global opportunities and challenges. The bedrock of any
such package of measures must be to let the entrepreneurs make investment decisions on the
basis of their own commercial judgement. The attainment of technological dynamism and
international competitiveness requires that enterprises must be enabled to swiftly respond
to fast changing external conditions that have become characteristic of today's industrial
world. Government policy and procedures must be geared to assisting entrepreneurs in their
efforts. This can be done only if the role played by the government were to be changed
from that of only exercising control to one of providing help and guidance by making
essential procedures fully transparent and by eliminating delays.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">22. The winds of change have been with us for some time. The industrial
licensing system has been gradually moving away from the concept of capacity licensing.
The system of reservations for public sector undertakings has been evolving towards an
ethos of greater flexibility and private sector enterprise has been gradually allowed to
enter into many of these areas on a case by case basis. Further impetus must be provided
to these changes which alone can push this country towards the attainment of its
entrepreneurial and industrial potential. This calls for bold and imaginative decisions
designed to remove restraints on capacity creation, while at the same, ensuring that
over-riding national interests are not jeopardised.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">23. In the above context, industrial licensing will henceforth be
abolished for all industries, except those specified, irrespective of levels of
investment. These specified industries (Annex-II), will continue to be subject to
compulsory licensing for reasons related to security and strategic concerns, social
reasons, problems related to safety and over-riding environmental issues, manufacture of
products of hazardous nature and articles of elitist consumption. The exemption from
licensing will be particularly helpful to the many dynamic small and medium entrepreneurs
who have been unnecessarily hampered by the licensing system. As a whole the Indian
economy will benefit by becoming more competitive, more efficient and modern and will take
its rightful place in the world of industrial progress.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOREIGN INVESTMENT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">24. While freeing Indian industry from official controls, opportunities
for promoting foreign investments in India should also be fully exploited. In view of the
significant development of India's industrial economy in the last 40 years, the general
resilience, size and level of sophistication achieved, and the significant changes that
have also taken place in the world industrial economy, the relationship between domestic
and foreign industry needs to be much more dynamic than it has been in the past in terms
of both technology and investment. Foreign investment would bring attendant advantages of
technology transfer, marketing expertise, introduction of modern managerial techniques and
new possibilities for promotion of exports. This is particularly necessary in the changing
global scenario of industrial and economic cooperation marked by mobility of capital. The
government will therefore welcome foreign investment which is in the interest of the
country's industrial development.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">25. In order to invite foreign investment in high priority industries,
requiring large investments and advanced technology, it has been decided to provide
approval for direct foreign investment upto 51% foreign equity in such industries. There
shall be no bottlenecks of any kind in this process. This group of industries has
generally been known as the &quot;Appendix I Industries&quot; and are areas in which FERA
companies have already been allowed to invest on a discretionary basis. This change will
go a long way in making Indian policy on foreign investment transparent. Such a framework
will make it attractive for companies abroad to invest in India.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">26. Promotion of exports of Indian products calls for a systematic
exploration of world markets possible only through intensive and highly professional
marketing activities. To the extent that expertise of this nature is not well developed so
far in India, Government will encourage foreign trading companies to assist us in our
export activities. Attraction of substantial investment and access to high technology,
often closely held, and to world markets, involves interaction with some of the world's
largest international manufacturing and marketing firms. The Government will appoint a
special board to negotiate with such firms so that we can engage in purposive negotiation
with such large firms, and provide the avenues for large investments in the development of
industries and technology in the national interest.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">27. There is a great need for promoting an industrial environment where
the acquisition of technological capability receives priority. In the fast changing world
of technology the relationship between the suppliers and users of technology must be a
continuous one. Such a relationship becomes difficult to achieve when the approval process
includes unnecessary governmental interference on a case to case basis involving endemic
delays and fostering uncertainty. The Indian entrepreneur has now come of age so that he
no longer needs such bureaucratic clearances of his commercial technology relationships
with foreign technology suppliers. Indian industry can scarcely be competitive with the
rest of the world if it is to operate within such a regulatory environment.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">28. With a view to injecting the desired level of technological
dynamism in Indian industry, Government will provide automatic approval for technology
agreement related to high priority industries within specified parameters. Similar
facilities will be available for other industries as well if such agreements do not
require the expenditure of free exchange. Indian companies will be free to negotiate the
terms of technology transfer with their foreign counterparts according to their own
commercial judgement. The predictability and independence of action that this measure is
providing to Indian industry will induce them to develop indigenous competence for the
efficient absorption of foreign technology. Greater competitive pressure will also induce
our industry to invest much more in research and development and they have been doing in
the past. In order to help this process, the hiring of foreign technicians and foreign
testing of indigenously developed technologies, will also not require prior clearance as
prescribed so far, individually or as a part of industrial or investment approvals.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>PUBLIC SECTOR POLICY</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">29. The public sector has been central to our philosophy of
development. In the pursuit of our development objectives, public ownership and control in
critical sector of the economy has played an important role in preventing the
concentration of economic power, reducing regional disparities and ensuring that planned
development serves the common good.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">30. The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 gave the public sector a
strategic role in the economy. Massive investments have been made over the past four
decades to build a public sector which has a commanding role in the economy. Today key
sectors of the economy are dominated by mature public enterprises that have successfully
expanded production, opened up new areas of technology and built up a reserve of technical
competence in a number of areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">31. After the initial exuberance of the public sector entering new
areas of industrial and technical competence, a number of problems have begun to manifest
themselves in many of the public enterprises. Serious problems are observed in the
insufficient growth in productivity, poor project management, over-manning, lack of
continuous technological upgradation, and inadequate attention to R&amp;D and human
resource development. In addition, public enterprises have shown a very low rate of return
on the capital invested. This has inhibited their ability to re-generate themselves in
terms of new investments as well as in technology development. The result is that many of
the public enterprises have become a burden rather than being an asset to the Government.
The original concept of the public sector has also undergone considerable dilution. The
most striking example is the take over of sick units from the private sector. This
category of public sector units accounts for almost one third of the total losses of
central public enterprises. Another category of public enterprises, which does not fit
into the original idea of the public sector being at the commanding heights of the
economy, is the plethora of public enterprises which are in the consumer goods and
services sectors.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">32. It is time therefore that the Government adopt a new approach to
public enterprises. There must be a greater commitment to the support of public
enterprises which are essential for the operation of the industrial economy. Measures must
be taken to make these enterprises more growth oriented and technically dynamic. Units
which may be faltering at present but are potentially viable must be restructured and
given a new lease of life. The priority areas for growth of public enterprises in the
future will be the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Essential infrastructure goods and services.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Exploration and exploitation of oil and mineral resources.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Technology development and building of manufacturing capabilities in
          areas which are crucial in the long term development of the economy and where private
          sector investment is inadequate.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Manufacture of products where strategic considerations predominate
          such as defence equipment.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time the public sector will not be barred from entering
areas not specifically reserved for it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">33. In view of these considerations, Government will review the
existing portfolio of public investments with greater realism. This review will be in
respect of industries based on low technology, small scale and non-strategic areas,
inefficient and unproductive areas, areas with low or nil social considerations or public
purpose, and areas where the private sector has developed sufficient expertise and
resources.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">34. Government will strengthen those public enterprises which fall in
the reserved areas of operation or are in high priority areas or are generating good or
reasonable profits. Such enterprises will be provided a much greater degree of management
autonomy through the system of memoranda of understanding. Competition will also be
induced in these areas by inviting private sector participation. In the case of selected
enterprises, part of Government holdings in the equity share capital of these enterprises
will be disinvested in order to provide further market discipline to the performance of
public enterprises. There are a large number of chronically sick public enterprises
incurring heavy losses, operating in a competitive market and serve little or no public
purpose. These need to be attended to. The country must be proud of the public sector that
it owns and it must operate in the public interest.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MONOPOLIES AND RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT
(MRTP ACT)</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">35. The principal objectives sought to be achieved through the MRTP Act
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <ol type="i">
          <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prevention of concentration of economic power to the common
            detriment, control of monopolies, and</p>
          </li>
          <li><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prohibition of monopolistic and restrictive and unfair trade
            practices.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">36. The MRTP Act became effective in June 1970. With the emphasis
placed on productivity in the Sixth Plan, major amendments to the MRTP Act were carried
out in 1982 and 1984 in order to remove impediments to industrial growth and expansion.
This process of change was given a new momentum in 1985 by an increase of threshold limit
of assets.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">37. With the growing complexity of industrial structure and the need
for achieving economies of scale for ensuring high productivity and competitive advantage
in the international market, the interference of the Government through the MRTP Act in
investment decisions of large companies has become deleterious in its effects on Indian
industrial growth. The pre-entry scrutiny of investment decisions by so called MRTP
companies will no longer be required. Instead, emphasis will be on controlling and
regulating monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade practices rather than making it
necessary for the monopoly house to obtain prior approval of Central Government for
expansion, establishment of new undertakings, merger, amalgamation and takeover and
appointment of certain directors. The thrust of policy will be more on controlling unfair
or restrictive business practices. The MRTP Act will be restructured by eliminating the
legal requirement for prior governmental approval for expansion of present undertakings
and establishment of new undertakings. The provisions relating to merger, amalgamation,
and takeover will also be repealed. Similarly, the provisions regarding restrictions on
acquisition of and transfer of shares will be appropriately incorporated in the Companies
Act.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">38. Simultaneously, provisions of the MRTP Act will be strengthened in
order to enable the MRTP Commission to take appropriate action in respect of the
monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade practices. The newly empowered MRTP Commission
will be encouraged to require investigation suo moto or on complaints received from
individual consumers or classes of consumers.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>DECISIONS OF GOVERNMENT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">39. In view of the considerations outlined above Government have
decided to take a series of measures to unshackle the Indian industrial economy from the
cobwebs of unnecessary bureaucratic control. These measures complement the other series of
measures being taken by Government in the areas of trade policy, exchange rate management,
fiscal policy, financial sector reform and overall macro economic management.</p>
