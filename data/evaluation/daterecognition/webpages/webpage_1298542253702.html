<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font></h3>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Abrams&#39; law</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The rule stating that with given materials, curing, and 
testing conditions, concrete strength is inversely related to the ratio of water 
to cement. Low water-to-cement ratios produce higher strengths.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Abrasive aggregate</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The aggregate used to increase the abrasiveness of the 
surface of a concrete slab.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">Abrasion 
Resistance</span></strong></font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The ability of a surface from being worn from wear and 
tear from regular use or abuse.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">Abrasive 
Blasting </span></strong></font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Using the force of an abrasive material shot at a 
surface at high velocity to remove, profile or etch its surface, for decorative 
or functional reasons. Materials include but are not limited to, sand, metal 
shot, or dry ice. </font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Absolute volume</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">In concrete, the actual volume occupied by the 
different ingredients determined by dividing the weight of each ingredient 
pounds, by its specific gravity, times the weight of one cubic foot of water in 
pounds. <br>
<br>
Example: Absolute Volume of one sack of cement equals: 94 ÷ (3.15 x 62.4) = 
0.478 cubic feet.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Absorption</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The process by which water is absorbed. The amount of 
water absorbed under specific conditions, usually expressed as percentage of the 
dry weight of the material.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Absorption loss</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Water losses that occur until the aggregate in a 
concrete mix is saturated. See aggregate.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Acceleration</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The speeding up of the setting or hardening process of 
concrete by using an additive in the mix. The process of acceleration allows 
forms to be stripped sooner or floors finished earlier. See accelerators.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Accelerators</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Material additives used to accelerate, or reduce, the 
setting time of concrete causing it to harden faster. Accelerators often include 
calcium chloride, or aluminum sulfate or other acidic materials. See set 
retarders.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Accessories</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The items used to assemble scaffolding, shoring, and 
forms, other than the walers, frames, and the forms themselves in the placing of 
concrete. See curb and gutter forms, flatwork forms, filler forms, flexible 
forms, straight forms, and walers.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Acetone</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A colorless, volatile, extremely flammable liquid 
ketone, CH<sub>3</sub>COCH<sub>3</sub>, widely used as an organic solvent. Often 
used in decorative concrete for a quick flashing color deposit, and dilution 
agent for concrete sealers.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Acid Etch</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The process by which an acid (often times muriatic or 
hydrochloric) is used to etch and prepare a cement surface for painting or the 
application of some type of coating system. </font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Acid Stain</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A combination of metallic salts, muriatic acid, and 
water that when applied to a cement-based surface, the acid in the solution 
etches into the surface allowing for the metallic salts to penetrate in and 
react with the free lime deposits, or calcium hydroxide, in the cement. Water in 
the solution fuels the reaction creating colored compounds that become a 
permanent part of the concrete. The colors deposited create a mottled, naturally 
variegated pattern of color. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Chemical Acid Stains are generally available in 
variations of five basic color groups: Blacks, Browns, Oranges, Aged Copper &amp; 
Greens - all of these shades are natural earthy mineral tones.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF"><a name="adjustable_hanger">Adiabatic curing</a></font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The maintenance of ambient conditions during the 
setting and hardening of concrete so that heat is neither lost nor gained from 
the surroundings of the concrete.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Adjustable Hanger</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A forming accessory, a metal strip, used to suspend or 
support metal forms or metal form attachments when traditional methods of 
anchoring forms or form attachments cannot be used due to trenching or prior 
concrete placement. See hanger.</font></p>

cubic foot, roughly one-third the weight of stone concrete. A high temperature, 
high-pressure steam cure in an autoclave speeds additional chemical reactions, 
which allow the AAC to reach full strength in less than twenty-four (24) hours. 
AAC is easy to use on a job site and provides excellent sound proofing and fire 
protection.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Cure</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Method of maintaining sufficient internal humidity and 
proper temperature for freshly placed concrete to assure proper hydration of the 
cement, and proper hardening of the concrete. See hydration.</font></p>
<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Curing</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The hardening of concrete, plaster, or other wet 
material. Curing typically occurs through the evaporation of water or a solvent, 
hydration, polymerization, or chemical reactions of various types. It is the 
final process, after placing and compacting, that ensures the concrete will set 
to its desired strength. The length of time is dependent upon the type of 
cement, mix proportion, required strength, size and shape of the concrete 
section, weather and future exposure conditions. The period may be 3 weeks or 
longer for lean concrete mixtures used in structures such as dams or it may be 
only a few days for richer mixes. Favorable curing temperatures range from 50° 
to 70° F. Design strength is achieved in 28 days. See cement mixture, 
compaction, hydration, and set.</font></p>

maintaining satisfactory moisture content and temperature in concrete during its 
early stages so that it may obtain the desired properties. See placing and 
compaction.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A chemical applied to the surface of fresh concrete to

<h3><font color="#FFFFFF">Curing membrane</font></h3>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Any of several kinds of sheet material or spray-on
