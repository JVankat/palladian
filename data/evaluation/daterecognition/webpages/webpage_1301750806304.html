I was also amazed by the amount of drunk people that left the bars and jumped in their cars! Sounds like a rap song, except thats not made up its the truth. The people I was with were smart enough to take a cab to and from the bars. Another thing that caught my attention was the age of these offenders. 21-30ish I'd say. I guess they need the experience of killing themselves or god forbid innocent people! Wake up people! This is real, not a game. Sorry to sound so down, WI folks are some of the coolest people I've ever meet! Theres alot to live for in the beautiful state of Wisconsin! Go Packers!!!</p>

Drinking is fun, it is a social event, it is a part of Wisconsin heritage and it is a problem for those who cannot handle it or for those who get severly impaired judgement. <br /> I do not feel sorry for anyone caught drunk driving, that should be their wake up call. No one forces you to do the wrong thing, to make the wrong decision. But killing someone from drunk driving is a down right sin and should be extremely punishable.<br />  <br />  You know what I think is worse than drunk driving?<br />  <br />  Cell phones and driving!!!!!!!!!<br />  <br /> I have been run off the road 5 times because of some a-hole talking on their teeny tiny cell phone and not paying attention! I also ride my own Harley-Davidson and I fear cell phone drivers waaaaaaaaaaay more than drunk drivers. <br />  (no I don't have a cell phone - I refuse!)<br /> At bars, bartenders or your friends can take your keys because you are visibly too drunk to drive, which is a very cool thing to do.<br />  Too bad they don't do that for cell phone drivers.<br />  Ever looked up the stats on cell phone driving accidents - you'll be very surprized!!!!<br />  <br /> Look, I know sober people that shouldn't be behind the wheel - either way, I think we all suck at driving whether it's drunks, using phones, teens, elders....we all need to shape up and be more attentive and respectful to other people on the road. It never used to be this bad.............what has changed?<br />  </p>

The reality is we can't afford not to lock up drunk drivers,to punish them for their indiscriminate, selfish killing. Our sympathy for the drunk driver is misdirected;the decision to drink and drive was theirs.

However the government will never be able to eliminate drunk driving completely, even if MADD and propagandists like the Journal Sentinel succeed in installing mandated breathalyser interlocks on every car, truck, riding lawnmower and pogo stick in the state. I now live in a state where there are checkpoints. The locals know where they are and avoid them, but tourists don't and its just a moneymaker for the state. It's all a pattern of more jackboot police enforcement that deluded sheeplike American citizens like MADD seem to just love to inflict on everyone. Keep your slippery slopes to yourselves.</p>

                                                        <p>There are hundreds of comments here, but they fall into two categories: those from people who feel that we do have a drinking problem in Wisconsin and those who don't. Those who don't either take the position that &quot;they drink in other states, too, so it's not a Wisconsin problem&quot; or &quot;I drink. I get drunk. I fall down. No problem.&quot; Both of these positions are irresponsible and both, I believe, come from people who &quot;protest too much.&quot; It's not a liberal vs conservative thing. It's not an anti-fun thing. And it certainly isn't about you! The fact is that the irresponsible use of alcohol ruins lives. Period. The argument that there are other ways to ruin one's life is irrelevant. The series is about alcohol and its impact on people--both people who drink and people who do not. This is also not an issue of personal freedom. Nowhere in the Constitution is it stated that anyone has a right to do anything they please with no regard for anyone else. &quot;This is America&quot; is the lamest excuse for bad behavior. Behaving like a jackass and/or endangering someone else's life is not a protected freedom. If you want to get stupid drunk, smoke like a chimney and eat junk food, that's great as long as you don't screw up my evening out, cost me money, or hurt me or my family. Similarly, you can ride your motorcycle in sandals, shorts, and a baseball cap as far as I'm concerned as long as none of your bodily fluids get on my car and I don't have to pay for your medical care.<br />  <br /> So all of you who say, &quot;Hey, this is what we do. Your problem is you're a liberal elitist anti-fun stodgy preachy (latte-sipping) know-it-all and you don't really understand what a cool masculine patriotic all-American all-Wisconsin thing it is to get wasted every chance I get,&quot; good for you. Have fun. Just don't come crying to me when you wreck your car, your liver, your job, your marriage, your freedom, and your life. And stay away from me!</p>

I lived in Milwaukee for 13 years and it is SO different up here in the Twin Cities. People here take drinking and driving very seriously and the VERY tough laws here reflect that feeling. When I lived in Milwaukee I knew (and myself included at times) alot of people that drank and drove their cars all the time (mostly at bar time). People would just laugh and say how they didn't know how they made it home the night before or ran out to the garage to make sure the car wasn't damaged from driving home the night before. I am not saying it is perfect here in Minneapolis but there are many more alternatives and ways to make it home safely. Toughen the laws in Wisconsin and provide alternatives to getting home safely and things will change.</p>

That is, the penalty needs to be higher as the blood alcohol content becomes higher. Many people are fine at .08%, but why aren't we hammering down on those who blow 2, 3 and even 4 times the legal limit. It is those folks who are being ridiculously irresponsible and who need to be off the road.

                                                        <p>As a twice convicted drunk driver, I agree with many of the points in this series which I'll get to shortly. However, there are a couple of things that really annony me when it comes to the presses coverage of drunk driving.<br />  <br /> How come there is no mention of how many people were in fatal car accidents that were sober are not mentioned in today's article? While I'm sure there is a higher proportion that had been drinking, it would be nice to hear both sides of the data.<br />  <br /> One other thing bothers me is that I'm sure there are people out there that have had 5 or more car accidents with out drinking involved. How come this is never publicized and where it the outrage?<br />  <br /> I had two DUI's and had to have an ignition interlock. I believe this is currently available to judges. The problem with these is I believe they try to make a profit on people that are required to have them. If I remember correctly, I paid $100 to have it installed and another $100 to have it taken out. I also had to rent the unit for I believe around $60 per month. If these were available to purchase at a reasonable price, I'd buy one and I'm sure others would too. I believe the problem is that because the majority of these are required by law, the manufacturers have no incentive to lower their prices. <br />  <br />  The idea of check points would be a true deterrent and I can't believe these aren't currently allowed.  <br />  <br />  </p>

It also depends on the bartenders that are over serving so they get a good tip. When i am working I pace my customers and if I feel they have had enough out comes the glass of water.So far all my customers have thanked me. Also if someone comes in from another bar and is drunk we ask for there keys serve them water and drive them home. Yes even with the gas prices as high as they are saving a life is worth more then the buck, Also serving food is a great help. But back to first statement Why can't people take responsibility for there actions and grow up when having that drink to realize hey a couple is good alot hurts.</p>

                                                        <p>Ouch - us Wisconsinites are touchy with you (Journal Sentinel writers) pointing the finger. Wisconsin doesn't have the problem, believe it or not, this is a great state.<br /> It's people that have problems. I like beer. I like vodka too and I find myself looking forward to that refreshing mixed drink after a hard day of BS at the office because my governemnt is taxing us too hard and too much. So could I have a problem? Naw, I just live here, work hard, pay my bills and enjoy my free time. I love Wisconsin, but to lay it down so easily as to say the whole state has a drinking problem.....that cuts deep.<br /> Yeah drinking and driving is undeniably horrible and just stupid, but it will never be solved, sorry to say. I personally don't drink and drive because I respect the law, myself and other people. <br /> But this is a very personal subject. Many people don't like to think they have a problem at all let alone with alcohol. We live in an area where summer festivals are legendary, parties revolve around keggers and drinks and you can't have a wedding toast without champagne now can you. <br /> It's not our state, it's our heritage, history, families and friends. It's great that we live in such a fun, vibrant city, but drunk driving is everywhere....we all just haven't been caught yet.<br />  <br />  </p>

                                                        <p>Hey Chuck, for 25 years old you sure have a lot of anger. Thanks for your opinion but you make it sound like yours is from a chapter in the Bible, get real man. If you don't like Wisconsin, Kenosha, bars or your neighborhood, feel free to move. I don't think anyone is holding you hostage right? Look, you made some vaild points and I understand your frustration, but solutions are not simple nor do they happen in a short amount of time. <br /> Governments to my knowledge have really never been all that fair, but if you abide by the rules you should be fine....for the most part.<br /> As far as Milwaukee / Wisconsin pride. I've lived here with my family like many others and am very, very proud of Wisconsin's heritage and history. A lot of great memories are held in the 4 walls of many local bars. I met my husband at a bar, yeah we were drunk, it was great. <br />  Take a break Chuck from your thoughts for the day and sit back and enjoy a cold one on me. <br />  </p>

I guess that some people would rather get in a car and drive while drunk and risk killing someone instead of &quot;risking&quot; riding the bus. People who complain about public transportation in MKE don't know what they're talking about. The bus is fine.

Madison is all about getting loaded as fast as possible. Milwaukee likes to stretch it out longer, which I think is a better drunk anyway. So, of course, Wisconsin has a drinking problem; look where most of our ancestors came from-Ireland, Germany, Poland, and Russia, all places well known for their hearty, heavy-drinking ways. It should be no surprise that we followed suit! The fact is, someone else's drinking habits are nobody else's business until they get behind the wheel. Where's the call for public transit? Keep this discussion focused on the behaviors we can regulate, not the morality we want others to follow.</p>

Recreational activities that place alcohol high on the agenda such as snowmobile runs from tavern to tavern; alcohol tied to boating activities; beer tents at all festivals etc.<br />  <br /> Wisconsin also has a driving problem on Highway 41, especially from Oshkosh to Green Bay, with particular emphasis on Appleton, Little Chute, Kaukauna. The only place I have experienced where semis speed up (from 65-70 to greater speeds) when approaching Appleton. Cars are rudely driven, lane swapping at high speed, no signals, high speed, improper merging and tailgating.</p>

Everything is evolved about beer, beer and more beer.<br />  The bars need to stop giving out more beer to customers once their glass is empty.  Stop some of the teenage drinking also.</p>

Not about making sure the people get help. It is a money maker. If someone introduced a bill to permanently take away the license of anyone caught driving drunk the insurance industry lobbyists would be all over Madison to block it. <br />  <br /> Another problem is that too many people that should not have a license to begin with have one. Then when they drink they really can't drive or they ignore even more rules of the road. <br />  <br /> If you want to get rid of any possibility of drunk drivers you can abolish alcohol. Of course you would have to abolish most grains, fruits, potatoes, dandelions and anything else you can ferment.<br />  <br />  </p>

I've read numerous people say that its not the city or the governments fault, and that the fault lies in the hands of the people doing the actual drunk driving. Well no joke! We already know that! But people aho do it arent going to suddenly read your comment about that and say, &quot;Wow, I better quit!&quot; They know they are at fault, and they dont care, thats why they keep doing it. And they will continue to do it until the law steps in. And dont say that it's not the laws responsibilty, because it is. Thats why we the people grant law enforcement the necessary power to protect us. and that &quot;us&quot; includes other drivers on the road! Others of you say that the legal limit should be raised as long as the driver rides a moped and wear protective gear and only goes 30 MPH, is this not completly assinine to anybody else? It doesnt matter what your driving, it's illegal! Which by defination means your not allowed to do it (punishable if you do). There are no exceptions that should be made here, zero tolerance means none. Why would it matter if your on a moped? You can still hit something or somebody, if if your doing a slower speed limit it's not going to do as much damage? What if you pull out in front of somebody and they have to swerve to get out of the way, this could cause an accident killing somebody. I fully believe that alot of the blame lies on the enforcement of DUI's, after all it's like a child and his mother, if the kid keeps stealing candy from the jar and later the kid complains of a upset stomach, after awhile its the mothers fault if she knew it was going on and didnt step in. This is the power we give to law enforcement agencies. And its the power that my tax dollars pay for. And than others say we should all just take public transportation and it would be safer. Have any of you actually listened to what your saying? I dont know if your've realized this, but vehicles arev ery expensive now-a-days. And since I bought a nice one, I think I'll choose to drive it. why should I make other arrangements just so you wont hit me when your drunk? Not to mention all the violence on public transportation, women getting punched in the face and whatnot. The bottom line here is that Wi has a very serious alcohol problem. People here must have nothing better to do than get drunk all the time! I'm not some old fuddy duddy either, I'm 25 and like to drink occasionally, but I always have a ride home. I think that people dont understand towns like Kenosha, who is in the guiness book of world records for something haveing to do with the most bars, isnt a town to be proud of. Is it that braggable that we have an enourmous amount of bars? Wow, you people must really be proud. And yet those are the same people who compalin of &quot;rough neighboorhoods&quot;, get real....what do you expect from a place that has a corner bar on every block. It's not going to be a nice place to raise kids. This is why people dont like to live in cities. (It's a larger place to me because I'm from a small rural town down south). I personally find the crime and drinking to be completly out of hand. I get sick of going home to find broken bottles of beer in the parking lot of my apartment complex, not only are they drunks, but their so much in a hurry to pop the top on another beer they cant even throw the bottle in a trash can! And whats this have to do with my point? The broken bottle is the same as a drunk driver....it's always somebody else's problem. Is this so? I sure dont think so, I think people need to get off that milwaukee brewery pride thing and get a little more mature with drinking. I'm tired of hearing about the dui's and the deaths every single night on the news, it's like a broken record. I personally think that either the law needs to crack down and stop looking the other way or we need to have another prohibition! I li</p>

The man that I was involved with put mental anguish on the whole household. This state needs to address the deep rooted affects of alcohol. These men and woman need counseling. You wonder why these people have 3 4 or 5 offenses? They will continue unless something is done and not just to throw them in prison and throw away the key. That's not the answer when will we get that? All it's doing is ignoring the real problem. <br /> I appreciate this weeks editoral on Drinking and Driving!!

(saracastic) That is sure to make things better and keep people from a FOURTH offense.<br />  A person with a THIRD offense, even a second offense should NOT have the privilege of having a driver's license.<br /> Wisconsin's drunk driving laws are a joke. After a first offense a person should be spending 30 days to 6 months in jail. So many people do not think drinking and driving is a big deal because &quot;nothing will ever happen to them&quot;. What happens when something does happen? When a child is killed? A pregnant mother? Your sister? Your parent? Then all of a sudden it is a big deal. More severe consequences NEED to be put into place.<br /> The fact that individuals do not designate a driver more often, call for a ride, or take a bus when having too much to drink is sad. If people cannot keep themselves as well as others safe, drunk drivers deserve severe punishment - the FIRST time.</p>

DRINKING and DRIVING is the issue not the drinking. . . However we need to examine not just the statistics but the root of problem. This could be any city USA with a high level of alochol related problems. The big issue is lets examine the culture. It is a generation of drinkers &quot;that is the way it has always been&quot; &quot;Tradition&quot; for example tailgating sport parties Many of WI people are proud of their sports like any other USA city. However tailgating seems to have a higher tradition in WI than most cities. I am not trying to blame drinking on sports or bars in WI. IT IS THE IRRESPONSIBILITY OF THE PERSON DRINKING and repeat offender that is not held accountable for their action. No one said DO NOT DRINK by all means wine and other spirits have medicinal value if done responsible in moderation. I also feel that people are so bored with themselves that by drinking it fills their calendar that they are doing something. . . in other words people have too much idle time on their hands so instead of doing something productive they drink . . .irresponsibly which is destructrive. PLEASE choose wisely if you drink don't drive and if you do drink drink responsibly. <br />  </p>

This problem is nationwide, not local.<br />  <br /> People will continue to drink and drive, no matter the consequence. There is alcohol aplenty in this part of the country, and there is nothing anyone can do to stem it short of another prohibition era. The real problem manifests itself with the irresponsible folks, who, apparently, feel compelled to drive down a city street at 100mph and wrap their car around a pole, after downing a 12-pack of beer.<br />  <br /> Meanwhile, after a baseball game, you have 45,000 people exiting Miller Park, many of which whom have had their fair share of beer, manage to drive home safely after every regular season game with minimal problems - Why? Because responsible people who consume alcohol possess certain inhibitions that prevent them from taking actions such as driving like idiots and killing people.<br />  <br /> Is this an excuse? By all means - no. But keep things in perspective; you will eventually realize that we are keeping things just in pace with the rest of the country. We are no different.<br />  <br />  </p>

One of the main things I see as being a problem is that when someone gets caught the consequences are not that severe. Six months-year is not enough time issued for taking someones life. Also, I think that one day a week should be set aside to being a dry-state for Wisconsin. Also let's implament something to make sure that we are not selling alcohol to under age drinkers.</p>

Make Bluemound Road eight lanes wide.<br />  Milwaukee's &quot;death alley&quot; will be even longer and have more lanes than Bolero.<br />  <br /> Sometimes Milwaukee really does deserve that blue shirt monument on the parking garage at the William Mitchell International airport.</p>

                                                        <p>Alot of people are saying that a person with a DUI can keep driving. After you are cited for DUI you have your licience for 30 days at that point IT IS SUSPENDED. Anyone saying different doesn't know any thing about the law. You get a fine, revocation (for at least 6 months) and some sort of drunk driving classes after the first time you are caught. After the second time you get jail,fines, schooling and driving interlocks on your car. You are also required by law to an assesment and some sort of Drunk driveing school. On the second tome your jail time is 7 to 30 days and after your 3rd it is 30 days up to 6 months. you get car interlocks after the 2nd time, judges have the right to assign it and they ussually do. It also has to do with your blood alcohol levels. The laws are stick enough! I believe we need to address the peoples attitude toward Driveing. Even if you take away the persons driving Licience they can still get in the car and take off driveing. Stiffining the penalties only feeds the gobvernment coffers.</p>

Of those, at least 208 involved drunk drivers who had a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or more &mdash; beyond the legal limit. A total of 234 people were killed in those crashes.&quot;<br />  <br /> &quot;Alcohol related&quot; just means that someone involved in the accident was drinking, not driving. That's a spin MADD put on the numbers years ago. So the only relevant number is that 208 crashes involved drunk drivers, killing 234 people.<br />  <br /> According to the JS, WI traffic fatalities total in 2007 was 41,059 people. 234 isn't even 1% of the total traffic fatalities in WI.<br />  <br /> Yet MADD and the PC would have you believe that any second you're on the road you're in danger of being killed by a drunk driver. MADD has to scare you into believing that or they'd all be out of jobs. Don't forget both they and your local government gets a cut of each DUI conviction.<br />  <br />  Need more money? Lower the BAC.  &quot;Create&quot; more criminals to justify your existence.<br />  </p>

                                                        <p>I'm a born and raised in Wisconsin. I'm a father of four and a grandfather of 6. Losing a loved one to a drunken driver has to be devastating. Fortunately, I've never had to experience that terrible situation. I do drink. I do go to taverns, restaurants, wedding dances, fests of all kinds. And I will admit there were times when I shouldn&rsquo;t have gotten behind the wheel. I don&rsquo;t know if there are studies on this but I would hazard a guess that about 90% of those that drink would admit to the same.<br />  <br /> I&rsquo;ve lived in other states from the East coast to the West coast. No other state that I&rsquo;ve lived in or visited has the culture that Wisconsin enjoys. I&rsquo;ve lived in various places in Wisconsin from Milwaukee for a short time in the &lsquo;40&rsquo;s to small towns as little as 500 population. Milwaukee in the 40&rsquo;s had neighborhood taverns virtually on every block or so it seemed. I lived in one town with a population of 1,800 that had 12 taverns. It was a place where neighbor&rsquo;s and friends got together to visit and play Sheepshead or Skat. Almost always full of laughter and fun. Gem&uuml;tlichkeit. It was as much as a part of life as the church.<br />  <br /> In the 1940&rsquo;s if there were 25 people in a tavern there might have been 2 or 3 cars parked outside. Today there would be 15 &ndash; 20 cars. Times have changed. These numbers by themselves would account for increased drinking and driving. Increased drinking and driving leads to more accidents, some of them fatal. That is the society we live in. A free one. We live and die by our decisions. When an innocent person dies as a result of someone&rsquo;s bad decision is it any worse that alcohol was involved or it was caused by just plain stupidity.<br />  <br />  Here&rsquo;s some stats that are interesting.<br />  <br />  2,397,615 total deaths in US<br />  15,829 deaths in alcohol related accidents<br />  435,000 deaths from smoking<br />  567,683 deaths from being overweight. <br />  225,000 (estimate) deaths caused by doctors (iatrogenic)<br />  93% of the traffic accidents have no alcohol involved.<br />  <br /> *According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), &quot;A motor vehicle crash is considered to be alcohol-related if at least one driver or non-occupant (such as a pedestrian or pedal cyclist) involved in the crash is determined to have had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .01 gram per deciliter (g/dL) or higher. Thus, any fatality that occurs in an alcohol-related crash is considered an alcohol-related fatality. The term 'alcohol-related' does not indicate that a crash or fatality was caused by the presence of alcohol.&quot;<br />  <br /> So, here again, these are stats available on the internet and of course we are all aware of the fact that stats can be made to read pretty much the way the statistician wants. However this MADD thing has some very undesirable effects. Like making a social drinker a criminal. Why don&rsquo;t they just come out and admit it. They&rsquo;re really prohibitionists. <br />  <br /> Who set the bar at an arbitrary 1.0 to begin with? At 220 lbs. I believe if I had 4 - 12 oz., I was supposed to be at the limit for driving.<br />  <br /> If alcohol consumption/sales laws are states rights, where do the Feds get off coming in with highway funds blackmail if the states didn&rsquo;t drop to another arbitrary .08? And why did the Governor roll over for it?<br />  <br /> As it is now, drunk driving laws are nothing more than revenue producers for the local, county and state law enforcement agencies. There&rsquo;s already enough laws on the books to put away the habitual drunk driver.<br />  <br /> I&rsquo;ve had friends pulled over for &ldquo;weaving within your lane&rdquo;, &ldquo;excessive lane changing&rdquo;, &ldquo;you kind of rolled through that right turn on a red light&rdquo; and a variety of other thinly veiled excuses for getting in your face to smell your breath. It seems the cops like to use the old door-to-door sales adage that if you knock on enough doors, sooner or later you will get a sale.<br />  <br />  Between 2:00a and 3:00a, two squads park along side of a stretch of 4 lane highway where the speed limit is 30 mph. </p>

First time was OK it happened I knew it would happen it was just a matter of time. Second time, well let me tell you that no picnic. It was expensive even though the articles does say it. You have to get AA counseling, drunk driving classes, pay for attorney, suspended license high insurance rates. All of this you pay out pf your pocket. You get the picture. However if you think that being under house arrest is easy &amp; fun you have another thing coming.<br /> You have to pay to live in your own home for the duration of your sentence so ITS NOT FREE. You have to check in every week to the HOC &amp; be degraded with a search where they can touch you body any way they like. Plus you have to drop a pee sample &amp; pee right in front of the guard. If you think this is easy or fun think again. IT'S degrading to be treat like a common criminal when you only mistake was BAD judgement.<br /> I no longer drink &amp; drive, but I think that if people who decide to go out for a few &amp; get carried away because they are having fun, there should be a better program in place other than BADD (bartenders against drunk drivers) I have used BADD &amp; it's good, but it's not city, country or state wide. We have the DOT with dollars coming from the federal government why not have a state wide program for people who don't want to make a STUPID choice &amp; get in their car to drive home. When you have been drinking at one point in time all you want to do is get home &amp; you really don't care how you get there as long as you get there Get a program in place to stop drunk drivers from being on the road in the first place is a good start to combat this problem.</p>

Considering how few drunken drivers get caught, &quot;according to studies&quot; you have to be really bad, to get stopped as many times as some of these people have been stopped. These are the people we need to get off the roads.<br />  <br /> Second, I believe the number of accidents blamed on alcohol is overstated. The reason I say this is because regardless of who was at fault for the accident, it is listed as alcohol related, even if the completely sober person caused the accident.<br />  <br /> Example: Stopped in a line of cars at a stop light and the sober person rear ends the car of someone who has some alcohol in their system. This is a alcohol related accident even though the person with the alcohol in there system was obeying the law and was only in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

                                                        <p>There is a simple solution to this problem!!!<br />  <br />  The Goal:<br />  Keep drunk drivers from killing other people on the roads..<br />  <br />  Solution:   BE PRO-ACTIVE<br /> Rather than pouring millions and millions of dollar into enforcing something that's been part of our culture and I might add, Enforcement has not deterred anyone from drunk driving, it's made Lawyers and insurance companies and accessment people very rich. &quot;Stop Reacting&quot; It doesn't work and cost a lot of money and valuable resources!!!!<br />  <br /> The only thing that the present drunk driving law does is financially hurts the first and second time people and families and stresses an over stress system.. What has it prevented? There are more third and more offenders as a result of the newer blood alcohol limits. We have more alcohol related injures and deaths than ever... <br />  <br /> Fear/Enforcement hasn't deterred anyone. the person who's arrested for third-time and more drunk drivers doesn't care about going to jail, His or Her usage of alcohol attacks their reasoning, so their very sorry when he or she is sober &quot;after the fact&quot; and can't make the proper decission while under the influence. Simple! PROVIDE them A RIDE HOME and everyone wins, and make them pay for it, it is surely cheaper the what we are doing now!! <br />  <br /> Evidence and facts have shown that your not going to stop him or her any other way!!! So are we to continue to re-act to the problem by throwing more money at something that is not working... <br />  <br /> What does it cost in time and dollars to have a law enforcement officer(s),usually one or more, process one drunk driver verses getting the individual home safely and protect the public??? <br />  <br /> What is &quot;Enforcement&quot; and &quot;Penalizing&quot; costing us?? Cops, More jails and people to take care of the more prisoners, if you toughen the Law, More Lawyers/Judges, Cost of insurance, more courts, Millions and millions of wasted dollars that is not solving the problem or achieving any of the goals...We just made more criminals...<br />  <br /> If it were possible for everyone to stop drinking alcohol, where will the State get the tax money it counts on as a result in sales???<br />  <br /> If we focused half, just half of the resources in providing PRO-ACTIVE solutions rather than re-active(after the fact expensive) man-dates that do nothing but cost everyone money and stresses a already burdened system...<br />  <br /> As an example; Have the Tavern league and M.A.D. work together to form a comprehensive &quot;PRO-ACTIVE&quot; solution to the problem and stop throwing away all of Our Money on things that just don't work and hurt the everyday first and second offenders(How many people are killed or injured by first and second offenders?)... <br />  <br /> Toughen the Laws For Third and more offenders, jail means jail and emphasize more technology to prevent the action, have options for people rather than creating more criminals(PRO ACTIVE SOLUTIONS DO WORK) them from driving..<br />  <br />  There, Now your making a difference and helping everyone to the common goal and at reduced cost with real results...<br />  <br /> Just let's just say you can get two Counties of similar size with near the same fatality/Accident rate, have them cooperate with a scientific study. Heck have one of the Universities or Tech-schools make it a project and little or no cost...<br />  <br />  County A, enforces the laws as usual...keeping track of everything in the process..<br />  <br /> County B, provides, using volunteers, (M.A.D.) (Tavern League) auxiliaries, etc. what ever resources can be used to accomplish this... The sheriff's Transport van that we paid for are idle after 6pm until 7 or 8am anyways... Put the word out about this new proactive service, GO TO JAIL AND SPEND Thousands of Dollars or spend 25 to 50 dollars for a ride home... Give people and bar owners options that do not hurt everyone.<br />  <br /> The results would be very shocking in County B vs County A, more proactive community service would ultimately accomplish the goals we want...<br />  <br />  In closing<br />  <br />  <br />      I have driven under the influence.<br /> </p>

People who drink and drive are a problem; people who drink themselves into incoherence are problems; people who use alcohol to solve problems are the problem; people who use alcohol to loosen up are a problem. People who can't have fun without too much alcohol are problems. The Tavern League lobbies for all of that; they are also a problem. There's nothing wrong with a beer with that brat or a glass of wine with the salad. Our mindset in Wisconsin is that overindulgence is funny and fun. THAT'S a problem</p>

The drinking culture is no different here in Wisconsin than in any of the places I have been. The only difference is Wisconsin has more people that drink and more drinking establishments. So with more people drinking and more establishments there will be higher numbers in the problem drinking catagories. There are people with drinking problems in every state in the Union. Tougher penalties is not the answer. Having people understand the problem and teaching them how to drink socially is. As for the smoking ban issue. People have the right not to frequent or work in establishments that allow smoking. This is not Russia, you have a choice!. If the state feels that strongly about smoking being a health and public safety issue, then they should ban all smoking statewide. But they can't afford the loss of tax revenue and will propably get voted out of office if they do this. They want their cake and eat it too.</p>

I think that WI has a serious policy problem with drunk driving and many individuals have a seriously abusive relationship with alcohol!!! Especially considering the fact that this woman had her 4 year old daughter in the car with her at the time she hit me almost head-on, and has been arrested for alcohol consumption since the accident as well- and as I sit here very much alive, but very broken, she is still out there driving around legally despite the evidence against her. This is her second offense and she did not have insurance when she hit me and my first question is how and why are policies in place that can let a driver like this back out on the road- and when she messes up how do the public taxpayers feel about being responsible for her $$$$ damages, her personal injuries, and then for her potential jail time? How can a person be sent back out onto the road 24 hours after they are arrested with a BAL above the legal limit, causing bodily harm, and risking the life of her daughter- I understand that in America we are innocent until proven guilty- but how is this not enough evidence to revoke her license on the spot? At what point should we consider revoking a license, at what point should we require insurance, and at what point do we hold the irresponsible drivers accountable, rather than the taxpayers for the financial clean up?</p>

I also sit alone Friday and Saturday nights, as I have all through high school in a town of about 4,000 people. Drinking is a social thing. We shouldn't scare people from socializing, especially in the cold, long winter months. I go crazy every weekend, alone in my dorm, knowing that there are parties up and down the hall, and in the houses and apartments off campus. Because of the stiff penalties of underage drinking, I am scared to get caught. When I do decide to drink, It will be without any practice. Nobody will have showed me how much is enough, and how to say no. That's my two cents.</p>

The problem is, when everyone you know drinks, you don't think it is a concern. That's why so many people are in denial about it. I didn't think I had a &quot;problem&quot; when my wife and I moved to Iola in 1996; but when we met friends who either didn't drink at all, or who only had one or two tops, it became apparent how much I had made alcohol part of my social life.

People cannot get together without alcohol. Even an event in a private home honoring a minor, such as a high school graduation open house, normally includes liquor. Roman Catholic churches sell liquor to raise funds at their summer &quot;festivals.&quot; People in other states do not behave this way. Drinking until one passes out or falls into a river is considered the norm at Wisconsin campuses. In light of this massive dysfunction, the carnage on our highways, facilitated by our spineless legislature, is completely consistent with the drinking &quot;culture&quot; in this state.</p>

Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states, Milwaukee is crap hole with no jobs, an inner-city that is run by gangs, unsafe public transit. MPS is a failure on most levels, and there is a huge lack of leadership at the state, city, and community levels. <br />  Wisconsin doesn't have a drinking problem it has a people problem.<br />  Create smarter, and responsible citizens and you will see the problems we now blame on alcohol diminish.</p>

People being killed by repeat offenders. I am married to an alcoholic. His sister is suffering from liver disease due to alcoholism. 75% of his family drink daily. Our laws should be stricter, and the repeat offenders, well I do not know what to do with them. Prison sentences should be longer, not so luxurious and sooner. Why wait until they drink 5 times! Alcoholism is overtaking our state! As well as our lives.</p>

Case in point: a high school coach (sport kept confidential) for a girl's team (school kept confidential) frequently hosted drinking parties for kids at his house with the argument being that &quot;they are going to drink anyway so they might as well do it in a safe environment and keep them off the streets.&quot; Now how sad is that?</p>

I moved here from another state so maybe it was more obvious to me, not growing up in the &quot;culture of drinking&quot; so prevalent in Wisconsin. <br />  <br /> I think it's a shame that anyone who publicly suggests reasonable curbs on alcohol consumption in Wisconsin gets labeled a &quot;neo-prohibitionist&quot;. This happens in Madison all the time. People need to take responsibility for their behavior and grow up. Binge-drinking is stupid and harmful--to the drinker and others who suffer the consequences of that person's drunken behavior, not to mention the costs associated with prosecuting crimes involving alcohol which, as these articles point out, are enormous.<br />  <br /> What will change the culture? That's a tough one but it has to start when kids are young and their parents and teachers are the best role models. You can't expect a kid to not binge-drink when his parents get wasted at tailgaters every fall weekend.<br />  <br /> The Wisconsin legislature is full of bodies who are heavily lobbied by the liquor industry. They're not going to change any laws unless there is lots of public pressure. It's a joke that Wisconsin hasn't raised its beer tax since 1969. What other tax hasn't been raised in almost 40 years?<br />  <br />  There's nothing wrong with drinking, just don't drink to excess.  Why do so many people in Wisconsin not understand that?</p>

It works because when drinking at a bar/event, judgement whether to drive is impaired. These folks don't want to break the law, it's a consequence of impaired judgement. Take the decision out of their hands and require a lifelong ignition interlock! Problem solved!</p>

Let's have some common sense about this, and enact some laws which penalize the truly dangerous potential murderers, not the responsible drinkers who - perhaps by virtue of being from Wisconsin? - are fine to drive at 0.08! Also, let's get more taxi vouchers and public transportation, perhaps funded by a small increase in the alcohol tax. How about an extra bus line down nightlife streets in Milwaukee/Madison/Green Bay/etc. at 1:45am? Or a carpool taxi voucher situation in smaller towns? Maybe something like this would work out.<br />  <br /> But smoking bans are something else. When you're drinking at a bar, that's all you're doing - drinking. If you're responsible, nobody's harmed, nobody gets hurt. Smoking, on the other hand, causes harm and illness in random people who just happen to be around you. The civil libertarian in me cries 'foul,' but sometimes, common sense has to trump ideology. Smoke outside, or at a bar's open-air patio or something. That's fine, you're not hurting anyone. But in crowded, public rooms, smoking has got to go.</p>

We sure knew how to do it well, but most people even those in high school with me were responsible. <br />  <br /> The way I see it WI needs to stiffen the laws. I now live in AZ and we have enacted some pretty tough laws these last few years. When you get your first DUI you must install a breath unit into every car in your household. I believe each one costs around 2K and then you must pay for a monthly monitoring fee.<br />  <br /> We also have a sliding scale of DUI's and each type of DUI, which is determined by your BAC level, has pretty strong fines and sentences to include a minimum. I would love to see my home state adopt such AZ now has. <br />  <br />  WE DON'T NEED TO REGULATE DRINKING WE NEED TO STIFFEN THE PENALTIES FOR THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAW.</p>

Perhaps the state could somehow subsidize tranportation in some way. Just like how the city buses are free on new years. We have one of the best public transportation infrastructures, but it is just not enough. If we could call a cab and pay the same amount a bus fare costs, I would think that most people would be less likely to drive themselves. I know that seems far fetched, but it is an idea. Traveling throughout the US and meeting/partying with many many people, I am proud of how I can drink beer. The only DUI I have had is &quot;Doing an Ugly Intern&quot; with those goggles:).<br /> However my upbringing in Wisconsin makes me proud of where I am from and I would hate for anything to change that.

We have lost friends and stopped being invited places because we no longer drink. No one says that's the reason, but it is. My husband comes from a drinking family, so drinking a lot was the norm. His brother moved to North Carolina and we found that it is much more &quot;normal&quot; not to drink or at least not much.<br />  <br /> He was arrested twice for drunk driving and by God's grace he never hurt anyone. We NEED tougher Drunk Drving laws and penalties. More people are killed annually by drunk drivers than were killed in the entire Iraq war....Interesting fact, huh!</p>

It's definitely a mindset in Wisconsin. <br />  <br /> My contemporaries in my neighborhood are definitely bigger partiers (drinkers mostly) than my friends back in Illinois. The difference is astounding.<br />  <br /> I attended the University of Illinois, and now my son is a student at UW-Madison. We drank in college...but they do it much bigger at UW than we ever did at U of I.</p>

Why are repeat offenders in WI out on the roads when Paris Hilton has jail time for a 2nd offense in California? We as voters need to know which state representatives vote which way when these issues are raised, and we need to vigorously support those legislators who will raise taxes on a barrel of beer (not since 1960's - are you kidding me?) as well as legislate stiff penalties for repeat offenses. Three strikes and you're out! <br />  <br /> I agree with writers who advocated higher fines starting with the FIRST offense. We need to send a loud message that impaired driving on the road and endangering innocent lives will not be tolerated. First offense, (besides a big fine) attach some relevant community service, perhaps in an emergency room or drug / alcohol rehab center.<br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  </p>

Three .08 convictions at one in the morning is not the same thing as one .20 conviction at two in the afternoon.<br />  <br /> Sobriety checkpoints? Checkpoints in the afternoon or during rush hour make more sense then checkpoints after midnight. The issue with alcohol and driving is that it impairs reaction time or in the most serious cases eliminates it altogether. At closing time, who is placed in danger? Generally speaking it is people who hang around in bars.<br />  <br /> Not that I advocate for no drunk driving enforcement at night/early morning, but .08 at closing time is not endangering the community. Drunk driving during the day, on the other hand, is something to rigorously enforce. But I have seen incredible acts of reckless driving occur right in front of a marked squad car in the middle of the day and did anyone get pulled over? No. The job of the police and the state is to protect the community. The police have scarce resources and using them to make criminals out of a .08 BAC at two in the morning is not a good use of those resources. Rather than use a policing strategy to control serious drunken driving that make such great headlines, we should use a public health approach of identifying those people and either creating some form of treatment or confinement.</p>

This state was held hostage once before by the Feds witholding monies unless we dropped the limit to .08. We did and the problem persists. What's next, zero tolerance? The JS mentions the cost to taxpayers in general terms but fails to mention the cash cow that owi fines have become for cities and counties.It makes one wonder if we really want to work on solving this problem or create an additional cash stream by creating more offenders? If the limit is dropped to .05 or below (as MADD is calling for) then every uncle and auntie returning from bingo could very well be a criminal. Do we want to solve a difficult problem with a knee jerk reaction? Another writer suggests you support your local tavern. I agree. My fear is that pandering politicians will bend to special interst groups and drive your local tavern out of business. Then people who drink won't have many choices at all.<br />  <br />  Read between the lines folks, prohibition is coming back.</p>

Using skewed numbers you come pretty close but &quot;alcohol related&quot; is a loaded statement. Take for example party A who has been drinking hits party B who runs a red light but is sober. From any reasonable viewpoint party B is at fault.<br /> Although it is almost certain alcohol played no role in this accident it gets lumped in with the alcohol related crashes. This is fact, not conjecture on my part.<br /> Without boring anyone or trying to distort reality, what is clear is the number one cause of accidents is bad driving habits and poor driving skills. Give a bad driver some booze and you have an awful driver. Give a skilled driver some booze and you probably end up with someone who is no worse off driving than the general public when sober.<br /> If anyone truly cares to fix the core problem it is not what you think. Instead it means improving driving skills across the board. It probably also includes full retest of those skills every 10 years or so. Not simply showing up at the DMV and plunking down money to renew a license.<br /> I am not in any way suggesting drinking and driving especially among repeat offenders is not a problem. It is. Those numbers do not lie no matter the reason someone is picked up for drinking and then driving.<br /> Everyone makes mistakes and the first offense should probably not be much more than points and a fine as it is now. This is where the current system should be fixed. A second offense should hurt. Loss of license for 2-3 years and jail time with or without work privilege depending on the circumstances surrounding offense number 2.<br />    If that doesn't work then number three should be end of the line with significant JAIL time.  No work release, nothing.<br /> I speak to this with some first hand knowledge because I have been there and it took more than a slap on the hand to correct my bad habits.<br /> The jails simply are not big enough to place everyone there for a first offense, and we are humans who make mistakes. As long as no one is harmed number one should be a minor infraction which will be a wake up call to some. Number two should be ugly as it was for me when I got three. All but hard core drinkers will stop after a significant punishment is endured.<br /> To help stop #3 from ever happening part of any sentence should be honest evaluation and classes. Not the lie and get out of jail free stuff we have now.<br />    In any event if someone reaches #3 that should be it by all means needed.<br /> Anyone who thinks you can ever stop drinking and driving completely lives in some sort of fantasy world. Even in Europe where the first offense is a serious crime, people still do it and are tossed in jail every day.<br /> I think we can do better and the cornerstone of the solution is making a drivers license a much harder thing to obtain and keep.</p>

Leave smoking out of this.<br /> Secondly, there's enough bars in this town where you shouldn't have to drive down to stupid Water St. to have a brew. If this was like Chicago and there was an elevated train line from your neighborhood to downtown, then going to stupid Water St. bars wouldn't be an issue (Other than the bars on Water St. are LAME...except Fitzgibbon's). Anyway, I just want to say &quot;SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD TAVERN!!&quot; I mean, go to a place you can walk to or get an inexpensive cab ride too. I've been to a few bars where I've received a cab waiver/ticket and taken the cab home for free. Maybe that should become more of a standard option around here, even free bus rides. The cost to take a cab or bus to pick up your car the next morning is small change, compared to an OWI and risking the lives of others. I love that this is a drinking state. I don't love that it's an irresponsible drinking state. Changing this states drinking habits will never happen, no matter how many people complain about it. Every holiday or birthday, or just about any family get-together, has been spent at a bar, and I don't mean a tavern, I mean the bar in the finished basement of my parents' house, grandparents' house, aunt &amp; uncles', etc. It's just the way we've been brought up, and we'll surely pass it on to generations to follow.<br />  <br />  ON WISCONSIN!!</p>

It makes some people mean and act in ways you would not if you were sober. I've been there many times in the past. I had someone visit me here and they were amazed at the number of taverns here. To drink socially is one thing but to drink just to get drunk is another. To be recognized for our alcohol consumption is also sad.

As the former Alcohol and other Drug Coordinator in a school system, I saw the damage to children who lived with an alcoholic at home. It is devasating because part of their adaptation is to think their drinking parent's behavior is caused by the child; there is so much shame they don't tell anyone else about it. They suffer until there is an intervention.<br />  <br /> We have been &quot;trained&quot; to think drinking is fun and funny; thank God we have changed the advertising and comic acts that emphasized that. Euphoric recall contributes to the idea that we had a good time last night.<br />  <br /> We need to get tough with our laws; drunk drivers need to enter a tough treatment program similar to what Walworth County is now doing. Jail time alone is not enough because alcoholism is a disease. <br />  <br />  Stop protecting the drunk driver and alcoholic.  The must face what they are doing and enter a tough and thorough program.  <br />  <br />  Let's hold the tavern owners responsible too.<br />  <br />  Thanks and thank you for your series.<br />  </p>

Wisconsin has always been known for drinking and every small town seems to have at least one bar on ever street corner. Other parts of the country don't have the love affair with alcohol as we do. <br />  <br /> Public transportation also cannot work in small towns and outlying areas where the majority of fatal OWI crashes are likely to occur. We need to have mandatory felony charges on the 3 DUI no matter what.

Everyone knows that the majority of serious drinkers are also smokers as well. For them, the two go hand in hand. If you want to see an abatement of drunken driving, public drunkenness, the problem caused by allowing bars in rural areas to begin with, and so forth, ban smoking in bars and on bar property, and you'll see a lot of it go away.</p>

Some got away with it and some didn't.<br /> But the laws HAVE to be consistant for EVERYONE. You can't give one person a 25 year prison sentence for killing someone while driving drunk and give another person a 3 year sentence for the same thing. The law is the law for EVERYONE and the judges MUST put aside their personal feelings if they know the victim in a drunk driving case. Sentencing in a drunk driving case MUST be based on law and not on what a judge FEElS the victim's family would want done just because he might know them. This happens way to often in small communities because everyone knows everyone in the small communities.</p>

One arrest is too many as far as I am concerned. My father and brother were almost killed by a 5 time drunk driver years ago and unfortunatly a woman in that crash did loose her life!<br /> You should have your license taken away and the ability to purchase a vehicle taken too.

From what I have seen, the amount of drinking far exceeds anything I have ever encountered and we have lived in North Dakota, Minnesota and Illinois. I simply cannot believe that someone that has 9 DUI convictions would ever be allowed out of jail not to mention be able to get a valid Wisconsin driver's license. I don't know if more jail time would be the answer. Maybe people need to experience financial hardship instead. No more work release, have to report all DUI's including misdemeanors on applications (work, housing), huge fines $5,000+ for 1st offense and mandatory community service 500+ hours. This might sound preachy but you should know that I got a DUI in Minnesota 5+ years ago. I learned from my mistake and chose to quit drinking completely. Based on some of the statistics out there most people are not making that choice and it is costing innocent lives and taxpayer dollars.</p>

With the second offense, the vehicle COULD be forfeited to MADD or AA to be sold. If there is insuance coverage for the vehicle, the insurance money would have to be forfeited. With a third or more offenses, it WOULD be forfeited.<br />  <br /> Would you let a potential intoxicated driver use your vehicle now? Would you risk driving intoxicated yourself if you would lose your vehicle?</p>

It's part of the culture and I like it that way and so does pretty much everyone else I know from there.<br />  <br /> .08 is a ridiculously low standard-no Wisconsinite worth a damn is impaired enough not to drive at that level. This standard is clearly so low so as to enhance revenue and placate MADD idiots. Having said that, drinking and driving is stupid if only for the financial consequences and public transit really is a good thing that Wisconsin has far too little of. Few people drink and drive down here in Chicago and yet we drink just as much as Wisconsinites. We just have cabs and trains to take afterwards.</p>

As a recovering &quot;binge drinker&quot;, I have had the opportunity to be around a high percentage of drunks, except we are now ex-drunks. Life can be good without alcohol. I had a friend in florida (I was still drinking when there) and he said to me, do you always have to have a beer in your hand! Many other examples and stories I could tell, but 1 stands out most for me, heard from a confidential but trustworthy source:<br /> On any given night on a Milwaukee street 1 out of every 3 drivers is drunk! This was a few(maybe 10) years ago, so maybe that has changed, but if that isn't an eye opener, I don't know what is.</p>

                                                        <p>Wisconsinites live in a culture where alcohol abuse seems to be not only accepted but supported by a majority of the people. It doesn't seem to matter that families are tragically impacted by some one's negligence, ignorance and lack of respect for others. They get a moderate fine and are cut loose. Rarely do they actually spend any real time in jail. Even when a drunk driver is convicted of vehicular homicide their jail term is light when you stop to consider that the person they killed is dead forever and their family will be impacted by that death forever. <br /> I think what is needed is for the Legislature to pass some really hard laws with equally hard punishment for people who are caught driving DUI. I think vehicular homicide sentences should be on the same par as if the drunk driver had intentionally killed someone with a gun. <br /> Until the punishment for the crime is made to fit the crime, Wisconsinites will continue to drink to excess and think nothing of it. That's a sad commentary on the culture here, but it is what it is and it's time something was done about it.</p>

                                                        <p>Yes and unfortunately it has been part of the WI culture for such a long time that Wisconites accept it as the norm. I grew up and went to college in WI so I admit to participating in many drinkfests. But after I left and moved to other states I realized how my alcohol consumption had dwindled almost to zero because alcohol does not play as an integral part of life as it does in WI. In fact, what I've noticed in many of my return visits is that everything seems to revolve around alcohol in WI. So much so that after a July visit to a church fest I can truly say that even a regular church festival in WI probably serves more beer than a state fair in some other states.</p>

I would like to read informed thoughts on Wisconsin drinking, not complaining about spelling mistakes. If you do not have anything to add, stop wasting our time by trying to make others seem less educated. As far as drinking goes, changes need to be made. Wisconsin needs tougher punishments on first and second time offenders. People need to FEAR getting behind the wheel drunk, if not for the safety reasons, then for the repercussions of the law. First time offenders should spend time in jail hopefully making them reconsider driving drunk again. Even if it only deters a small percentage, lives could be saved.</p>

It's sad when these kids are watching shows like Greek or college party movies that are geared toward this lifestyle sending the message that it's OK to drink in excess. Sure, we had Animal House and other teen movies, but it has to stop somewhere. When you see these socialites at parties &amp; spring break specials it's just gearing these kids up for something that shouldn't be normal. Just like so many of these reality shows. What kind of reality is being portrayed? We live in a right-now society that wants to call in a nanny to fix it all.<br />  <br /> We all want to have fun - life is short &amp; we need to enjoy it, but everything in moderation. You don't see movies on how alcohol poisoning has killed so many kids or how alcohol abuse has ruined families........no fun in that! Take a look at the Intervention shows and see how people's lives are ruined. These are the shows that should be on primetime instead of &quot;Who's smarter than a dancing millionaire making a deal for a bachelorette in a singing competition??<br />  <br /> As this story runs, check around. There are snippets in the news and in the paper about how there will be a new Leinie's flavor and that Zima will no longer be made. I realize Miller is headed up in this town &amp; Leinie's is in WI too, but there are much more newsworthy stories to be told than a blurb on the brand changes or flavors. <br />  <br /> We can't change the world all at one time, but having a little common sense and backing off on things might help? When we really think about it, so much in the media has become so accepted as the norm these days. We should be proud of our state and try to focus on the positive. I don't think it's a major WI problem only. I think it's a social problem throughout the country. Especially with the youth. The ones who belly-up to the bar right from work and on weekends may not be able to change as it's a way of life. I'm sure many of them would secretly agree, but don't know how to change it. Let's try to stop it becoming that way for our future.</p>

Few.

                                                        <p>As a recovering alcoholic, and two time DUI recipient, perhaps I can shed a little light on repeat drunk driving. I have driven drunk hundreds of times - literally - without incident. Even after my second DUI, spending time in jail and lots of attorney fees, it wasn't a deterrant - and for me - even if the punishment were five times the amount - I don't think it would have stopped me from getting behind the wheel after drinking. The way I figure it, I was only caught less than one percent (maybe less than .5%). I'm not advocating driving after drinking, nor am I advocating tougher punishment. I'm not sure what can be done to fix the attitude of someone like me.</p>

                                                        <p>Being in law enforcement allows one to see up close the effects both financially and emotionally that come from intoxicated drivers. You have read and seen this in newspaper articles. A solution has several aspects: <br /> 1. Society's attitude as a whole has to say enough is enough. No it is not society's authority to make someone stop drinking, but over drinking and driving under the influence are still excepted by the social attitude of WI. As a whole, WI's attitude needs to take a harder line on those that over drink and drive intoxicated. <br /> 2. Society needs to communicate to legislature the need to set a minimum penalty, with the appropiate jail time. This so that everyone, courts included, will know exactly what the consquences are. Society needs to communicate to the court system that maximum penalties are meaningless if they are never applied to the offenders.<br />  Society also has to be ready to expect enforcement and stand up for the enforcment of all the laws regarding alcohol.<br /> 3. Society's examples reflect on the youth. Actions speak louder than words. Studies have shown that the amount of drinking at home can have an affect on the children of the home. With WI's current outlook of youth drinking, it is no wonder our college is first in alcohol drinking. <br /> 4.The WI Tavern League also has a big influence in drinking. They need to recognize that no one is trying to take money from the tavern owner's profits, but to make all &quot;servers and sellers&quot; of alcohol accountable for the impact of over drinking and driving under the influence. Every alcohol business has the right to make a profit, but low the seller, server or owner that &quot;cuts&quot; a customer off. That would take away from profits and give the business a bad name.<br />  <br /> So you see the dilema that alcohol use raises and the attitude of a WI person's &quot;right to drink&quot;. The only way to get to the heart of this is by making minimum penalties for all to equally enforce.</p>

                                                        <p>I believe that some of us has a drinking problem. It has been brought up numerous times about the amount of bars we have in comparison to other areas. It has been our culture since way back when, and will also take time to change. As for those whom are seem to disregard the fact and think MADD is overzealous, I have a few words. If you go overseas and get convicted of a DUI, heres some eye openers on sentencing around the globe:<br />  Australia: The names of the drivers are sent to local newspapers and areprinted under the heading &quot;He's Drunk and in Jail.&quot; <br />  <br />  Malaya: The driver is jailed; if he's married, his wife is jailed too. <br />  <br />  South Africa: A 10-year prison sentence and/or the equivalent of a $10,000 fine. <br />  <br />  Turkey: Drunk drivers are taken ten miles from town by the police and forced to walk back under escort. <br />  <br />  Norway: Three weeks in jail doing hard labor, and a one-year loss of license. Second offense and license is revoked for life. <br />  <br />  Finland and Sweden: Automatic jail for one year doing hard labor. <br />  <br />  Costa Rica: Police remove plates from car. <br />  <br />  Russia: License revoked for life. <br />  <br />  England: One-year suspension of license, a $650 fine, and jail for one year. <br />  <br />  France: Three-year loss of license, one year in jail, and a $1,000 fine. <br />  <br />  Poland: Jail, fine, and forced to attend political lectures. <br />  <br />  Bulgaria: A second conviction results in execution. <br />  <br /> El Salvador: This country is unique in that it has absolutely no repeat offenders: drunk driving is punishable by execution by firing squad. <br />  <br /> A little extreme but I think they get the point, don't you? So we have to find a middle ground and keep it what it should be, as not acceptable anymore, not like when you were drunk and the cop would offer to drive you home back in the day.</p>

Take a look at other quality of life indexes here in Wisconsin: college graduation rates, median income, life expectancy, etcetera.. Then ask yourself: would you rather live in Wisconsin or Kentucky, based on these criteria? What I'm trying to say is that Wisconsin gets it RIGHT when it comes to how to . Our culture is GREAT! And that includes the way we drink, have fun, and let people be themselves. <br />  <br /> What needs to happen is for the M.A.D.D. to take a step back from their total temperance crusade (don't let the name fool you - they pressured Texas to send undercover cops into bars to arrest people for being drunk. Drunk in bars! This is not a joke, and they've done similar things in other, weaker states), and attack the real problem: repeat offenders at the wheel of their death machines. I'll paraphrase a great quote from someone in the article about how one DUI is a mistake (especially with the legal b.a.c. limit now down to 0.08), two DUIs is unforgivable and should require a lifestyle change, and three DUIs is violence against society and should be severely punished. I couldn't agree more. Let's attack the real problem, and stop worrying about this myopic non-issue of whether Wisconsin has a &quot;drinking problem&quot; - it's a waste of time.&quot;<br />  <br /> p.s. A suggestion I saw someone else mention: second-hand smoke is so much worse for people, why not tackle that issue instead, eh?</p>

Almost every adult in America has been affected by or knows an alcoholic. It is so difficult to live a normal life in the United States and not be tempted to drink. Yet many adults are quite capable of being responsible social drinkers, however some of us can't drink and shouldn't drink. Some of us have spent too many years drinking. I don't believe that alcoholism is a disease, I believe it is a choice. You either choose to live as a drunk or you choose to live sober. There is no special secret to living clean and sober. <br />  <br /> I have lived this! I almost killed myself in a car accident in 1993. It took me another 12 years to finally &quot;wake up&quot;. I pulled myself out of an unhealthy life as a professional alcoholic. I achieved sobriety on my own terms. I accomplished this without any accredited recovery program. My recovery is based upon personal willpower and making changes within my life FOR OTHER PEOPLE, not for me. My deepest desire is to inspire other drunken nobodies, such as myself, to achieve their own sober existence. I run a website called &quot;Living Sober Sucks&quot; www.LivingSoberSucks.com If people would learn how to live life as a sober person they could get on with their careers, families, businesses and lives. I feel that rehab, A.A. and other recovery programs don't teach people how to live a normal life in a world filled with alcohol and drugs.<br />  <br /> Sobriety is not the panacea that A.A. and many other recovery groups make it out to be. It's not easy and it's not always fun living sober. I am sure that many other healed addicts feel the same way. That is why I started my website - www.LivingSoberSucks.com I speak very openly and honestly about addiction on my site. I am not some temperance lunatic. I am not against drinking, I think people should drink as much as they want to and then face the consequences. I believe that accepting our honest feelings about alcohol will help others to address their demons and embrace living sober.<br />  <br /> I invite any alcoholic or addict to visit my website - www.LivingSoberSucks.com This site is NOT for the timid or bashful, but then neither is being an addict or alcoholic.<br />  <br />  I have been sober for over 3 years, and living sober sucks, however I am glad I made the choice to live sober.<br />  <br />  I would like to thank the Journal Sentinel for running this series.<br />  <br />  Mark.</p>

It could be worse than other states but it's clear there are drinkers all across this land and too many drive under the influence.<br />  <br /> Yes, alcohol is an enjoyable social lubricant but American's obsessive and compulsive love affair with fermented beverages, I think, belies a deeper, more troubling symptom: We all often seek to escape from whatever it is we feel, or feel binds us, traps us, depletes us and enrages us. That can include debt, relationship, illness, sorrow, heck, even happiness can be overwhelming at times. <br />  <br /> What people don't understand, I think, and need to embrace is that drinking is not an activity. It should not be the lone reflexive action at the end of a day or a week or a job or a relationship. If it is, and we have all been there, we know those ends we strove to flee are still there on our shoulder when the alcohol is gone. I know this; I have been there.<br />  <br /> Another aspect that may or may not be touched on in these stories is how devastating alcohol can be between people who say they love one another. It can turn a nice person into a monster in a heartbeat. An out-of- control drunk person who has issues with anger to begin with can just as easily beat or choke a loved one as open another brewski after getting home from a night of drinking elsewhere. The result of this is terribly destructive secrets, tons of them, kept behind many a front door in this country.<br />  <br /> Even if you don't go crazy with drinking, I challenge everyone to try not drinking for a few months. See what happens, see what you get done at home, see what drinking people say about your not drinking. It will open your eyes.</p>

                                                        <p>Yes, many people in Wisconsin do have a drinking problem. I think it's due to social pressure from friends for a lot of people. Nobody wants to be called a wimp or a party-pooper. Also, it's the irresponsible thinking that if we can walk, we can drive. Yes, it's fun to get a little silly with friends. However, let's be responsible and take turns on being the designated so driver so everyone can have their &quot;silly&quot; night, if they need it. I like the idea of orange license plates for those caught drinking and driving for at least 1 year. I'd love to have every person turning 21 attend a session where they have to read newspapers articles of DWI accidents with photos attached. That would be costly and difficult to set up. Possibly we should mandate that every senior in high school (with their parents) attend a similar session and have a young spokesperson attend their school who lost a friend or relative due to drunken driving. Or, have anyone renewing their license have to They have to realize there are other people at risk too.</p>

                                                        <p>This state definitely has a drinking problem. When I was growing up north of Green Bay, one of the next door neighbor's sons was killed by a drunk driver. The person was only 21. He had just gotten married and his wife was expecting.<br />  <br />  I remember thinking what a complete waste of life.  He should've lived for years and years.  <br />  <br /> And the other thing that really was sickening was that the drunk driver wasn't punished that much. Plus he got out of jail on the Huber Law. I don't really think the whole incident makes an impact on the drunk driver whereas the victim's family and friends don't have the same luxury.</p>

Other states don't have alcohol as readily available, especially at the county zoo. You would think that people who grow up with alcohol such a prevalent part of every day life would learn to have a better tolerance, but it appears not. Has anyone thought of having a designated driver when they'll be out drinking? It may deaden the party for the DD, but it makes everyone safer. Just something to think about.</p>

                                                        <p>I think Wisconsin has a huge drinking problem. In addition to the costs related to drunk driving and detox, there are many costs to families and neighborhoods. <br /> My job at UW Law School provides me with the opportunity to analyze lots of cases of prison inmates, sentencing, etc. There are trememdous percentages of crimes and revoked probations/paroles due to prior abuse of alcohol. While we set out policing strategies to observe/arrest for non-alcohol drug crimes, our state ignores the potential of permitting law enforcement to set up safety stops and, instead, we have to wait until someone goes off the road.<br /> I would suggest that Wisconsin's Governor set a target of being below the national median regarding percentage of traffic deaths due to alcohol and also set up a combined strategy of increasing beer tax to at least the national median and also authorizing safety stops.</p>

                                                        <p>The problem comes particularly with these people who think that rules/laws don't apply to them and that they can keep being irresponsible without worrying about anything happening to them as a result. This includes drunk drivers, people who start fights when drunk, who assault others when drunk, all of it. There should be no reason why someone is able to get away with nine drunk driving incidents and still be out on the streets, getting hammered and making light of it. These people aren't going to be affected by more laws--they're already disregarding the ones that exist. <br />  <br /> So how about a bit of humiliation treatment? When someone is pulled over for drunk driving the first time, yank their license plates and replace them with blaze orange ones so police officers and other drivers KNOW who's already been caught driving drunk and can react appropriately on the road. Do the same with their drivers' license so bartenders and liquor store owners know full out what kind of a person they're dealing with. I guarantee you this will serve as a deterrent to at least some of the population...nobody wants their family and the general random population to know they're a fall-down drunk with no regard for the lives of others, and it might help bartenders realize it's time to stop serving them a bit quicker than they would otherwise.</p>

I&rsquo;m not sure I have the right to say much yet about the problem. Before moving up here, I lived in St. Louis for most of my life. I thought STL was a beer town and could pound down the brews. Hah! Milwaukee and WI makes STL look like amateurs. However, I do have a wife and children and it concerns me greatly about their safety on the road with so many drunks out there. I just wonder if somewhere up in Madison the state legislators have a spreadsheet that specifies after &quot;X&quot; number of deaths due to drunk drivers, the state will actually make some enforceable laws to put the repeat offenders in jail. In my opinion, after 3 offenses / 3 strikes, you are out. Make it a mandatory 10 year jail sentence.<br />  <br />  For now, keep your head up, drive defensively and keep your fingers crossed you don't cross paths with a drunk.<br />  </p>

I thought it was cool to drink and drive then and did so until one night I fell asleep at the wheel after a night of drinking, left the road and slammed into a telephone pole destroying my car and breaking several bones. The only redeeming factor was that I did not injure anyone but myself. The police officer that came to the scene said I was extremely lucky to be alive and that instance changed me forever because I have not had a drink since. That policeman and the judge that handled the case placed the fear of God in me and I have not had a drink since. Too bad that judge, is not around today he was sobering in his beratement of me and what would happen if I continued. His words are with me today. I have found that I can enjoy everything this state and the country has to offer without being drunk. The problem existed then as it does now and no amount of deaths related to drinking has changed anything. Our state has &quot;wallowed&quot; in the reputation as being the biggest drinkers in the country and are very proud of that &quot;title&quot;. To change that we need to change the glamour of drinking just as Judge O'Mera did to me. Perhaps it was easier to scare in the 60's than now but I thank him each and everyday for giving me all the &quot;what if's&quot; during my day in court. I sincerely hope that your series of articles wakes up our legislature, police and judges to the point that the Tavern League of Wisconsin is about as powerful as a wet noodle. We do not need an association of people that do not have feelings for all the innocent people that have been affected by a drunk driver or drinking in general and continue to lobby that their position is the right one and the rest of people are all wrong on drinking.</p>

Taverns line Wisconsin highways. I've even seen beer sold, with bottle and can openers on the counter, in filling stations. It is baffling: fill up the gas tank in the car and the alcohol level in the driver? Where are our legislators? The penalties are too light for a first DWI: the message with a slap on the wrist is that the offense really isn't so bad. The first offense signals a dangerous use of alcohol and the offender needs all the help he or she can get to confront any denial of the reality that, if not already alcoholic, that line may be looming closefor them.</p>

                                                        <p>I'm curious about what is considered 'binge drinking' ? Does the usage of the term mean that Wisconsinites confine their drinking to the weekends and then does it hardily while the rest of the country drinks consistently over the entire week?<br />  I find it hard to believe that Kentucky, Tennesse and West Virginia are among the lowest in the nation.</p>

No problem if we had any kind of justice system in place in this backwards state of good ole WIsconsin.<br /> Maybe as I said: the rest of the country is right! We are so backwards as to be lenient when a motorist kills our children and family members? NO room in our prison system for second;third time offenders? I am not buying that.<br />  I say bring back the the chain gang; let them work on the roads where they have, or will likely, someday kill someone.</p>

Journal tries to take our minds elsewhere by glorifying an issue that is as old as dirt!!! Give me a break, alcohol has been around forever and will always be a part of our culture. If you stop and think about the amount of people who consume alcohol vs. the amount of alcohol related incidents, that leaves a huge majority of us who are RESPONSIBLE DRINKERS. This is no different than the gun argument. There isn't a &quot;problem&quot; in this state as a whole, it's the irresponsible idiots who drink to get drunk that bring out the activists the moment a tragedy occurs. I am proud of living in this state, and have no problem with how we are perceived in relation to consumption, be it in the awesome college town of Madison or the northwoods. Milw.

I left my house one day on 48th and Center after a number of beers, went to the liquor store to get more and when I left, I didn't know how to get home. I headed west on capital drive and got pulled over once I was in Brookfield. It was a real wake up call and I have been clean ever since. This was 2 days after my boss at work was pulled over doing 16mph on the freeway after drinking. This really helped me realize I needed to clean up my act. I have been clean for 3 months and plan to keep going. Fred Banks, Watson Jr High, class of 81</p>

However, the State's drunk driving laws are terribly inadequate and should be much harsher. 2-time offenders should permanently lose their licenses and 3-time offenders should go to jail for at least 3 years. There needs to be a real deterrent to the multiple offenders. I think drinking is fine but drunk driving is unacceptable.</p>

Wisconsin just exhibits their nihilistic tendencies with alcohol as a form of escapism from the way their lives have been lived thusfar. For younger drunken individuals it is pure recklessness mired in a sort of belief in their own immortality. Older people who should know better have basically &quot;given up&quot; on any kind of better life for themselves without the abuse of alcohol. They've relegated themselves to their current state of being. <br /> Ultimately, the origins of it are derived from a poor educational system up and down the line that indoctrinates people with nonsense, promotes immoral behavior and leads them to the cesspool of drugs &amp; alcohol. The other part is a government that impedes in their life to the point where they feel they have no say any longer. There are no true incentive(s) from government to better themselves. As people lose their dignity, they lose their hope and hit the bottle. Where have we seen this before? Ah.. The old, evil empire that was the Soviet Union which we are quickly morphing ourselves into in complete re-animation. The citizenry of the Soviet Union binged on Vodka day in and day out, and they held the same kinds of questions like has been asked in this forum. <br /> Of course, maybe I'm wrong.. Maybe everyone just drinks and gets completely blotto because the Brewers lost and the Packers lost Brett Favre.</p>

                                                        <p>I believe Wisconsin had a repeat offender drunk driving problem and maybe a binge drinking problem. Like most Wisconinites, I was a binge drinker, until it started ruining my whole next day with a hangover.<br /> I have lived in Arizona for the past 15 years, and have spent time in other major cities. The binge drinking is almost as prevalent among college kids and adults in their 20s in areas like Tempe and Scottsdale, AZ, Atlanta, SoCal, and Chicago as it is here. However, the difference I see here is folks in their 30's, 40's, 50's continue this trend, instead of limiting it to 2-3 drinks. When you're 20 something it can be funny, but when you're 40 something it looks pathetic. I'm in my 30's and my AZ friends and I would go out for a few glasses of wine or one martini, instead of sitting in a local tavern for 3-4 hours guzzling beer. In addition, it amazes me how drunk drivers are still on the road after 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. offenses. Arizona has significantly cracked down on this in the past ten years. It hasn't necessarily changed the culture among younger adults, but it definately has changed everyone's mindset about planning your transportation before going out on the weekend. I'll be willing to bet those that think Wisconsin doesn't have a problem have not lived anywhere else...the other posts from those that lived elsewhere backs this up.</p>

                                                        <p>WI absolutely has a drinking problem...legislation won't help/fix it...only a cultural shift through education can really cure it. I've seen too many parents who think nothing of taking their underage children to events and not only encouraging them to drink, but also underage friends they've brought along. I'm not against a little taste now and then...but to watch your underage kids get drunk (for the sake of fun???) is too much. Jump ahead to older adults who should know better...I have co-workers over age 50 showing up at work &quot;proud&quot; of their latest weekend drinking escapades and their headaches that followed. Now tell me these aren't signs of problem drinking.</p>

                                                        <p>Yes, I think this state has a drinking problem. I agree with most of the comments I have read and feel that our enforcement of existing law and prosecution of repeat offenders is lax at best. Repeat offenders should pay a hefty price for their offense whether it be time behind bars, loss of their driving privileges or monetary fines. All of which should escalate as the number of offenses grows.</p>

                                                        <p>There is definately a drinking problem in Wisconsin. I moved here from Chicago a couple of years ago and I was absolutely floored when I realized how much drinking was part of the culture here. In Illinois, for the most part, we had designated drivers or took cabs if we were out drinking. In Wisconsin, it's the opposite. I was so surprised to see how many people here drive drunk. It really is part of the culture here and quite frankly, it's disturbing. I've made many comments to my Milwaukean husband about it and he thinks that I'm just over reacting. Not so much. In Illinois if you get a DUI it's a felony right off the bat. Five DUIs for a felony???? You've got to be kidding me. I like to party too but at what cost?</p>

                                                        <p>I truly believe the culture surrounding not only drinking, but binge drinking, is most prevalent in Wisconsin. I came from Minnesota to go to college in Milwaukee and I have never (and i'm no spring chicken) seen drinking glorified to the exetent that Milwaukee does. What do you do on holidays? Drink. What do you do before/during/after a major sports event? Drink. What do you do after work? Drink. Although it may seems that I am harping on this state or singling it out, I'm not-- I just notice a trend in Wisconson where drinking--and drinking hard, is the norm. Being in college, drinking is now an obvious part of the experience here. I partake in the activities, but not to the extent that I've seen throughout the last 4 years living in Milwaukee. Milwaukee flat out just loves to drink-- and totally and wholeheartedly embraces that culture unlike any other region in the country....and i believe it shows every weekend on water street, every Brewers gamr, and in the bad news (DUI's ,accidental deaths) that shows up in the paper each morning.</p>

I'm only half joking when talking with people outside the state when I say that drunken driving is darn near a right of passage in this state. Yes, I'm just as guilty of drunken driving as many Wisconsinites are; although those days are far behind me. I was just lucky in that I never got into any accidents or hurt anyone. They need to have MUCH tougher laws out there for this.</p>

If a person is caught the SECOND time for drunk driving (and hopefully nobody got killed), require mandatory jail time and take their car away for good. People continue to drive after they received their little &quot;slap&quot; on the hand because, in the end, they still have their car. Take the car away and donate to the Boys Ranch or other charities.</p>

Between my job transfers and my military service I have lived in 12 different states. Truthfully, no other area I've lived in the USA drinks like they do in Wisconsin. Sure every area has their drunks&hellip;.. Wisconsin just has a lot more of them.<br />  <br /> After being gone 10 years we came back to live in Milwaukee for 18 months. But, one of the main topics of conversation and considerations regarding our thoughts of returning was: Do we really want to start drinking like we use to again? We decided to return and yes, we did start the heavy drinking again. Why? Everyone does it and you are expected to, when you socialize with your friends. We have moved elsewhere again for the last 22 years. But return often for visits.<br />  <br /> Heavy drinking is European tradition and we picked up in Wisconsin from our ancestors probably because of long winters. Heavy drinking exists in all the countries of Europe and that's their bad tradition. A bad Wisconsin tradition that should end for everyone's safety.<br />  <br /> Don't think there is a drinking problem in Wisconsin? Just go to a local tavern or sporting event, pro or amateur or go a wedding.... Lots of Drunks at both and they are of all ages from kids to gramps....and don&rsquo;t leave out granny! It&rsquo;s scary at times! And the offenders are proud of it. They're not drunk&hellip;.. believe me, they can hold their liquor &hellip;&hellip;..just ask them!!<br />  </p>

There are people who have drinking problems but in general the state does not have a drinking problem. <br />  I falls on personal responsibility. A person who wants to drink and drive will drink and drive. <br /> I feel that the state needs to educate the kids at a young age 14-16 years old. Parents need to reinforce that message at home as well. <br /> And finally if they have more than one OWI or DUI than they need to head to prison for a couple of months after the 2nd offense and the sentences should get longer from there.<br />  <br />  </p>

But, when we see a pattern, and in this case we now know a second offense is clear indication that a pattern is developing, our culture's failure to act NOW and strongly is a feat only an Ostrich could out-do.<br />  <br /> Licenses should be seized. Cars should be seized, prison should be mandatory. And if ever a collision occurs, the door should slam immediately.</p>

There seems to be such hatred towards OWI offenders which is understandable given the terrible tragedies that are involved. However, it is easy for most of us to overlook time when we had a few at a relatives house, family gathering, after work get together or a weekend sports party. All it takes is one or two drinks to be charged OWI. The legal limmit is .08, but if it can be proved that skills were diminished due to any level of substance in your body, you can be charged. Just ask the youg girl from about 8-9 years ago in Waukesha that killed one or two kids in a side swipe. She was under .08. Be cautious of the glass house effect and try to help solve the problem like call a local bar and offer to give rides to patrons. Many bars I know claim to pay and call for cabs, and never do to save a buck.</p>

I believe we should allow one DUI charge and then if caught driving drunk a second time and automatic felony charge with prison time, confiscation of the vehicle that was be driven at the time, no matter who owned the vehicle, and life time loss of license. <br />  <br /> The problem is our elected representatives.

                                                        <p>Yes Wisconsin has a drinking problem - so does the reat of the US. Sooner or later, people will realize that you cannot legislate attitudes, only actions. We need to start developing in our children anunderstanding of the place that alcoholic drinks have IN our society, not just ON it. Making it taboo until 18 or 21 only glorifies the issue inthe minds of the young adults finally old enough to drink. Just look at the level of alcohol on our college campuses to understand that the real need is to educate not legislate. Will this solve the problem _ NO; but it surely reduce it. There will always be the idiot that cannot learn from mistakes and then repeats. Throwing these jerks in jail may get them off the streets for a finite period of time, but it doesn't solve their problem. EDUCATE DON'T JUST LEGISLATE.</p>

The simple fact is that innocent people who die because a drunk kills them don't vote. Drunks who repeatedly plead down to misdemeanors will continue to vote.<br />  <br />  Confiscate a car, imprison those caught driving after license revocation, and don't allow pleading to a lesser offense.  <br />  <br /> If we really wanted to go down the road of prevention, we could engineer cars that only start after a breathalyzer.

I am from California and have never seen as many drunks as I have here. It's almost a daily occurence. Perhaps instead of having patrols out to catch speeding motorists the county should heavily increase patrols to address the safety of all drivers on our roads.

The fact is you will never stop the idiots who drink too much from wanting to get in their car(or should I say weapon?) and heading out on the road putting innocent people in danger. Why hasn't someone come up with a device that would prevent anyone with a blood alcohol above the legal limit from ever being able to start the car. This device should be mandatory for EVERY single car that is sold in the United States. Any older car would be required to have the device installed in order to get a license renewal. This would prevent any drunk- first time offender or ten time offender- from getting on the road drunk, period! End of drunk drivers! Think of the lives that would be spared and the relief our criminal justice system would have not having to deal with idiot drunk drivers.</p>

It is also the REAL &quot;gateway&quot; drug, partially because it is socially acceptable, mostly because it is readily available. Growing up in Milwaukee (a city with a professional sports team with an alcohol related name) drinking was something to do, something incorporated into other activities. Grilling out - &quot;miller time&quot;. Tailgating - &quot;miller time&quot;. watching sports, after a hard days work, after a ride on the mountain bike, during a round of golf, wed. night softball . . . MILLER TIME! i stopped drinking after my 4th DUI, fortunate that i never harmed anyone with a vehicle. When sober, i knew drinking and driving was dangerous and stupid. After a few drinks, it didn't seem so dangerous. i personally like driving more than drinking, and could not continue to do both.</p>

It made me think of an older study that showed some place claming to be on of the soberest cities but they were selling more beer per capita than we did.<br />  <br /> Makes we wonder when polled do people here lie up their drinking because they think is cool and do others lie down their drinking because they know its not?<br />  <br />  In any case and its just what I see people all over drink to much and to often<br />  <br />  </p>

The man that killed her was recently sentenced to 10 years in prison. <br />  <br /> My opinion is, why is everyone focusing on repeat offenders? This man had no prior drunk driving offenses, but he did kill my daughter. If only we could focus on how we are going to stop the driving drunk the first time there would be no other offenses. We have laws in place, they are not always enforced. We had a very smart Judge for the trial and sentencing. <br />  Judge Robert Wirtz from Fond du Lac.<br />  But it doesnt change what happened.<br />  <br />  My wish is that there would be prevention of drunk driving rather than how do we treat repeat offenders.<br />  I will carry that banner.<br />  <br />  </p>

                                                        <p>Wisconsin has a drinking problem and we all seem to be proud of it. UW gets the moniker of &quot;best party school in the US&quot; and some treat it as a badge of honor. I heard stories of bars and liquor stores in Pasadena drunk dry by Badger fans during one of the Rose Bowls. This was communicated as not being a bad things but a great accomplishment. We are initiated early in our teens. Drinking is cool, parties were cool and to be cool you had to drink. And if you drank a lot, you could talk about how much you drank the next school day. My junior year in high school a classmate died choking on his own vomit due to excessive drinking. What did we do, we toasted him. Drinking is part of everything we do, everywhere we go. It's hard to think of an event, outing, function that does not include alcohol: parties, holidays, sporting events, picnics, boating, golf, hunting, fishing, weddings, funerals, girls night out, happy hours etc. With our Germanic heritage, Wisconsinites are legacy consumers of beer and are indoctrinated into the world of alcohol as an early age. I am not immune to this world as I have been a drinker since 16 and received a DUI in 2000. It's hard not succumb to the persuasion of the drinking world. You may not even like the taste of alcohol, but drink to fit in. There is no excuse for drinking and driving. I was lucky enough not to have hurt anyone of myself. Beyond the guilt of doing it, it cost me about $5000.00 all told including a hike in insurance. I could have called a limo and rode home in style for about 1/50th of that.</p>

You are able to drive somewhere, a bar most of the time, and drink tilabout 2 in the morning. people dont sleep or stay at the bars over night, which i always had thought, why the hell is it this way? I would think it would be much more responsible for sokmeone to go buy alcohol til about 10 at night, but to go drinking somewhere and thne have to drive home, i dont understand. It seems to be a bit backwards, but whatever..</p>

Use those cell phones!! I know of a few routine drunk drivers -- people who drink and drive nightly. Sober or drunk, they never want to talk about what's really going on. Instead they tend to blame the stress of their jobs, their miserable relationships, the police for picking on them, the world for being unfair. One such friend told me he was leaving his nightly watering hole when he tripped on the way to his car, smashing his glasses and breaking his nose. A bloody mess, he managed to stagger back into the bar, where his drinking buddies cleaned him up the best they could. Although he got a ride home that night, a few days later he was back in the saddle, keys in hand. Rather than see what could happen on the road, he prefers to joke about the fact that the bar now keeps a first-aid kit on hand. It's only a matter of time before a fatality makes the news in St. Francis...<br />  </p>

                                                        <p>YES! Wisconsin definately has a HUGE drinking mindset.  <br />  <br /> I don't care if you drink but don't drink and drive. But, it is the mindset around here. &quot;Oh, I had 3 drinks I'm alright to go.&quot; I've heard so many excuses and enough is enough. I know there are responsible people in this state, many are...but with everything there are exceptions. I used to work with someone who worked as a delivery driver with a pizza company. I know one time they were driving home drunk, ran a stop sign, and had their pizza sign lit so they wouldn't get pulled over. <br />  <br /> Police also need to do tests more so than they usually do. One of my best friends was killed because of a drunk driver at around 7am on a Friday morning. He was on his way to school and I guess the police officers decided to not give the man a breath test. That evening, the man who killed my friend was going around telling people he had come from a party that morning and was driving drunk. He recieved a failure to yield ticket and went on with his life.<br />  <br /> I know this doesn't happen with everyone but I think the attitude is huge. If the mindset would change habits like heavy drinking and drunk driving would go down.</p>

State takes posession of the vehicle.<br />  <br /> 2. The DUI's License is entered into a database and it becomes a 1 year mandatory jail sentence to sell/provide alcohol to this person during the entire sentence (including probation time).<br />  <br /> 3. Any place that sells alcohol must swip all driver licenses (much like a credit card). Nothing comes up for people who are not in the system. For people convicted, only the date in which alcohol could be sold would appear (alleviating privacy issues).<br />  <br />  </p>

We were at a retirement party for her work, there was a keg of beer, the plastic cups by it were only six ounces each, and the beer quickly ran out and no one bothered to get another keg.

                                                        <p>I have been reading some of the responses on here since my first post. The thing that jumps out at me is how so many people are so quick to find a place to place blame. Who cares how many bars there are (almost every corner in some neighborhoods). Beer ads and the venues that are supported by liqour companies surround us all. If you stand by and watch someone you know loose control, then you are just part of the problem. There is no better way to &quot;fix&quot; the problem than to take an active roll in that person's life that has the problem. For some people it is more than just sad, it's pathetic. We have choices to make, get them the help they need urgently, or lock the repeat offenders away and forget about them. My life and the life of those around me is too precious. Join MADD or lobby your representatives to get offenders off the road.</p>

Pulling mangled bodies out cars, holding on to people's hands as they pray for the pain to stop or for me to help, and telling loved ones that someone they know is dead or severly injured from a drunk driver is part of the job as a police officer. <br />  <br /> Some drunk drivers are mad at me for arresting them, like driving a 1000 lb car isn't endangering other lives. Others have a sad realization when they see how high their BAC is. When you drink for years and your tolerance gets higher you don't realize how wasted you are.<br />  <br />  Personal responsibility is the key when it comes to drinking and driving.</p>

Sure, Americans love their beer and wine just as much as any other country, but in Wisconsin, it just seems different somehow. Even though drinking to the point of becoming wasted is somewhat of a college right of passage, our state exacerbates it somehow. I guess it's our history of brewing and lack of a majorly big city with that much to do. U of Wisconsin has constantly ranked #1 or 2 for big party schools in the nation. We have more bars per capita than any other city. UW-Milwaukee's off campus parties are out of control with illegal taverns and upset neighbors. Girls getting drugged and date raped is a major consequence of these parties and binge drinking, not to mention the drunk driving accidents and deaths. Lack of a good public transportation system also makes the drunk driving worse, making many people feel that they have no option but to drive even if drunk.</p>

Cause all you hear in the news is somebody is getting run over by drunk drivers.Not only that, They're sentence is not even fair. Why do drunk driver could go around killing innocent people and our state just locked them up for a few years or even get bail out. It's the family who are suffering for they're love ones. Why do innocent people have to go through this,Our state need to protect the innocent ones, not the drunk drivers.</p>

                                                        <p>I believe that Wisconsin as a whole has a drinking problem. Regardless if you are in the ''boondocks'' or in the city...it actually starts with the bartender, the person with the liscense who sells the alcohol. The bartender, though there might be a lot of customers, they should be liable as well. over serving is an ongoing problem. We try to glamourize the idea of getting wasted at the bar. this is a problem that the bartender allows to happen. The laws in Wisconsin, and within each county, should be enforced and become more strict. When someone is pulled over on a DWI, they usually have driven under the influence, so its an on going problem.</p>

                                                        <p>Absolutely! I moved to Wisconsin in 1970 (I was in my late 20's at the time), and I had never seen a place where there was so much drinking going on. It was (and is) almost impossible to have any kind of event without having at beer and LOTS of it. I'm not a beer drinker (I don't like the taste), but I'm not a teetotaler either. I don't like being around drunks, and I cringe at the thought of driving around Milwaukee with all the drunks out there behind the wheel. It's one reason I only go to day games at Miller Park &amp; sit in the family section with no alcohol allowed.<br /> People need to wake up &amp; realize it is possible to have fun (and remember it) without being drunk. And for heaven's sake, STOP DRIVING IF YOU HAVE BEEN DRINKING!!!</p>

You have serious problems if you even have to ask that question. Open up your eyes and look around sometime. I spent the first nineteen years of my life in Milwaukee before moving to Las Vegas twelve years ago. I'll tell you what, drinking isn't the only big problem Wisconsin has. That's a different story for a different time. As far as the drinking goes, as a late teen I spent alot of my time drinking. Go to a party...drink. Go to a ball game...drink. Go to Summerfest...drink. Sitting at home....drink. Go out to eat....drink. Nothing to do...guess what? Now I live in Sin City where the alcohol's free when you gamble in the casino and I like to gamble. You can buy it at grocery or convience stores twenty-four hours a day. Guess what? I drink more in a week long trip back to Milwaukee to visit family than I do in a year living in V-Town. That's no exaggeration either. I'll go months without taking a sip of alcohol here. <br />  <br /> Some will say there's nothing else to do in Wisconsin. I agree that's part of the reason. I think the biggest reason is the combination of not much to do along with the fact there's so many taverns and liquor stores it's unbelievable. I would guess businesses in Vegas outnumber businesses in Milwaukee 10-1. I would be willing to bet taverns in Milwaukee outnumber taverns in Vegas 15-1. There's a few more things to do in Vegas than in Wisconsin. And to me that has alot to do with it. As well as the fact that it's passed on from generation to generation. People who live in Wisconsin are generally from Wisconsin. It's the exact opposite in Vegas.<br />  <br /> Remember to drink responsibly and it won't be as serious of an issue. When you drink and get behind the wheel, that is inexcusable. If you want to drink yourself to death, sure you're hurting your loved ones but at least you know them and they know you. Destroying the lives of complete strangers because of your carelessness is downright wrong.</p>

These people drinking and driving can not think and I want to know why the bartenders are not held responsible? So you pull the keys. Chances are they are most likely to drunk to remember 90% of the conversation any way. We just saw in the paper how a fool bypassed the ignition lock. That is desperation. It is a weekly thing to see people with 2 or more offenses busted for drunk driving. Issue is the innocent are getting hurt.</p>

Where can you go for a family outing without having beer at the very least for sale? Do we need it at every event? <br /> Most people cannot see a ball game, go to the zoo, a child's birthday party, a picnic, Christmas, 4th of July or any other Holiday without having alcohol. It's insane.

Hunting, snowmobiling, weddings, camping, Summerfest, concerts, and what seems like thousands of other festivals are all big boozin events. Brewers, Packers, and Badgers games are huge drinking events as well not just at the stadiums but in bars around the state. Weddings, birtdays, company picnics, and holidays. The list goes on. The long, cold winters where outside activities are limited also seem to cause a sort of &quot;cabin fever&quot; that makes people rush out to party at the bars.</p>

                                                        <p>Absolutely. If I were to walk into a crowded business and recklessly wave around a handgun, odds are pretty good that I'd serve at least a minimal about of time in jail. And yet, we continually allow repeat offender (with 4-6 offenses) get off without jail time for endangering lives with a weapon that is every bit as dangerous as a loaded firearm. <br />  <br /> Our drinking problem is that our legislators won't give our law enforcement professionals and judges the help and the guidance that they need to incarcerate habitual offenders. Drinking and driving once is a stupid, stupid mistake. Doing it twice it simply a lack of regard for the lives of those around you.<br />  <br /> My suggestion, a first offense results in a fine equal to 2% of your prior year's earned income. Second offense, revocation of the vehicle for sale at public auction and no less than 7 days in County. Extreme? Perhaps, but it might cut down on those that don't see the harm in the offense.</p>

I used to hang around people from a crowd that I can no longer stand to be around, mostly because all they can ever find to do is get drunk. They blame it on being young and nothing else to do, but I've also heard them say that they live close to Milwaukee and Miller, so it's awesome to drink the beer they make. I've got news for you all, I'm from down south really close to Anheiser Busch, and I'm not a complete drunk. I just dont understand why and how their are so many drunk drivers? Why would the law allow this? Is this what our hard earned tax dollars are going towards? I'm sick of hearing about somebody getting their 5th 6th or 7th DUI, put them in jail after the first one! Why is this so hard to conceive? It's illegal to drink and drive. Does this mean I can rob banks several times and just get probation? I highly doubt it.</p>

It was addictive to them. I believe we, in Wisconsin, drink to pass the time.</p>

For one; its your lefty Judges who are enabling the repeat offenders in OWI and other crimes as well. <br /> 2. In rural Wisconsin, we take care of and look out for each other. Our towns aren't so dangerous that we are afraid to walk home from the bar and if we were too drunk to walk, someone sober would get us home. All of your do-gooder, college educated, know-it-all thinking can't even make for a street safe enough to walk home on in your two cities. 99% of all of the crime and prison inmates come from Madison and Milwaukee and we are sick of footing the bill for your disfunctional cities. Fix your own cities first then maybe you'll have some credibility with the rest of the state. <br /> 3. Alcoholism is a disease of both mind and body. If you don't address both, you will never see a change in behaviors. I have been in recovery for nearly 18 years,(1 OWI no accidents)and I can tell you first hand your collective wills will not stop people from drinking or drinking and driving. Sending someone to prison will help, jail will not. I have met thousands of people in work release at meetings, rarely do they change. I have met hundreds who have spent time in prision for repeat offenses of OWI and they get sober. People who are alcoholics need to hit their bottom and hit it hard to get recovery. <br />  <br /> My last point is this, look at the statistics, vehicle accidents resulting in injuries or deaths are caused by distracted drivers, road rage and OWI. If you want to make a real difference, get serious with all of these factors. Your two cities rig all of the state and national elections, put some people in there who will actually do something for a change instead of blowing smoke up our keisters. <br />  <br />  Chris in the Boondocks</p>

As a lifetime resident of Wisconsin, I have been surrounded by the drinking culture of our state. I have been reading the articles and statistics brought forth in them.<br />  <br /> I believe the sad element that underlies it all is the fact that we have many alchoholics in our state. I would bet that a large percentage of the repeat offenders being arrested are indeed alchoholics in need of treatment.<br />  <br /> What can be done? There are treatments available, but if the person does not go voluntarily, what is their motivation? Apparently not even being incarcerated repeatedly. I hope and pray that at least a few of the drinking drivers wake up, admit their problem and seek help. The way I see it, the laws can't be severe enough in dealing with this problem.</p>

Got a problem get help, not make excuses. Drinking and driving doesn&rsquo;t affect just the driver but everyone that might be on the road. <br /> That &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen to me&rdquo; philosophy is cheep but life isn&rsquo;t.

How about giving people a feasible alternative to drinking and driving like light rail? I myself am not a drinker and most of my friends who do get a ride home with me or take a cab. Our prisons and jails in Wisconsin are already full of thieves, murders, and drug dealers why don't we put away all of the hard working Wisconsinites who like to have a beer after work too.... I'm not defending drinking and driving because its absolutely avoidable especially in the larger cities. We need to give people alternatives to driving and penalties that don't ruin someones life. <br />  <br /> And my far out comment... If people want to drink and drive make it legal to drive below .15 on a scooter with a bright orange safety vest and full pads at least then they will only be able to injure themselves and wont be going over 30mph</p>

                                                        <p>oh yeah, definetly. Wisconsin laws are not stiff enough to punish the person accused of drunk driving. They just keep on doing it. Too many bars along the way home. If someone wants to drink, do it at home, just like they do in Arkansas, there are very few bars in that state. Maybe in other states too, but when I went to Arkansas, I was younger and wanted to go to bars to drink. None were available, now I see why. And to steve in milwaukee, Wisconsins laws are the problems to drunk driving, not the driver. Wisconsin's laws do not take drunk driving seriously enough. Every time are read about multiple owi's I am appalled the first time is not enough. If people have problems controlling their drinking it is because of wis. laws!!!!!!</p>

The problem is this, drunks love to drink because they drive really junkie cars and this depresses them. Ever see a drunks car before the crash? They got no tail lights, no muffler, a cracked windshield, no brakes, over 100,000 miles, bald tires, rust holes, fast food bags piled on the dashboard, yup, a rolling garbage can time bomb, just like the jerk behind the wheel. They got no money for a good car cause they throw it all over the bar to get drunk. It's a viscous circle. Now, just add a drunk to this rolling germ mobile and you got a train wreck. Guy can't see out, can't hear a horn, can't stop. You do the math. Yeh drunks kill people because they choose to drive piece of crap cars thus increasing the odds they'll crash into somebody or something else. Plus they're depressed and just don't care to live. I've got a cure. If you drive a car like I've just described the authorities should be able to arrest you on sight, take you and your car to the crusher and bury you in it. Problem solved.</p>

People do not change drinking habits until they face consequences and sometimes not even then. The judges that are not tough on sentencing are fooling themselves. What WI really needs is a Alcohol and Drug prison where not only are the convicted serving time but also getting the treatment they need. You only need to look at the impirical evidence available to kow that treatment is the only thing that works. That being said I do not think enough of the convicted take treatment serious enough to be trusted on their own, that is why we need prison and treatment to coincide. There has to consequences along with compassion. These people do have a disease. Whether you believe that or not is your own decision, but I know from people I know that treatment works better than incarceration, however some of those people would not have sought treatment unless they were incacerated. We need a little of each.</p>

In fact, they used to set up sobriety check points at the bridges and tunnels to catch people who came into the city to drink and then drove home. Most of use would take a cab or hire a car service to get home even if it cost us $75 or $100. It was cheaper (and safer) then getting caught or having an accident. I am constantly amazed at the cavalier attitude of people in this area who think nothing of having 3 or more drinks in a short period of time and then driving home.</p>

I don't think it is WI who has the problem, it is the people who get behind the wheel and drive that have the problem and cause more problems. I like to drink, but I know my limit. I think it helps when you go to college and get a lot of that drinking out of your system. And to those parents who don't think their kids drink? HELLO! WAKE UP! Some may, but most are lying right to your face! Parents also do tend to help the &quot;problem&quot; by allowing their kids to drink WITH them. Like the one said, go to a bar......there are kids there! WOW! Hello! Babysitter? People should not cut on Madison, that is a great city, you have to be smart to go to college there and I am sure the kids are stressed! Drinking is a great way to unwind, I did it in college but I got most of that out of my system. I would hope that most people after college get it out of their systems. If not, then they have the problem, not WI</p>

Yes, its not something to be particulary proud about, drunk driving and alcohol related deaths are nothing to be taken lightly. There needs to be better drunk driving laws. I know many people who's lives have been ruined by alcohol. But that is never going to change in this state. We are raised in a place that is obsessed with alcohol. Like many of the people on this list whenever I go some place else or meet people from out of state, they are amazed at our ability to drink. And instead of being ashamed its something I take pride in, yeah its bad but it gives us an identity that makes us unique to our state alone. Many other parts of the country have problems with hard drugs. I'm proud to say that Wisconsin does not have nearly as many problems with meth or cocaine like other regions. Why do we never focus on that aspect? I've been fortunate enough to travel to many differnt states and countries and I've never found a better place than Wisconsin. The people are so geniune and so comfortable with who they are. And drinking plays a part in that. The one thing we all have in common in this state be it different regions, races, or ethnic groups is that we were all born to drink. I grew up in Racine, a city that is more racially mixed and ethnically diverse than any place I've been. The two things that brought the groups together were drinking and sports. If I didn't drink or play sports I would not have any friends of a differnt race, religion, or ethnic group. Yes, alcohol is bad, and it does terrible things, but if you have a problem it don't drink and people here will respect that. If people can handle their alcohol without problems let them drink, thats what makes this country great. We should be proud that we have something that brings us together as a people and embrace it, the good and the bad.</p>

Its human nature to alter the states of consciousness. The problem with drugs and alcohol seems to be more about abuse than use. Making alternatives to alcohol legal and taxing their sales could go towards prevention and rehabilitation from alcohol-related problems. <br />  <br /> If you load one end of the spectrum saying only alcohol is legal, and anything else is bad, of course the alternative for the culture is to continue drinking, often too much. The publics thinking on alcohol, like prescription drugs, if its legal, its gotta be safe, right?? The large corporations often keep this ideal afloat and other alternatives to getting &quot;high&quot; are marginalized, perhaps to the detriment of society.<br />  <br />  If we legalized herb, maybe people will be too stoned to be the dumb, dangerous jerks that give drinking a bad name. <br />  <br />  Also, nobody has ever died from &quot;cannabis poisoning&quot;.

In SE WI alone, how many sports &amp; entertainment venues revolve around alcohol -- (i.e. MILLER Park, Summerfest and all the related fests, just to name a few)?<br />  <br /> I think the only way that WI will ever get serious about changing the culture is when the lawmakers get serious about changing the laws.<br />  <br /> Making a first offense a felony crime in my opinion would be vastly too harsh (this should be reserved only for those instances when no injury/damage has been caused). I do, however, believe that a 2nd offense should be treated as a criminal violation subject not only to fine and imprisonment, but also forfeiture of licnse and vehicle.<br />  <br /> But to give heavier sentencing is not going to be the silver bullet so-to-speak unless we recognize that we need to seriosly address treatment as well. Otherwise, we'll only be giving such offenders the push to incur more violations.<br />  <br /> Having been arrested once for drunk driving (I didn't hurt/damage anyone or anything) was once was enough for me. I consider it to have been a totally ignorant event in my life. To say that my first offense punishment was a slap on the wrist is something that I will vehemently deny; although no one or nothing was hurt/damaged, the fines and various other hurdles I had to jump all that I needed to wake me up. I will carry the scars of that one moment with me for the remainder of my days (and rightly so).<br />  <br /> Consuming alochol, as is driving afterward, is a choice. How we deal with both will only change once we get serious on tackling from all sides in an honest fashion.</p>

In the late 70s, our suicide rate in Richland County was so high professionals started meeting to discuss ways to lower the rate. We did a survey of the county and the results were nothing astounding: high divorce rates, spousal abuse, and heavy drinking/alcoholism were among causative factors. How do you stop people from drinking/driving/hurting themselves/others? The legal approach might address the symptoms of the disease but they do not address the disease of alcoholism itself. Legalizing methods just do not seem to work. Would I be any less arthritic or diabetic after spending five years in prison? It is my firm belief that if we would address the disease not the disastrous outcomes and there would be fewer alcoholics driving on the roads in Wisconsin.</p>

                                                        <p>FIRST OFF, I want to congratulate whoever is the &quot;driving&quot; force behind this exposure. I like to drink as much as anybody, but there IS a problem in Wisconsin.<br /> My reason: My mother was killed in April 1967 on a beautiful Sunday aft. @ 3:30p, by a 21 yr old kid &quot;flying home&quot; from a bar @ 80 mph (police estimate) ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD, and hit my mother's (my car) car head on and killed everyone including himself.<br />  Problem:<br />  The laws are already in place; law enforcement enforces them, but THE JUDGES IN THIS STATE PUT THE   <br />  'R E P E A T E R S' back on the street, and back on the road.<br /> THAT'S WHAT HAS TO BE FIXED. Putting pressure on the judges to enforce the laws we already have. And NOT just on the poor dumb idiots, but the LAWYERS, (like the one the had 7 DUI's and killed a little kid in Mad. back about 4 yrs. ago, after he moved from the Lake Winnebago area w/ the same problem),and politicians themselves, that are NOT enforced.<br />  Fix that, and you won't have to close as many bars as need to be closed.<br />  Thank you.<br />  </p>

The beer and liquor ads gloify everything there is about drinking, and a small disclaimer asking for people to drink responsibility does'nt cut it. I think we should have sobriety checkpoints to help weed out the problem dinkers. A small price in personal freedomn to pay. A price which I am more than willing to do.<br />  <br /> What ever happened to the laws for bartenders, that prohibited them from serving a drunk. There used to be classes set up at Technical Schools to help teach bartenders on how to recognize a person who has too much and hoe to deal with them. The main problem with drinking in Wisconsin is all about money. Money from the brewers and distilleries paid to politicians to bog down the system in regards to drunk driving under the guise of protecting personal liberties.<br />  <br />  The number of repeat offenders in Wisconsin shows a sobering reality as to how big the probem really is.  <br />  <br />  </p>

If I get caught driving I go to jail , if I get caught walking / staggering home from a bar I go to jail , if I get caught sleeping it off in my car I go to jail .<br /> I'm concerned that WI is turning OWI into a big business , there is a lot of money in OWI . I remember a comment made in the news recently by a WI MVD employee concerning pot hole repair on state roads , he commented that the OWI departments have all the money !<br /> Personally I believe that cell phone use while driving is the most dangerous driving act . I witness cell phone drivers every day as I drive to and from work and throughout the day as I have to drive for my job . I've witnessed people drive through red lights totally unaware that they were at an intersection , I've seen drivers using their cell phones and reading newspapers and roadmaps at the same time totally oblivious to their surroundings . Cell phone driving should really carry the same penalties as OWI .<br />  Yes WI has a drinking problem and more .</p>

The real problem is not in Madison, which is reflective of college campuses all around the country, but in the social patterns of adults all around the state. We are teaching kids that it is fun, funny and acceptable for alcohol to serve as a cornerstone in our lives. <br />  <br /> The real question is not if we have a drinking problem but if / how we can change the culture to be less influenced by irresponsible drinking. In my opinion the only hope for this change comes by truly engaging parents in discussions about what they want for their children and what impact they see heavy alcohol consumption, and modeling that behavior, might have on these dreams.<br />  </p>

I have been to other parts of the country, and while they may drink as much as we do, they do not drink to get drunk. People, especially in the Milwaukee are claim that they are against binge drinking, but when it comes down to it, they are the same people getting drunk on the weekend while watching a Packer game. I tired of going to events, and constantly being surrounded by irresponsible drunkards, who think it is OK consume beer in excess, and ruin the good times of others. Until this state wakes up and gets serious about handling it's issues with the bottle, we will continue to see the high numbers of drunken driving deaths we have been so accustomed to.</p>

He only got drunk at home if there was company but often came home drunk from bowling or stopping at a bar after work on Saturday. I was raised in a culture where every occasion included drinking. Luckily I found out I didn't like being hung over more than I enjoyed the social drinking. I believe my son inherited an addictive personality from my side of the family and after going to school at UW Madison became an alcoholic. He lost his job and his marriage to alcohol. I do believe it is a problem.</p>

Born and raised in WI, while I living there I never really gave it much thought--it was just the way it was. I've lived on the East coast for quite some time and shortly after moving here, it became quite apparent that people had a much different attitude towards drinking in general, and particularly in regards to drinking and driving. This is not to say that we do not have our share of drunk driving incidents in our state. But for the most part I think people are much more aware and careful than in other parts of the country.</p>

This is one of the many reasons why I consider Wisconsin one of the worst states to live in in the country. The state government does nothing but look the other way with drunk driving either. I think that the laws need to be tougher for example make the first offense a fine $10,000 or more then start adding work release jail time for the second offense. The third offense should be mandatory 5 years in prison. The fourth offense should be 10 years in prison. No one should ever be stupid enough to get that many drunk driving charges. It's amazing how people dont think drunk driving is a problem but then oppose the idea of a consealed weapons law, driving drunk is just as bad as carrying a loaded gun. For drunk drivers that kill someone as a result of their actions they should be sentenced to life in prison without parole or that is a case where Wisconsin should have the death penalty in place. Anyone who kills another person while drunk driving does not deserve to live and their family should experience the loss that the victims family experiences. This problem will only get worse here in Wisconsin as the years go on. With high taxes and nothing to show for them, drunk driving, increase of crime in the Milwaukee area, no wonder this is becoming one of the worst places in the country.</p>

I was in college 20 years ago and we drank just as much, if not more, than students today do. College kids and 20-somethings in just about all states drink. The difference is that in other places, that behavior is looked at as something you do where you're young and immature. Then you get married, turn 30, have kids, etc. and the binge drinking ends and is replaced by the occasional tailgate or 2 drinks after work. In Wisconsin, you just keep drinking.</p>

If statistics show that Wisconsin leads the way in traffic accidents or deaths as a result of alcohol, I would have to ask if our state's aggressiveness makes for our higher numbers. The tragedy is that all of the studies in the world don't undo the damage caused by those that lack taking any responsibility for their actions under the influence of alcohol. If drinking alcohol, driving a car were treated as privleges that we have rather than a right we would have much less of a problem. I know casually and personally of people in my life that have crossed that line. It outrages me that as a society we continue to tolerate it as much as we do. I would urge anyone that knows of someone in that situation to seek help and not simply look the other way.</p>

In just my city alone, I know one very large extended family who spends all their free time at the bars. I'm not talking a few drinks here and there, these people get drunk and turn nasty on their family members and neighbors. And then when one gets arrested for drunken driving, the family accuses the police of ganging up on them! Ludicrous! This is a culture of drinking, and then they get in their cars and drive home. Nobody is forcing them to do it. Older family members die of kidney failure, cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, and yet they continue to drink like sailors. It's all a game to them, and a disease. My husband and I do not drink often and never to excess, but how can we defend ourselves against this type of behavior? They don't know or aren't willing to admit they are in the wrong apparently. When they kill someone, it will undoubtedly be the other person's fault for being on the road. Alcohol kills. I'm ashamed of my neighbors who drink so much and are so irresponsible to think it won't happen to them. And they're raising the next generation to behave just like them. DARE or COUNTERACT doesn't work, not in this area of the country.</p>

My parents were both pretty heavy drinkers so in comparison, if my wife and I sit on the deck and BBQ and each have 5 or 6 cocktails on a Saturday niether one of us thinks that is a big deal; nor does anyone else we know. No one I know would think of that as binge drinking by any means. Binge drinking to me means 10 or 12, not 5. So is my perception skewed? It would appear yes in comparison to other parts of the country but it is normal here. <br />  <br /> But this is kind of like telling me that if I drive 5 miles an hour over the speed limit I am a dangerous driver.

One thing that I despise, however, is the binge-drinking culture that I see around me. Drunk driving seems to be considered a joke. No one has ever explained to me why a first-time offense (let along a fifth offense!) should not result in the immediate suspension of driving privileges for a really extended period. In my opinion, anyone who drives after drinking too much is just as guilty of pre-meditated murder as the person who actually has the fatal &quot;accident.&quot; They were just luckier, for the time being. There is no such thing as an &quot;accident&quot; while driving drunk. It's all just murder.</p>

This was in Waukesha county, and instead of locking him up and throwing away the keys, they have him pay $4,500.00 and GIVE HIM BACK HIS CAR KEY'S! He now has his occupation liscense, and can drive! (although he has no job). The &quot;Pre-trial&quot; date keeps moving forward, which is now scheduled for the end of october, and his attorney said,&quot;Because you haven't been convicted in over 10 years, they will go easy on you&quot;. <br />  <br /> Little does that Attorney know that I locked up his car key's in a bank safety deposit box, and tried anything to get him off the streets while I was married to him. I also drove him around for the last 9 years. (Although I did not like going to the bars with him, I felt that I would do anything to help prevent him from distroying our lives, and protecting our assets from being taken away from us after working so hard for so many years).<br />  <br /> HE NEEDS HELP, AND WHERE IS IT? Both of our lives as well as our friends and families are destroyed from his drinking. I am so frustrated that an innocent person could get killed. Where are the tough laws? Who is looking out for the innocent by-standers?<br />  <br /> I am the first one to say that the government is taking away our rights little by little, and I don't agree with our freedoms being taken away. I am also a social drinker, and can have only 1-2 drinks and call it a day. But in this instance, I feel the only way a lesson will be learned is to throw the book at him and let him sit in Jail for enough time to detox and give him the help he desperately deserves.<br />  <br />  Lisa A</p>

But I think we need to address this puritan/hedonist complex that we have about alcohol. The drinking age is 21, but most young people under 21 drink. Kids are always lying to their parents about how much they drink so they are often clueless. What we need is balance. Parents need to be the ones that introduce their kids to alcohol, not their peers. Parents need to talk to them about drinking responsibly. If any discussion about underage drinking is off limits, parents will be left in the dark. What we need is a toleration of moderate underage drinking, but cultural condemnation of binge drinking for people of all ages.</p>

The numbers that support this response speak for themselves, and you can view the statistics that suport this in newspapers daily, or on the internet through many different websites.<br />  <br /> The JS is to be congratulated for being bold enough to bring this series to its readers, probably most of whom reside in this state. But the series needs to reach our legislators also; they are the ones that can help to turn this around, with increased penalties for intoxicated-fueled actions whether they involve motor vehicles, boats, ATVs, snowmobiles, bicycles, family fights, homicides, assaults, disorderly conduct--anything that constitutes something that is &quot;...out-of-line...&quot;<br />  <br /> In a court of law, simply describing why someone did something wrong with an explanation that he or she was in an intoxicated state of mind is not acceptable. A person needs to accept personal responsibility, as he or she is the one who made the choice to drink, and then do whatever it was that was out of compliance. And when they do something wrong, they need to &quot;pay their dues, plus a LOT more&quot; when alcohol is involved! <br />  <br />        <br />  <br />  </p>

There seems to be a bar on every corner.People are constantly being served to intoxication and let out on the streets to drive home drunk or become a public nuisance. Wisconsin's laws on OWI and the lax ordinances of how many liquor licenses an area can have contribute to this as well. This is more of the norm then the exception and goes just as equal that it would coming from leaving a a bar or a friends house. In the small town I am from there is over 20 bars/restaraunts within a 5 mile area that we have serving alcohol-more bars then restaraunts. People that are from out of state have commented on how many drinking establishments there are in any given area. People think nothing of having a couple drinks after work to unwind as a coping tool instead of a more useful alternative. I also feel family establishments such as the Zoo and kids party places should not need to serve alcohol. People should be able to have a good time with their family and children without the use of alcohol. Family gatherings always seem to need to have booze as well. If you decide not to serve any, people comment or are hard pressed to even want to come. Very sad that alcohol has to be the center of almost every event that goes on around here.</p>

He right away melted in to the the culture of 24 x 7 socializing and drinking. At the end of his first semester, his GPA was 2.33. By refusing to pay his tuition for drunken semester tow, I pulled him out of school. He is now a student at a small, private college, and is doing very well. <br />  <br /> The problem of &quot;drunkeness&quot; does start at UW, but trickles to other areas all over this state. I was a college partier, too. But I had my first beer at 4 p.m. on Friday. Now, it seems as if the drinking starts on Tuesday, and Monday is the only night left to sober up.</p>

There was far more drinking illegally for my son to experience in Puyallup, Washington during his high school years than my daughter experienced here in Wisconsin. <br />  <br /> You claim this is an unhealthy environment for children to be in the same place where adults are drinking legally? Have you ever been to small rural pub in the UK where the Pub is the center of the neighborhood culture and they don't have nearly the problem we do here in the US. It is the American excess of consumption that is the problem.<br />  <br /> Drinking and driving is a problem, but if we are really concerned with safety on our roads, lets treat those who drive while using a cellphone or are text messaging who cause accidents with the same laws we treat those who drive while intoxicated. That is equally a large problem in the Seattle Tacoma area and probably causes as many accidents.</p>

A lot of other college campuses have issues of excessive abuse of designer drugs. Wisconsin kids don't have the income for that. <br />  <br /> The issue appears more prevalent because we do a better job of not pushing it under the rug and nor are we willing to accept the prevalent &quot;boys will be boys&quot; attitudes accepted so readily in other locations. The culture of drinking&quot; to have a good time&quot; is all-American, don't kid yourself. Binge drinking implies that one stops and starts, many places I have lived in there are those in a community who never stop drinking. Do we have problem, sure but more than other places? I think we just happen to be more honest.</p>

People go out or to a party with the explicit intention of getting drunk. It's like the whole state is consumed with making itself feel good by forgetting and being irresponsible. This goes for parents and grandparents as well as young people. It's a family value here, quite different from other parts of the country!</p>

I just moved from the state of Vermont and I knew that the people there also experienced drinking problems, but upon my first couple of months in the state of Wisconsin, I was informed that Wisconsin is a huge drinking state and that everyone in Wisconsin is a huge drinker. I visited several of the festivals this summer in Milwaukee and other cities and found that alcohol is the main-stay of each of these festivals. I was quite shocked and also it has put a sour taste in my mouth that what the festivals are intended for is partying. I thought they were to celebrate the different ethnic groups and diversity within the area. How sad that everywhere you go, people are drunk and planning on becoming drunk, during these festivals and summer events. I have not lived here during the winter months, but knowing that people will be stuck inside more than other seasons, I can only imagine that drinking will be a top priority by many. Children are growing up seeing their parents and adults in their lives drink and quite heavily, so they don't know better and are even included from a young age in the party scene. What a shame, since life has so much more to offer than drinking and partying. I see a beautiful state with outdoor activities, colleges and schools for a great education, cultural and social events (without drinking) to interact with others, and many church and community events (without drinking) that many people could get involved with, not mention that Wisconsin is the number 8th state for poverty in the U.S.A. with many children going hungry right here in Milwaukee. Get involved in other people and helping others, get involved in your community or church, look for ways to help others and I can guarantee that you will feel a high that you never would with drinking, plus the next day, you will experience that same high feeling remembering that someone out there benefited from your help and generosity versus a hang over from the day before drinking binge and the inability to even help yourself, let alone another person.</p>

                                                        <p>I am an alcoholic and attended a University of Wisconsin school for four straight years following high school graduation but had to leave school due to my drinking habits. I am not faulting anyone but myself for being an alcoholic, but my drinking career began when I was 20 years old and lived on a UW campus. It too me five years to become a hard core alcoholic. Now I am 26 and back in school. There really is no good answer for this. My public school system had about two different drug education programs in the elementary level, &quot;Just Say No.&quot; and &quot;Dare.&quot; Both programs were dropped as far as I know. But both programs really did not touch on any of the &quot;legal drugs&quot; such as alcohol and smoking. There also is not easy answer on solving the &quot;at-home&quot; solutions either, parents of children will continue drinking at social gatherings no matter what. But schools prior to college need to take this more seriously than the way they handled substance abuse as whole when I was in grade and high school. I don't blame anyone for me being an alcoholic at this point, but no certain class is more immune than another. A person can be rich with money and be an alcoholic while a person who lives below poverty lines may not be an alcoholic. All different races, ages and economic classes are effected by alcoholism. It may be a bit unfair to blame a certain group of people for this.</p>

Even as a young person in the '50's and '60's there was the extreme pressure to drink and if you didn't, you were looked down upon. We still own property in N.

It is something that WI has to come to grips with because it really makes the state look bad around the country.</p>

                                                        <p>(1) I believe that alcohol abuse is a problem for those who abuse it.<br /> (2) As an Appleton native, I'm not surprised at the statistic that there are more bars than some larger cities, but this can be misleading. Tennessee, for example, has a larger population of people who are abstemious because of their religious beliefs than does Wisconsin. Other states may have different licensing requirements for stand-alone taverns. Still, the Fox Valley has its share and then some.<br /> (3) As a UW alumnus (1970), I'm dismayed at the reputation the University has garnered for alcohol abuse. When I was a student there, we drank (for sure) and we were on Playboy's party school list (but not #1), but I never saw a mounted police officer on State Street. For the parents of prospective students, this reputation risks obscuring the excellent reputation the University of Wisconsin has for academics.<br /> (4) Not everyone who gets &quot;toasted&quot; becomes jolly and gregarious. In my forays to bars (when younger), about half the drunken people I encountered were loud, rude, and in-your-face. Even at Packer games, what starts out as good-natured banter turns into &quot;(your team's name here)sucks!&quot; by halftime and then it's off to the races.<br />  (5) Not to mention all these people drive.<br />  <br />  I had a misspent youth like everyone else. Some of us got past it. Some of us didn't.</p>

Today the requirements are very high. You need to be almost a 4.0 (on a 4.0 scale) and a very high ACT/Sat score. Madison is attracting the best of the best. My daughter recently graduated from Madison, received a top notch education, had some fun along the way and is a wonderful young woman we are very proud of.

                                                        <p>Sadly, I have to admit that Wisconsin has a drinking problem. I live in Milwaukee, and do attend the bars. As a single person I do go to the bars as part of my social life. I plan to write about this situation in another local paper. <br /> I am from Chicago, and have been living here 22 years. I have a career here in the Arts. But, I can't help but feel that I have never fit in. This has to do with the strong alcohol and sports activities that put us on the map. <br /> While I try to fit in and enjoy all of the wonderful opportunities in this city; the Arts and Education certainly take a major 2nd to drinking and sports. This is a sports town. The Rep and many local theaters are known for outstanding work. Yet, try to mention that in N.Y.C. or L.A. They know our town for our Beer. Yes, Beer or the FONZIE put us on the map.<br />     Beer gave many people a living, and they grew up with it....but the beer industry is all but gone in Milwaukee today.  <br /> How sad that we will never got over that image...no-matter how we work at it. Our drinking image has now made all of this worse. <br /> I see so many people drink to excess in the bars. I see them kicked out for the excess. Some take a taxi, but many get in their cars and drive. There is anger in the bars, protest, and loud shouting. <br /> I try to be a social drinker..one or two. But, someone will always buy my another etc. Then drinking causes depression, anxiety, high blood pressure and liver problems. Many medical problems. The slight benefits for the heart are minor when one compares the negative problems. <br /> One glass of regular grape juice can also give one the same benefits. I try to stop drinking even one, but being in a Milwaukee bar with all the many drinkers...makes one want to just fit in. I have seen many who look older, or heavy because of drinking, and many have lost their jobs and families. I personally lost my Mother at 55 to alcohol which in turn caused her depression. <br /> I plan to control my social habits, and look at the positive side of Milwaukee. I personally feel many are drinking to excess to escape to awful economy and World situations. I see our town as a place to be proud of. I would love to see us change our status as No.1 for drinking!

No alcohol, no cigarettes, no sex, no internet, no cable TV, no sports, no swimming, no sky diving, no motorcycles, no bicycles. We know better than all the stupid people who enjoy these activities! Our world would be so much more safe if everyone just worked, slept and then grew old and died.<br />  <br /> On the other hand, maybe we should let 18 year old legal adults make their own choices, be held accountable for their actions and the rest of us keep our noses out of their lives.</p>

They learn by watching, and unfortunately, too many parents give their kids a very poor example, by having beer or liquor at every single social event there is, thinking that's the key to a great party. Or they think it's cute to take a picture of a toddler playing with an empty beer can or bottle. Or we worship a baseball team called the Brewers, who play at a stadium called Miller Park, where everything is sponsored by beer, and where team logos feature products used in beer-making. And our towns have a bar on every corner. But it starts with parents and grandparents, who glorify drinking with their own behavior, by thinking it's okay to let their children drink, so long as they do it at home. As we say here, &quot;Those who host lose the most.&quot;</p>

Even though alot of these people are not 21 they have been drinking for a few years already. I think the drinking problem will never be brought under control. The state profits off of drunk drivers, why would they want to get it under control. We owned that bar for three years. I couldn't do it any more. I didn't want to be the one at fault for someones death. Thank god none of our customers lost their lives due to drinking and driving. We had a rule in our bar, if you drank to much you spent the night. If they slept on the pool table so be it. the pool table got alot of use other than what it should be used for. Our bar was in a small community called Dotyville, which is in Fond Du Lac county. Most of our customers lived with in a mile or so from the bar but still bad things can happen within that mile or so. I'm glad to be a non bar owner. Trying to control fifty drunk people became to much stress for me.I've seen people go from sober to wasted in twenty minutes time. I've seen people so drunk that they'd take clothes off and not realize they were naked. Drinking takes away your morals. Why is it legal in the first place?</p>

As a child I remember laying in my bed at night trembling while my father would be on his drunken rampage. Lucky for me all the alcohol drinking I witnessed traumatized me enough to make me never want to drink and be like the so called roll models I grew up seeing.<br /> Now trying to date a man who doesn't drink is next to impossible. I just broke up with a guy because on our first two dates he got drunk to the point it was disgusting and a big turn off! I will never understand why someone needs alcohol to help them feel good.

Harley festivals/rides are never without alcohol. We cook our food with beer. Even church functions/fairs/festivals here serve alcohol. I stay close to home on the big holidays (New Years, St Patty's, July 4th, Memorial Day, Labor Day) just to stay safe. The culture is sick and getting sicker...</p>

                                                        <p>Booze was a big part of my life for longer than I care to admit. My friends drank so I drank right along with them -- and I kept on drinking long after my friends weren't around. My parents drank. It wasn't very often when I wasn't exposed to booze in one way or another, it was always around me. <br />  <br /> I got married and I got divorced. I kept drinking. Then it dawned on me, I have a son who could grow up just like me, and that scared the hell out of me. When he was two years old, I quit for good, because I realized the odds of him drinking would be dramatically increased if he were exposed to a drinking environment (me) at a young age. My son didn't grow up just like me and he's currently a sophomore at UWM. He's involved in healthy activities such as soccer, running, and weight-lifting.<br />  <br /> We as parents are the first and most important step in keeping our children from becoming a part of Wisconsin's culture of drinking. It all begins at home. As parents we have a choice of what kind of example we set for our children while they're growing up. The choice we make will have a profound affect on them for the rest of their lives.</p>

I don't think there's anything wrong with that, however, one of the main reasons I left Wisconsin (other than the winter) is that there's nothing to do besides drink in Wisconsin. I love sports, I love beer, I love to have a good time, but I also love other things that aren't available in Wisconsin. Culture is limited, as is entertainment. There's also a lot of ignorance. So what do you do to pass the time in the dead of winter? Drink. What do you do to celebrate when summer finally rolls around? Drink.<br />  Take a look at the culture and the other options for people to pass the time. It is what it is and it isn't going to change.</p>

You can find a better education system outside this state, and one that isn't such a party school. I would never send my kids to Madison, no matter what everyone else thinks of it. I'd rather send them to a private college within the Milwaukee area than to Madison.<br />  <br /> And any parent that thinks &quot;My son/daughter doesn't drink&quot; while they're at Madison are just fooling themselves. Wake up. Everyone I knew that went to Madison always told their parents &quot;Oh gosh, I don't drink, it's so hard to find friends here&quot; and on the weekends they would be at the bars drinking with the rest of them. It's easy to lie to your parents over the phone. Your kid's probably shaking off a hang over right now. And if not, it's only a matter of time before they give into the lifestyle.</p>

In the State of Washington, a restaurant, bar, or lounge exhibiting that same conduct would be liable to liquor license revocation. In fact, were a liquor license inspector to come upon such a scene in the State of Washington that bar/restaurant would be closed immediately! Doors padlocked. End of Discussion!<br />  <br /> Why does a state that clings so tenaciously to family values -- such as Wisconsin -- promote such an unstable and unhealthy environment for the family? I must ask further, why does a state with any kind of value for life so destructively promote an environment of irresponsible consumption of adult beverages from womb to tomb?<br />  <br /> You would be incorrect to assume that these comments come from a right wing extremist. Life long Democrat here. I just don't think we are promoting a very healthy environment for families -- gay, straight or otherwise -- when we tolerate a drinking environment which is so very lax.</p>

Here in Oregon, drinking is not a part of the culture at all. I was used to having a bar on every corner and I can count the bars here all on one hand. Sure, people do drink, but it's more about quality rather than quantity. You have a lot of microbreweries and home brewers, but you just don't see as much binge drinking. For instance, there is no alcohol at Oregon State football games. I was shocked at first, but I'm starting to realize that the norms I grew up with aren't necessarily healthy. I think it's great that the JS is tackling this subject.</p>

I learned my lession when I got pulled over for D.U.I years ago, and my stupidity I refused to take the breathalizer test, but still I didn't go unpunished and haven't drank since then. But yes we do have problems.</p>

In Brown deer I have had the pleasure of seeing folks of all ages fall flat on their face drunk in their yards.<br />  <br /> In Europe . I lived there for 26 years , I saw the same variation. It's called culture and morality. Those who are perpetually drunk , are without morals , without direction and without soul.<br />  <br />  Little can be done since the media driven culture demands that the average citizen be a drunk. Drunks are easily manipulated.<br />  <br /> Wisconsin seems to try to outdo the world in it's juvenile , &quot;I don't care ,&quot; attitude. I suspect that this is a cultural problem. Germany , Poland , Russia , England and Scotland have the same problem.<br />  <br />  </p>

There were about 160 other counselors from 40 different states, and we had all gone out for a night of bowling. Maybe a quarter of us were of legal drinking age, and since I wasn't driving, I was having a few beers. Someone said out loud &quot;Jane, you've had 4 beers. That would put me under the table.&quot; Someone else said out loud &quot;dude, she's from Wisconsin. All the people here from Wisconsin can drink.&quot; I found out later that summer that the only people that could outdrink the Wisconsin people was the exchange student - from Russia. So yeah, I think Wisconsin has a reputation for drinking.</p>

                                                        <p>Being born and raised in Wisconsin positioned me quite substantially in becoming an alcoholic--that seems quite plain to me. Wisconsin is, as the lead story says, the state with the highest amount of binge-drinkers in the country. It also is the state with the fewest sober people. That's quite a perfect storm for trouble. Of course, these statistics may end up being partial excuses for one's own personal decisions, but the drinking environment, the atmosphere, in Wisconsin is a thing onto itself. I've lived in New York and California now, and these states are extremely mild in drinking atmospheres by comparison. In Wisconsin, it's always right around the corner. The topic is seemingly always in the air. When I was a drinker, I never noticed it; but now I see and hear it all the time.<br />  <br /> My own iniation into the ritual of drinking began certainly and basically with being in the room of drinkers, of my family and relatives, all of whom drank to greater and lesser degrees. (The only relative who didn't drink was a recovering alcoholic). This normalized the experience. Further on, I would be given the task of fetching beers for relatives and neighbors, and therefore positioning myself as alcohol delivery person. It moved from a part of the environment to being directly in my hands. I would give these bottles to people I knew and who were friendly to me. It thus seemed to be no problem. Alcohol must be friendly as well, logic implies, if friends and neighbors liked it.<br />  <br /> I was also distinctly raised in a German-American household. (We're also a little British and French, but the community was 95% German). Germans like to drink; it's a certain part of the culture. This culture was transported to America, to the heartland, where I grew up. I had my first sip of beer when I was quite young, probably around six or seven. I didn't drink a full beer, though, I don't think, until I was probably 10 or 11 years old. I remember getting drunk with a friend in his father's homemade wine cellar on the 4th of July, my birthday. We emerged from it, stumbling, grabbed the sparklers from our parents, and went running around on the sloping backyard hill. I remember falling down continually, and also the stray light effect of the sparklers.<br />  <br /> High school was just a four-year drinking party, full of constant drinking and driving, blackouts, pillow vomit, headaches, parties, sullenness, sexual frustration, depression, addiction to allergy medicines (I liked feeling spaced out), virulent sarcasm, and general distancing from people. It was no surprise then when I was ticketed by the police for drinking on school property during halftime of a girl's volleyball game (another excuse to drink). The news quickly ran up to the school section, and then I had to inform my folks. All of this landed me in an eight-week course for problem drinking. I just laughed it off, unlistening to all the sobering news and statistics. The teachers who led the course must not have been amused--I'm sure they weren't being paid much to run the courses.<br />  <br /> What followed was really just more of the same, only more alcohol was needed. I didn't realize, for instance, that I was actually having blackouts, though, until I quit drinking. It just seemed quite normal to not remember anything but compressed seconds--perhaps non-consecutive seconds--from the night before. I ended up with a frayed head eventually, which seems, of course, &quot;normal,&quot; because the alcoholic isn't ready to say to him/herself that he/she isn't well. So, frayed head, full of disjunction, full of paranoia, full of suspicion, full of shit, with cowardly sarcasm in tow. Hi, how are you?<br />  <br /> Attending graduate program just continued the same behavior, with the added benefit of being around some people just like me. It was like heaven, at least for awhile. But my alcoholism was really growing by leaps and bounds during this period, which came to involve drinking and getting drunk nightly, a pack and a </p>

                                                        <p>I've lived in other states and, having moved back here 8 years ago, I'm still struck be the stark differences in this state's attitude toward drinking as compared to other states. I think it comes down to one fundamental difference. In Wisconsin, drinking most frequently isn't something that you do as a social aside while you're doing something else; most often, drinking is the activity itself. So, rather than going to a baseball game and having a couple of beers while you're there, you go to a tailgate party to get bombed and maybe watch a baseball game while you're at it. Certainly this happens elsewhere, but not nearly with such frequency nor is it the expectation. <br />  <br /> A few weeks ago, I was on an elevator with two young women - mid-20's, maybe - that were discussing going to that night's Brewer game. The topic of their conversation wasn't who they'd see there, who the Brewers were playing or even if they'd drink or not. Rather, there were discussing the degree to which they thought they could get drunk. They both had plans the next day that they figured would be hampered by a more severe hangover. Maybe having young kids and my college years a decade behind me has changed my perspective, but I was pretty baffled. And I thought... That's it, right there - the difference between Wisconsin and most other states. We don't happen have a few beers while we're doing something else. We get drunk while we happen to be doing something else. It's pretty pathetic, really....</p>

But as pointed out, it's the driving after part that is the major problem. In bigger cities you could say this is easily solved by calling a cab or taking the bus. But in those smaller towns where nothing else is going on, people get sloshed @ the bar and drive home. How to stop that is beyond me. Side note: ND is #2 in binge drinking? Iowa &amp; Ill are #3? Too funny.</p>

The UW culture is an overriding one of binge drinking. She is told that there are indeed other students who don't drink - but that it is hard to meet such like minded peers. The university does absolutely nothing during the freshman experience to help these kids find each other. As a parent, I am incredibly disappointed with UW - Madison. <br />  <br /> The university should realize that there are great kids who will follow the law but also want to have a rewarding social experience. What is the institution doing to cultivate these students who may help turn this disturbing culture around?</p>
