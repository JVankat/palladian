		<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">SAN FRANCISCO, 
		California, September 5, 2005<b>&nbsp; </b>&#8212; General Electric, Inc. is to 
		realize a 406% return on investment by moving to SWIFTNet for use by its 
		Corporate Treasury in Cash and Treasury Management, according to an 
		audit by Thoughtware Worldwide, LLC, an independent research and 
		consulting firm specializing in value measurement.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%">
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one of the most 
	recognized and respected brands in the world, GE Corporate Treasury manages 
	billions of dollars every day, serving over 4,000 business units, spanning 
	20,000 bank accounts with over 200 banks around the globe.&nbsp; For GE Corporate 
	Treasury, availability, reliability, security and control are paramount to 
	getting the job done &#8211; collecting money from customers and paying vendors in 
	over a dozen foreign currencies.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%">
	<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">GE, like most 
	multi-nationals, was wrestling with multiple banking relationships and 
	connections to execute their cash management (payment and receipts) 
	strategies. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;Scaling 
	to handle the volume and demands of its growing business, GE would have 
	required an increase in headcount to process more than the current 50% level 
	of treasury volume.&nbsp; IT (Information</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%">
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">Technology) was spending a 
	significant amount of resources to maintain multiple systems, connection 
	points and security protocols.&nbsp; Each connection was different &#8211; systems, 
	processes, and data (quality, availability and timeliness) impacting GE&#8217;s 
	ability to quickly assemble a view of its current cash positions.&nbsp; IT was in 
	an endless cycle of break-fix, work-a-rounds, and update and maintaining of 
	the various connections and security protocols.&nbsp; To overcome these 
	challenges, GE made the decision to use SWIFT, and its SWIFTNet 
	Corporate-to-Bank (C2B) solution to provide GE with a simple, secure and 
	reliable communications platform to transmit financial messages to and from 
	GE&#8217;s banks around the globe.&nbsp; &#8220;With SWIFTNet, we never have to worry about 
	availability,&#8221; said Dennis Sweeney, Assistant Treasurer, GE.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%">
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">Using SWIFTNet, GE is able 
	to create one window from its internal Treasury Workstation, (GE WebCash) 
	directly to its banks via Closed User Groups (CUGs).&nbsp; The SwiftNet solution 
	allows GE to replace its existing fragmented approach, comprised of 
	point-to-point, EDI VANS (Value Added Networks) and proprietary bank 
	connections to one single, reliable, integrated non-repudiated platform.&nbsp; 
	Best summarized by Steve Kalkowski, Manager of GE Cash Management Systems, 
	&#8220;We have unlocked the constraints of our infrastructure by moving to 
	SWIFTNet.&#8221;&nbsp; Since the implementation began, GE Treasury has realized 
	enormous benefits from the combination of SWIFTNet and GE WebCash.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%">
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">A recent study conducted by 
	Thoughtware Worldwide, LLC, an independent research and consulting firm 
	specializing in value measurement, projects GE&#8217;s investment at an impressive 
	406% Return On Investment (ROI) resulting in significant economic, 
	strategic, and operational benefits.&nbsp; </span><b>
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><b>
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">Greater Reliability</span></b><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%"><br>
	Before SWIFTNet, GE Corporate Treasury was spending a significant amount of 
	money and resources addressing the complexity of interfacing with over 30 
	primary banks, 200+ banks in all, incorporating over 20,000 bank accounts.&nbsp; 
	This enormous effort required more than six full-time equivalents fully 
	dedicated to mapping software for financial messaging, monitoring, and 
	managing connection points to multiple systems and banks around the globe.&nbsp; 
	&#8220;Before SWIFTNet, it took 10% of a person&#8217;s time to chase failed 
	transactions,&#8221; according to Charlotte Powell, Managing Director, Global Cash 
	Operations. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><b>
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">Improved Security</span></b><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%"><br>
	In today&#8217;s on-line, digital world, security is top of mind for everyone &#8212; 
	especially so for one of the most respected brands in the world.&nbsp; The GE 
	brand symbolizes strength, security and reliability mandating that it 
	operate in the most secure environment available.&nbsp; Before SWIFTNet, GE 
	juggled multiple security packages, protocols and security keys &#8212; a never 
	ending management headache for GE Corporate Treasury&#8217;s operations.&nbsp; With 
	multiple banks, GE was constantly in an update, upgrade, and test mode, with 
	no end in sight for the underlying costs.&nbsp; </span><b>
	<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><b>
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">Increased Visibility</span></b><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%"><br>
	&nbsp;With its previous infrastructure, GE was burdened by mapping its 
	transactions to the format dictated by each bank, severely hindering its 
	ability to quickly scale and on-board additional financial institutions.&nbsp; 
	Also, without real-time responses to outbound messaging, control of 20,000+ 
	bank accounts was nearly impossible.&nbsp; The majority of banks update 
	transaction status through batch processing on an end-of-day or next day 
	basis, further challenging GE&#8217;s visibility into intraday balances, and truly 
	impacting its ability to perform true cash management.&nbsp; </span><b>
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%"><b>
	<span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%">Quantifiable Benefits</span></b><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 150%"><br>
	Thoughtware Worldwide&#8217;s analysis shows GE Corporate Treasury will generate 
	$10.5 million in Net Benefits over five years from its investment in 
	SWIFTNet.&nbsp; From the operational benefits alone, GE achieves a positive 
	return on its investment in SWIFTNet.&nbsp; &#8220;For us, the key finding is that 
	SWIFTNet enables GE to redeploy its resources to more value-add activities, 
	allowing GE to focus on running its business more efficiently.&nbsp; With 
	SWIFTNet, GE no longer has to worry about connectivity, reliability or 
	transaction monitoring,&#8221; said Timothy Guyre, Managing Director, Thoughtware 
	Worldwide, LLC.&nbsp; Beyond the operational benefits GE Corporate Treasury 
	received from SWIFTNet, GE will achieve long term benefits from its improved 
	visibility and availability of cash around the globe, resulting in improved 
	cash management and reduced borrowing through optimization of its idle 
	cash.&nbsp;</span></p>
