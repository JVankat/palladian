I&#8217;ve heard/read that most of Panama and Nicaragua are infested with guerrillas. I&#8217;m up for adventure (I want to circumnavigate most of South America) but I don&#8217;t want to die!! Can it be done safely? I&#8217;m looking for the cheapest way to South America&#8230;and flying ain&#8217;t cheap.</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by ?</i><br/>I live in Panama and I would not recommend venturing into the Darrien for more than one reason. If you do want to pass through there, you really need to have an experienced guide. There are very posionous snakes that it is home to. During the rainy season, which is now, the roads are almost non existant. That&#8217;s just the start of my telling you not to try it by land. The added major problem is of course, the guerillas. Please be advised to go by air. </p>

<p>The Carnival of <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a>, properly spelled &#8220;Carnaval&#8221; in Portuguese, is an annual festival in <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a> held forty days before Easter. On certain days of Lent, Roman Catholics and some other Christians traditionally abstained from the consumption of meat and poultry, hence the term &#8220;carnival,&#8221; from carnelevare, &#8220;to remove (literally, &#8220;raise&#8221;) meat.&#8221;Carnival celebrations are believed to have roots in the pagan festival of Saturnalia, which, adapted to Christianity, became a farewell to bad things in a season of religious discipline to practice repentance and prepare for Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection. Rhythm, participation, and costumes vary from one region of <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a> to another. In the southeastern cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, organized parades led by samba schools are influenced in aesthetics by Venice Carnival. Those official parades are meant to be watched by the public, while minor parades (&#8220;blocos&#8221;) allowing public participation can be found in other cities. The northeastern cities of Salvador, Porto Seguro and Recife have organized groups parading through streets, and public interacts directly with them. This carnival is heavily influenced by African-Brazilian culture. Crowds follow the trio elétricos floats through the city streets. Also in northeast, Olinda carnival features unique characteristics, part influenced by Venice Carnival mixed with cultural despections of local folklore. Carnival is the most famous <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> in <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a> and has become an event of <b>&#8230;</b><br />

<p>My other mate – wants to go to New York because she crazy about USA </p>
<p>And my other mate wants to go to India Goa and Mumbai because she heard lots of good stuff there to see and do, </p>
<p>well anyway if we do go to <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">brazil</a> or Peru, I would like to see the Amazon river, now I can’t swim and I’m not in love with crocodiles and snakes but I want to experience something out of my comfort zone, </p>
<p>So I was wondering are the Amazon River tours dangerous e.g. are they safe tours with good reliable boats and safety etc&#8230; I have read the information on the website but im not sure, because the Amazon is a bit scary</p>
<p>Any advice&#8230;..?     </p>

    </h3>
      
        
          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by runningtostandstill</i>: Can Ireland seriously survive a recession.?</strong><br />
Most people remember that there was NO prosperity in Ireland save for a few corupt people prior to the 90s. </p>
<p>With the Celtic Tiger many people were trained and got jobs because companies had to do that to get staff. It was boom boom boom, lots of jobs, houses went up, prices rocketed. People bought <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> homes abroad etc etc. </p>
<p>No prior to this Ireland was a third world country with massive unemployment, for example in 1988 you could get a 4 bed house in dundrum on dublins south side for around 50k, 20 year later they are close to 800k. </p>
<p>So with <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> companies cutting back and looking for what ireland once was (a cheap, english speaking workforce with good subsidies) in other locations what will happen to Ireland. </p>
<p>You can not say that we survived this before because we didnt, Ireland would never have had the celtic tiger without Europe (who are pissed at the Irish over the lisbon treaty) and America (who are in their own mess) so its unlikely that there will be another celtic tiger. </p>
<p>What do you seriously think, I dont think it will be 2010, I think it could not come back, if other <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> companies like Intel, Ebay and the biopharmas move that will be it.<br />
Thats the thing, the only reason that people bought houses and the only reason that people had new cars was the abundance of US jobs and the ancillary industries to support them. </p>
<p>Unlike the UK, Ireland doesnt have any industries. Its a terrible situation.</p>

<p><i>Answer by carmen</i><br/>if u do go to <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">brazil</a> just b very very careful, especially with ur children! my father used to travel there a lot n i have heard some bad stories about the crime and corruption. a girl i knew who went there as an exchange student from the usa was kidnapped out of her host family&#8217;s home and held for ransom, which i hear happens quite a lot. everything turned out ok, and she was able to come home unharmed. dont get me wrong though, ive known all of my father&#8217;s brazilian friends, and they are very loving and fun people that really know how to party! in the trips my dad took there he said  was there he said the pickpocketing was really bad, so id say look into getting something that u wear under ur clothes that holds ur money and looks like u dont have it on. i also hear there is a lot of carjacking, so always lock ur doors if u rent a car. dont carry all of ur money on u at once. do what u can to not look like a tourist. stay aware of ur surroundings and learn portuguese as well as u can so u are able to understand what is being said around u. good luck!</p>

Here&#8217;s what I have so far: (this is just what I wrote not including decor and pics)<br />
TITLE SLIDE<br />
Slide 2: GUINEA PIG BACKGROUND<br />
Guinea pigs originate from South America. Even though they are not actual pigs, males are called “boars” ,and females “sows”. Females can weigh up to 1lb., males up to 2lbs. The three most common pet breeds of guinea pigs are: The Smooth-Coated, with short, glossy fur, the Abyssinian, with hair that grows in fluffy tufts all over the body, and the Peruvian, with long, silky hair to the ground. Guinea Pigs, otherwise known as “Cavies”, must be kept in pairs because they are social herd animals in the wild and can actually get depressed without someone else to “talk” to. “Guinea pigs make wonderful companions. These docile members of the rodent family rarely bite and are known for squeaking with delight when their favorite humans enter the room. Guinea pigs are excellent starter pets for older children who have mastered proper handling techniques.”- http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/small-pet-care/guinea-pig-care.html<br />
Slide 3: WHY I WANT GUINEA PIGS<br />
Well, there are a few reasons why I want Guinea Pigs, here they are:<br />
1. I’m not going to lie, one reason I want them is that they are extremely cute!<br />
2. Another reason I want them is that recently both of my pets that were just mine passed away. I loved them very much and was very sad and although I know you cannot replace animals, I want new ones to love in their place!<br />
3. I also want them because out of all the possible pets I researched (puppy, kitten, etc.) I feel like I am the most ready (maturely and responsibly) for Guinea Pigs.<br />
4. I am ready to take on this new responsibility because I am determined to do it and it will teach me good life lessons for the future.<br />
5. Once I go to college I won’t be able to have my own pets for a long time, so I want to have the things I love the most while I still can.<br />
Slide 4: COST<br />
I know about, and am not avoiding the issue of cost. I have already contemplated it. Guinea Pigs can sometimes be pricey since they need veggies everyday, and toys and bedding and whatnot. Which is why, if I get Guinea Pigs, I am giving up all <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> presents from you for a whole year, and bringing it down to one good present for every <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> for the future years with my Guinea Pigs. That should cover everything considering I can use the <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> money I get from other people for some of the costs too. If this does not work for you we can negotiate it.<br />
Slide 5:FUN FACTS<br />
* Guinea Pigs’ teeth grow constantly so they need to continually wear them down by chewing on wooden chew sticks.<br />
* Guinea Pigs are the smartest of all rodents. They can be trained to do almost all of the same tricks as dogs.<br />
* A very happy and/or excited Guinea Pig will begin to “hop” up and down. This is called “Popcorning” in young ones.<br />
* Guinea pigs cannot produce their own vitamin C, just like us humans, so they need vitamin C tablets and/or one cup of fruits and veggies per day.<br />
Slide 6: OTHER NEEDS<br />
Three other needs of Guinea Pigs are brushing, bathing, and clipping. And by that I mean brushing their fur, bathing them, and clipping their nails. This does not have to be done that often however, and depends on the individual needs of your Guinea Pig.<br />
Slide 7: WORKING OUT THE KINKS<br />
I know there are some other issues. First of all, is when I go to my dad’s house. I have thought up some options. First of all, I could leave them here and Mom could take care of them (feed them two cups veggies, pet them), but I don’t think you guys would like that. Or, if I get enough money (which I don’t have enough, but like I said about the present deal), I could buy another cage, but just a cheap small-ish one to keep at my dad’s and use the carrier (in my supplies list) to transport them to my dads with me. (I like the second plan better.) Another issue is <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/vacation/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with vacation">vacation</a>, but since I would be getting two guinea pigs they would be fine (with the social interaction issue), but Jay would have to feed them veggies, and pet them, and stuff.<br />
Slide 8-11:SUPPLIES<br />
(a bunch of pics of the supplies they need)<br />
Slide 12: ALL IN ALL</p>
<p>I really hope this slide show has changed your mind for the better, at least a little. I really hope you understand that I will be dedicated to these little guys (or should I say girls?). Just please, trust me and give me a chance. If you (my mom) has to take care of them a lot (besides when I’m with my dad, depending on the deal we work out) then you guys can give them away. But I swear that won’t happen, just please, please trust me and give me a chance to prove that I’ve changed and I really am responsible. I will love them with all of my heart.</p>
<p>So, do you think there is anything I need to add or take out? Please, this is very important, I really need to convince him.<br />
YOU DONT HAVE TO READ ALL OF THIS IF YOU DONT FEEL LIKE IT, JUST GO TO THE BOTTOM</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by B</i><br/>Very persuasive I might need this to help convince my dad! </p>
<p>Actually I have figured out for bedding and pellets and hay it&#8217;s .</p>
<p>The guinea pig where I live is . </p>
<p>The cage (if you make one it&#8217;s so much cheaper they are called C&#038;C cages) is around . </p>
<p>It averages out to be around 0 dollars for one guinea pig (or if you get too a little extra). </p>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by Jason</i>: Cheap open ended ticket to South America from California (SFO)?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m planning on embarking on an extended travel/work adventure to South America with my significant other. We were planning on leaving California on New years eve (cheap one way tix) for Buenos Aires. However, I&#8217;ve heard waiting to buy a return ticket when you&#8217;re ready to come home can be quite pricey. Any advice on how to go about buying plane tickets if we:</p>
<p>a. dont know when we are coming home?<br />
b. dont know where we are going to be flying home from?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by nako</i><br/>Since you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re planning on returning from, the only option that you really have is to buy your one-way ticket to Buenos Aires now, and then buy your one-way ticket back to San Francisco at the point where and when you know you want to return.  As you already noted, this option is quite expensive &#8212; a last-minute one-way ticket could be several times more expensive than if you had planned in advance.  Thus, you&#8217;re probably better off figuring out at least where you plan on flying back from.</p>
<p>If you can at least figure out where you&#8217;re flying back from, you can at least plan to purchase a round-trip ticket at that point.  If you figure out that departure city, you have two options:</p>
<p>1)  Buy an open ticket, where the date is left open for your return.  This is probably one of the most expensive options you have, as it&#8217;s essentially an unrestricted full-fare ticket &#8212; this type of ticket may be as expensive as simply buying two one-way tickets.</p>
<p>2) Buy a non-refundable ticket that allows date changes.  If you buy a round-trip ticket with a certain return date, but you end up having to change that date, a ticket with the flexibility of changing the return date will allow you to do so upon payment of the change fee and any fare difference.  Usually, though, if you are changing the return date after you&#8217;ve flowin the outbound leg, there is no fare difference if there is availability at your specific fare for the dates you want to travel.</p>
<p>The change fee is likely to be as much as several hundred dollars, but that several hundred dollars is far, far likely to be cheaper than buying unrestricted tickets or two one-way tickets.  If you do this, though, you&#8217;re going to have to choose your return city in advance, and you&#8217;ll probably want to make your return date a little later than you actually plan on coming back.  (If you make the return date sooner than you want to come back and forget to change the date, then your reservation automatically cancels as soon as you fail to show up for the return flight.  Making the return date later is a form of insurance against forgetting to make the change.)</p>

<p>San Pedro de Atacama is located at the foothills of Chile&#8217;s Andean Cordillera, in the heart of the driest desert in the world. At 2450 meters above sea level, it&#8217;s hard to catch your breath in part due to the astounding natural beauty of the place, which is a stunning backdrop for 11000 years of human history. Rolling mountains, spewing geysers, and live volcanoes combine with salt flats and windswept canyons to create an otherworldly atmosphere. From the ancient site of its first inhabitants to the present day caretakers who are passionate about its preservation: the community here celebrates its past, leaving all who pass through with the awareness that this is a truly sacred place. Catch a steamy sunrise at the Geysers del Tatio, float weightless in the ice hot waters of Cejar salt lagoon, take flight over the Atacama Desert and skim the rim of an active volcano, sandboard the steep dunes of Death Valley, join the wild ride down a mountain from a 5600 meter peak and watch the sun set over the lunar landscape of the Valley of the Moon.<br />

    </h3>
      
        
          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by flying_pig</i>: Backpacking / Touring South America?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m trying to put together very basic plans for backpacking through South America from the UK; hopefully to see as many countries as possible with a couple of friends; hopefully next year sometime. I have a few questions:</p>
<p>How long is needed to see a wide variety of things; i.e. A few Brazilian cities, Argentina, Boliva, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Colombia &#038; Venzuela? Was thinking 2.5months.</p>
<p>Is Colombia safe? What about Bogata?</p>
<p>Is it worth visiting Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Ecuador ? Whats the best things in each of these &#038; are they safe?</p>
<p>Would it be too hard/costly to head towards Cental America?</p>
<p>How much would it cost/how long would it take to visit the following; Easter Island, Galapagos Islands or Falkland Islands? And would any be worth while visiting?</p>
<p>Would US a day be enough to get by on for 2 or 3 months without to much of a struggle?</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, as I say just starting planning just now to see who wants to go with me.<br />
And almost forgot; when would be the best time of year to go?</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by Jenny V</i><br/>From what I know, Colombia is your biggest issue. I was in Ecuador and wanted to visit Colombia via bus, but all my local friends said that it is dangerous and difficult to enter in this way, and I could not afford to fly. However, many of my <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> friends made the trip and they were safe. Just stick to the tourist areas and watch your pockets. </p>
<p>If you visit Ecuador, look into visiting Montanita (a hippy beach town 3 hours from Guayaquil) or Banos (a sports mecca in the mountains, 3 hours from Quito). Ecuador is beautiful and has a lot to offer. </p>
<p>As for money,  is plenty! You can be low budget and safe for much less. I have stayed in hostels in south america for less than  a night. </p>
<p>Hope that helped a bit. Enjoy your trip!</p>

ok il try and make it short&#8230;<br />
last year me 15 him 19&#8230;<br />
he was all over me telling me how he likes me and kept on asking me out, kept on saying no cuz he was older but he kept on telling me that age didn&#8217;t matter&#8230;<br />
i went on a <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> to europe for month and a half he kept sending me email and being so sweet toward me and kept saying how he misses me&#8230;<br />
i came back lost my virginity to him and after he told me he didn&#8217;t want a serious relationship but only &#8220;FWB&#8221; at first i said no way and then he kept on pressuring me into it so i fell for it&#8230;<br />
i stupidly grew more and more feelings for him eventhough we never hung out much only for sex and only talked through msn and he never used to txt me but kept on making lies how he doesn&#8217;t have credit or he lost his phone&#8230;<br />
this year he saw me after school and came by to see me and it was all good but then the next day he said he didn&#8217;t want anything to do with me because i looked so young in my uniform and he said how he thinks i have feelings for him and he doesn&#8217;t want that because he feels bad&#8230;<br />
i got angry and then we met up we had sex and the next day i found out he blocked me on msn&#8230; and he did all that before his trip to south america&#8230;<br />
then through a friend i found out he has a girlfriend and has been with her for 2 years already and he went to see her because she went there for uni to study dance, and that he also has a father who lives in chile&#8230;<br />
i feel so foolish for falling for him and his stupidity, my heart is broken and i don&#8217;t know what to do it&#8217;s been 4 months since i found out about his girlfriend and i still can&#8217;t get over it&#8230; </p>
<p>can someone please tell me why he did this to me? he made me feel important and special and he used me when he was with his girlfriend&#8230; why? =(<br />
also our FWB relationship has been going on for a year</p>

Why do Charles Windsor and David Cameron go to the artic for a blast on snowmobiles  {great fun for them and their hangers on, free too !!} or to the Galapagos yet tell us that only the rich, famous or important  people {like wot they are} should be able to do the same? </p>
<p>I would like to do both trips myself. I would like it even more if it was &#8216;in works time&#8217; , free and indeed, as it is on works time, I got paid {plus &#8216;overtime} for going too, plus expenses, plus &#8216;spending money&#8217; etc etc etc .</p>
<p>Double standards or what?</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t Charles  &#038; Cameron stay in London and say this?  </p>
<p>See below for Charles&#8217;s latest Jolly. He&#8217;s even taken the Mrs.</p>

<p>Prince Charles was to head Monday to the Galapagos Islands on the final leg of a 10-day South <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> tour highlighting his commitment to battling climate change.

<p>Have your say: Royal Family</p>
<p>The prince, accompanied by his wife Camilla, arrived in the Ecuadoran capital Quito on Sunday ahead of their flight to the archipelago, a pristine nature reserve which inspired Charles Darwin in his theory of evolution.</p>
<p>Unlike on his previous stops, in Chile and <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a>, the heir to the throne was not greeted by Ecuador&#8217;s President Rafael Correa.</p>
<p>Instead, Vice President Lenin Moreno and Foreign Minister Fander Falconi did the honors.</p>
<p>Ecuador&#8217;s government used the prince&#8217;s presence to reiterate its ambition of receiving millions of dollars in foreign &#8220;compensation&#8221; for not exploiting oil reserves located in a national park.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prince Charles was content with the Ecuadoran initiative that promotes a form of environmental conservation, and expressed his hopes that the project become reality,&#8221; Moreno said.</p>
<p>Charles and Camilla were to be accompanied to the Galapagos by Ecuador&#8217;s environment minister, Marcela Aguinaga.<br />
And why are Prince Charles pockets sooooooooooooooooooooooooo deep?</p>
<p>He has no more earned his ££££££££ Millions  than Bernire Madoff or &#8216;Sir Fred&#8217; of the RBS !!</p>
<p>And, as I say, he could make the point without leaving blighty, ditto Cameron.</p>
<p>Perhaps u should  have spent more time reporting double standards ?</p>
<p>I find it all q funny mind !!</p>
<p>Both guys are right of course !!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>but its the</p>

<p>v v v v  v v v v v v v v v very wrong !</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by kerangoumar</i><br/>first of all charles probably is paying out of one of his many deep pockets.</p>
<p>secondly, sometimes it takes having a well-known, celebrated or powerful figure in one&#8217;s country to bring home that other people are concerned about what is happening here.  and if that figure is bringing to light a positive action that might otherwise be overlooked, so much the better. you can read about that in the news report you pasted into your question.</p>

<p><i>Answer by Lumber</i><br/>I don&#8217;t know about any actual resorts, but San Carlos de Bariloche in Argentina is beautiful. I went in the summer (no snow) but it was still gorgeous. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you want to/can afford to go so far south but Ushuaia is BEAUTIFUL! And, it&#8217;s the last city before Antarctica. You can ski at El Fin Del Mundo (The end of the earth).

<p>Mendoza is also a great place, the wine country of Argentina, surrounded by the Andes.</p>
<p>Hope that helps some&#8230;</p>

There are 2.3 million people living in America with no car and without a supermarket within a one-mile radius. People living in these &#8220;food deserts&#8221; are often obese and unhealthy because they&#8217;re stuck eating junk food from the convenience store. Slate has prepared an interactive map of the counties with the most people who live in food deserts as defined above. They&#8217;re clustered mostly in &#8230;<br />

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by Dr No</i>: Can I travel around Patagonia without a guide or tour? Not hike or off beaten track. I am fit 71 year young.?</strong><br />
I have a reservation to cruise Antarctica from Argentina and return. I want to see what Patagonia looks like, but guided tours are very expensive. I bought guide books and maps and it looks like I can travel around easily by rental car or by local buses and airliness. This is in mid-Dec. beginning of summer there. Have frequent flyer miles from USA by way of Santiagoc Chile or Buenos Aires, Arg. I do not want hosteling, trekking, sharing rooms, camping. I speak pretty good Spanish &#038; was in north of Argentina 35 years ago, driving an <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> car alone. No problems.  If you have done this or read and heard stories about it, let me know what you think, but tell me your expertise. Lets say I have  00 on the high end and 00 on the low ended.  I really prefer an escorted tour w/o a lot of <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/hiking/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with hiking">hiking</a>, but they are really expensive .  Thanks<br />
Ushuaia &#8211; This is where I am starting my trip. I see there are good rental car companies. Do you think it is better to rent a car or take buses around the region? Flying home, of course.<br />

<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by homeless</i><br/>I have traveled around Patagonia alone by bus. When it is summer there you have the opportunity to meet other lone travelers especially from Europe, Canada, and Australia and more and more from Japan doing the same. Being you know enough Spanish you should not have much problem.</p>

<p>I ride and I record. There&#8217;s no editing of video&#8217;s when I&#8217;m back at home, my video&#8217;s are all edited on the road because I want to share my experiences as they happen, so&#8230; Follow my journey through North, Central and South America. I&#8217;ve jacked in the job, packed my life into a pair of panniers and a roll bag and tied them down to a BMW F650 Dakar. Now it&#8217;s time for some fun. In this episode I ride through Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica until I reach the end of the road in Panama. I endure extortion at the hand or corrupt border officials in Honduras after I was unable to gain the correct paperwork for my motorcycle when I crossed the border from El Salvador. Remind me never to return to Honduras!

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by beauteimparfait</i>: all inclusive travel packages to south america?</strong><br />
I am looking for a travel package for a mother (42) and a daughter (16). Preferably in a nice hotel with a spa and such. But there needs to be some adventure/exploring. Like in the rainforests or to historical sites (aztecs, myans, etc). It would also be really cool if there was a sort of flea market type thing. Does anyone know of anything like this or any all inclusive packages to south/central america?</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by Christine</i><br/>Does it have to be all-inclusive?  I booked my last Argentina <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/vacation/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with vacation">vacation</a> with a travel agent who got us the hotel, transfers, international flights, domestic flights (we went to Iguazu, Buenos Aires, and Mendoza) within Argentina, and a few tours.  The rest we just paid for ourselves when we got there.  If you google travel agent and the area you want to go to (like Peru, Colombia, etc.), you&#8217;ll find ones that specialize and can book almost everything for you in advance.</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by C&#8217;est..La..Vie</i>: How could i organise a charity trip around south america?</strong><br />
Well i am at the basic stage of an idea to travel through each country of south america for charity, i want to do something different so need a real new idea which stands out so i make good money fundraising. How much would it cost to live in south america ( i know its hard to say due to the different countries) But roughly the living costs per day? how much would it cost to buy an old car? how much is petrol? If anyone knows any information i would be very very grateful! ~I want to get this idea up and running</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by Olga C</i><br/>first of all that&#8217;s a very good idea!!!<br />
per day depending on where you live i would say about no more than 30 USD an old car is about 00 for a decent used car. The gas is the same as the US but in soles, pesos, etc the rest i don&#8217;t really knoe sorry.</p>

<p>This clip was shot in the South of Colombia after four days of torrential rain. I was riding from Tierradentro to San Agustin and had to cross this slippery and swaying bamboo bridge with my bike fully loaded because the regular road bridge had collapsed or washed away. The river water was a matter of inches beneath me, and I wasn&#8217;t happy about making the crossing but some Colombians at the entrance to the bridge encouraged me to attempt it. I had the foresight to turn my helmet camera on!

    </h3>
      
        
          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by Andrea</i>: Layover in San Salvador?</strong><br />
We are a family of 4, traveling to South America (Uruguay) for the holidays. All 4 carry a US Passport. We have an all-day lay-over in El Salvador. I wonder if for a small fee, lower than the usual immigration fees required to stay in the country, we can be let out of the airport to do some sightseeing so that the kids don&#8217;t get bored? We&#8217;ve done that in Panama in the past&#8230;<br />
I want to share accurate information I was able to obtain in case anyone else needs help on this same issue.<br />
After some research, I contacted the agency in charge of immigration/customs at the airport, the &#8220;Comision Ejecutiva Portuaria Autonoma&#8221;.<br />
This is their reply:</p>
<p>&#8220;Respondiendo a su interrogante,  si es posible salir del aeropuerto, acatando las siguientes recomendaciones:</p>
<p>Reportarse con el oficial de migración e informar que es pasajero de trasbordo o transito el cual le informara que deberá de llenar formularios correspondientes.<br />
No deberá de salir con ningún equipaje salvo el personal o de mano.<br />
Al momento de ingresar deberá de hacerlo directamente al área de ingreso a salas (abordaje), no debiendo pasar por counter.</p>
<p>Actualmente no se realiza ningún tipo de cobro a pasajeros trasbordo en este aeropuerto y si su estadía es menor a 8 horas no tendrá que pagar derecho de embarque.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by kma</i><br/>A friend wrote this so I can&#8217;t take credit but  has the info you need.<br />
you will have to pay 10.00 per person for tourist card.<br />
Hope this help.</p>
<p>I live in El Salvador, and I just came from a trip and took a taxi (a pickup really) from the ACOBAM company to go to my home. I used the time to ask my driver, Yaster Portillo (Cel. (503) 7936-7186) if he had serviced tourists waiting in the airport on long layovers.</p>
<p>He told me that yes, he has done that. The rate is $ 25 to visit a place, and then $ 25 back. If you want him to wait for you, an hour or two &#8211; for example for lunch, add $ 10 extra (if you don&#8217;t want the driver to hang around, you can tell him to pick you up later at a prearranged time and save the $ 10). If you need more waiting time, add another $ 10.00 extra.</p>
<p>He gave me examples of places he has driven people to, for example:</p>
<p>1) To the La Libertad port town for lunch (there are many restaurants with seafood, fish, etc).<br />
You can visit the pier where they sell fish &#8211; smelly place!</p>
<p>2) To the capital of San Salvador, for example to see the cathedral. He told me about an <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">american</a> couple that went to the cathedral, then to sample Mondongo soup at a small market at Merliot suburb &#8211; but it looked a bit greasy and the couple had a fried fish and liked it. Then they went to Panchimalco (not much to see apart from the colonial church) and it was $ 75.00 for the 5 hours it took roundtrip from the airport.</p>
<p>3) To sample pupusas at a nearby town of Olocuilta. (pupusas are the national dish of El Salvador). He told me that the company charges the same $ 25 to, $ 25 from, $ 10 to wait. Many people find this not just, as Olocuilta is closer than the capital city and they charge the same, but that is the company policy &#8211; but he told me that you might haggle and get the round trip for pupusas lunch for $ 30.00 total.</p>
<p>There is also a Tourist card fee of $ 10.00.</p>
<p>So, you may have options when waiting hours and hours for a layover at the El Salvador Airport (known as Comalapa Airport).</p>

<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by John M</i><br/>First of all, your sense of geography is incorrect. Nicaragua is not in South America. Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the Central <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> countries from Guatemala to Panama are all part of North America. </p>
<p>http://www.studyzone.org/testprep/ss5/b/comcontocintrol.cfm</p>
<p>http://www.mapability.com/ei8ic/maps/continents.gif</p>
<p>In terms of finding a mission trip, there are a lot of mission trips that go to Nicaragua and other countries year-round. Most of these mission trips are with faith-based groups, but there are also general non-faith based organizations that have operations in Nicaragua. Organizations work actively in rural communities more so than urban ones. Your best bet is to do a google search and look for &#8220;Mission Trips to Nicaragua.&#8221; Once you find one that matches your interests, get in contact with those in charge and arrange your travel and accommodations as required.</p>

<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by SouthAmericanPostcard</i><br/>Peru and Argentina are much cheaper than <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a> and Chile. In Peru and Argentina you will need if you stay in hostels and budget hotels about USD per day give or take a few dollars depending on what you like to do.

<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by markysparky</i><br/>Yes you may. You would have to sponsor him in US. Check their website to familiarise yourself with the Law. Follow the law to the letter and you will be ok. There are strict rules to follow and if you don&#8217;t-end of your honeymoon. Go to the local Consulate and ask.</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by sdaddy</i>: what are the best <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> spots in South America to travel with an 10 month old?</strong><br />
I&#8217;d like to visit either Peru or <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a> in November (Thanksgiving time).  But I am concerned on whether it is safe to go there with my 8 month old baby.  I&#8217;ve heard that the altitude in Machu Picchu might make it tough for a baby to breathe, and I personally think that the Amazon won&#8217;t be safe either.  So I&#8217;d like to know of other baby friendly places to visit in the area where the entire family can have a good time.  All suggestions are welcome! Thanks</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by Ryunkin</i><br/>I think you had best bone up on the politics of the countries in South America. <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a> is relatively safe and does have modern medical care if needed. However, the country is plagued by gang violence. So if you go, I would strictly stay in the el touristo mode. In other words, I would not stray from the beaten path. </p>
<p>Argentina is another relatively safe country to visit and is the SA country that&#8217;s most similar to the US. I would be careful traveling around the countryside however, because its real estate ads use proximity to a police station as a selling point. That should tell you something.</p>
<p>Uruguay, like Argentina, is a very Europe nation and is very safe, compared to other South <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> countries. Montevideo also has wonderful beaches and beautiful people. With an 8 month old baby you might not be interested in beautiful people&#8230;but then again.</p>
<p>Chile is also safe and it has an interesting area to the south that is reminiscent of Switzerland but with volcanoes. You&#8217;ll also find a lot of ex-Nazis there, so if fascism isn&#8217;t your thing, you might not want to bring up your egalitarian beliefs. </p>
<p>Other than these four countries, I would not want to visit the rest, much less with a baby. Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela, Columbia and Paraguay are political nightmares with revolutions and violence a constant everyday occurrence. If I was in a suicidally adventurous mood, which happens to me every twenty years or so, I would venture it, but definitely not with an infant. </p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m partial to Buenas Aires because of its Parisian atmosphere the tango. But that&#8217;s just little old sophisticated me. I hope I been of some use.</p>

The people, everything about it, turned any preconceptions on their head</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by duckwing</i><br/>Most of the heavy travelers I know would rather stay home on holidays. They travel domestically and globally almost 5 days a week. It gets old real fast.      Some people are fascinated by history.      Others are excited by art and architecture.      Some like to learn about other cultures, especially things gastronomic      Others like to shop anyplace other than where they live.      Some like majestic natural beauty.      Others like pretty much anything exotic.    I don’t know this; but, I am guessing that the people being interviewed are of those who like the exotic. My English family is similar. They like to travel to Africa, India, China, Vietnam, etc.</p>
<p>Now that India, China, and Vietnam no longer are that exotic, why not experience the genocide trials in Cambodia or sneak into Burma and contribute to several political blogs? Or, better yet, why not visit nations ruled by dictators and generally viewed as scourges by the West? Iran and Syria come to mind. Iraq is at least as interesting; but, there is the small complication of the ongoing war. That doesn’t stop some travellers whose thirst for the exotic takes them to war zones and generally creates agita for their country’s diplomats operating in the war zone.</p>
<p>The amount of history and art to be found in Iran, Iraq, and Syria is mind numbing. But, I don’t sense that either is the primary motivation of these travelers. I see them as simply adding exciting, exotic notches to their belts&#8230;sort of like bungee jumping or sky diving.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that there aren’t more opportunities to combine vacationing with social action. For example, spend a 4 week <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/vacation/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with vacation">vacation</a> traveling to Eastern Chad and volunteer to help out in a refugee camp full of Darfuris displaced by Sudanese soldiers or their agents. Or travel to Pakistan and work in Afghani refugee camps. Those would be both exciting/exotic and value creating.</p>
<p>Some of my family members have traveled to Iran, before the revolution in the late 1970s. Isfahan is indeed more beautiful than described. But, I don’t realistically see me making it there or to Iraq or Syria either&#8230;unless I somehow can whip myself into shape and get a position as an over the hill Ranger or something&#8230;</p>
<p>I love to travel for pleasure. I have had considerable opportunities to do so to date. It can be especially mind expanding for kids who otherwise would grow up with fairly narrow world experiences. But, I find pleasure in the mundane destinations at least as much in the exotic. It is more important to me to be clear about what the purpose of the travel is and to make sure it is shared with fellow travelers. That way, if the goal is to take in history, everyone is aligned with that objective and there shouldn’t be too much griping when touring the 13th archaeological site in one week. On the other hand, if the goal is to take in the culture and arts, one could spend a very different trip to the same general destination&#8211;taking in language, the people, the cuisine, the music, its dance, etc. This doesn’t need to be done in Sub Saharan Africa. This could be equally enjoyable in Paris or Florence or even London, perish the thought&#8230;  <img src='http://holidays.bz/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

The nation&#8217;s economic stress fell in September to a 16-month low, thanks to more hiring in New England, fewer foreclosures in the mid-Atlantic and declining bankruptcy filings in the Southeast, according to The Associated Press&#8217; monthly analysis of conditions around the country.<br />

I am looking to travel around Argentina for 8 days in February 2010, with 3 other friends. I will fly from Rio de Janeiro where I will be living. I know flights for this are around 400 return. How much can i expect to spend if we want to take a bus to places and see iguaza falls (or however you spell it) and places like that? How much will it cost to enter and drink at a club? and how much can i expect to spend on food and entertainment during these 8 days? Hostels inclued..<br />
thanks for the answer, but im looking for general living in Argentina, how much would it cost to feed myself for a day on the street (not a restuarant) i am looking for people to tell me prices of general living, e.g.buses, food on the street etc thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by Baires</i><br/>Hello,</p>
<p>Flights to Iguazu are around 0 USD, the bus is around 0 USD, but takes a LONG time&#8230; drinks in a club are around 7USD, food depends, its anything from -USD, bakeries are usually a good cheap option! Hostels in BA are around USD a night, but cheaper in the provinces&#8230;</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by alfajorNYC</i>: Where do I donate a toy for a child right after Christmas and Chanukah? Three Kings Day?</strong><br />
It seems that right after Christmas that many kids get toys that they don&#8217;t need or want.  Instead of returning them, someone could donate them to a child who didn&#8217;t get any toys on Christmas Day.  There ARE twelve days of Christmas, after all (and eight days of Chanukah)!  Moreover, since there are so many sales right after Christmas Day (like Boxing Day sales in Canada and the UK), people could get toys cheaper in order to donate more.  I am in NYC and cannot seem to find a place to give a new gift to a needy child.  Many <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/latin/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with latin">Latin</a> countries (Italy, <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/spain/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with spain">Spain</a>, Central and South America), celebrate Three Kings Day, another Christmastime <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> on January 6th, when gifts are given.  The twelve days of Christmas end with the Feast of Epiphany also called &#8220;The Adoration of the Magi&#8221; or &#8220;The Manifestation of God.&#8221; This could be another option for gift-giving.<br />
By the way, why don&#8217;t  Canadians and Americans start celebrating the season on Christmas Eve and end with Three Kings Day?  There is all of this pre-<a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> hype that begins right after Thanksgiving (and sometimes even before Halloween!), yet Christmas ends for most on Christmas Day, or maybe a couple of days of celebration afterwards if at all.  Why not boycott the pre-<a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> hype and shopping frenzy by returning to the traditional celebration of Christmas which ends with the Feast of the Epiphany/The Adoration of the Magi/The Manifestation of God &#8212; aka Three Kings Day (on January 6th)?

This Sunday I wasn’t working and wasn’t out of town, so I went climbing at Owen’s Rock in Adams County. This was my first time climbing this year, so I was a little apprehensive about how I would do.Â We chose to climb at Owen’s Rock because it is only about an hour drive from Marshfield.<br />

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by xx HR. UK</i>: Where abouts is a good destination for horse riding holidays?</strong><br />
I am almost 18 years old and am particularly interested in going on a horse riding <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a>. I was wondering if there are any places, abroad in particular, which are advisable and if they have websites which i could look at. It would be a plus if they weren&#8217;t extortionate.</p>
<p>I am mainly interested in countryside places, but would also thoroughly enjoy a warm place possibly with beach rides? America is also a big attraction but i realise this would be expensive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would also like to find a destination which may have other leisure activities or restaurants in the surrounding area which may entertain a 21 year old male. These do not have to be in vast amounts because lovely scenery would probably settle this.</p>
<p>I am aware that horse riding holidays abroad wouldn&#8217;t be cheap, so I am willing to consider picturesque destinations in the UK. Which would be recommended?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m from South Yorkshire and i don&#8217;t mind travelling if we remain in the UK, but hopefully no longer than a 5 hour car drive.<br />
Thanks alot!</p>

I am I would like some expert/experienced advice here as I will be doing a multi terrain expedition. Mountain,Desert, Jungle. I will be more than likely taking a hammock for the jungle, with an attached mosi net.</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by Jenn J</i><br/>Check out the Eureka Apex 2 man tent. Its 2 kg, and easy to set up. And, its perfect in the rain &#8211; you won&#8217;t have to worry about getting wet in the least. And, it has clothes line and flashlight loops.</p>
<p>http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000EQCVQ6/comparisoncaf227-20</p>
<p>Otherwise go with a Coleman Sundome tent. It is a bit heavier, but roomier. It&#8217;s a solid tent at a lower price. http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001C1A362/comparisoncaf227-20</p>
<p>Go check the reviews on the Eureka though &#8211; you won&#8217;t be disappointed, especially for the adventure you&#8217;re taking!</p>

Great dinning and nightlife. Very secure. Expensive but the best. First class. If you want to have great holidays with amazing goodlooking girls all over, extremely save for families, great dinning, upscale people, beautifull beaches, excellent infrastructure. The best months to go are January and February.<br />

<p>This video shows you a little bit of Quito&#8217;s splendor. Quito is possibly the most beautiful capital in South America. Spread across a spectacular Andean valley with volcanic peaks in the background, Quitos setting alone is enough to leave you speechless. The old town is a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1978 and is incredibly beautiful. All the churches and colonial buildings have been restored and is in use which makes the city come alive with the vibrant working class and indigenous character that has always defined it. Walking its narrow streets is to wander into another world. The old time is also the best place to find a guesthouse. It is both the cheatpest and safest place to stay in Quito (if you can call Quito safe :-/) Merely a 20-minute walk from the old town, Quitos new town is a different world; a mixture of hotels, high-rises and government complexes. Many travelers head to Mariscal Sucre, which has trendy cafés, international restaurants, travel agencies, cybercafés, bars and small hotels. The area&#8217;s nickname is gringolandia (gringo land), but quiteños (people from Quito) like it too. It is, however, a lot more dangerous to walk here after dark than in the old part &#8211; so be aware.<br />

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by J C</i>: The best <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> in the world&#8230; for me. AKA, where on Earth shall I take a much-needed <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a>?</strong><br />
Obviously I don&#8217;t just want a load of random suggestions: I&#8217;d like some well-travelled users&#8217; informed opinions based on my personal preferences, so here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>I live in the UK.</p>
<p>I love to do exciting things on my holidays.</p>
<p>I also would also like to relax a little on this <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a>.</p>
<p>I really want to learn SCUBA diving and put it into practice immediately.</p>
<p>I am extremely arachnophobic.</p>
<p>I like driving and unusual train and ship journeys.</p>
<p>I love ancient cultures like the Egyptians and particularly the Aztecs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in Pirates.</p>
<p>I really want to see Macchu Piccu, but am worried about encountering gigantic arachnids (this does not sound like an enjoyable <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> to me).</p>
<p>I have been to Mexico and don&#8217;t fancy going somewhere I&#8217;ve been to&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also already been to Japan, China, US Tri-state area, Minnesota, California, Nevada, Florida, Italy, <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/spain/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with spain">Spain</a>, France, Greece, Germany, India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Tunisia, Ontario, and Sweden.</p>
<p>I have never been to South America and really want to, but reently found out about the huge spiders. Would love to see the Amazon: fat chance of that now though.</p>
<p>I hear Thailand is incredible, but that there are also many spiders everywhere.</p>
<p>I want an amazing <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> experience with beautiful views, good weather, amazing culture, SCUBA-learning opportunities, adventure outings.. and preferably no spiders!</p>
<p>I know, toughie, huh?</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice, in advance. (No, I won&#8217;t get hypnotherapy but I am trying to overcome it without it.)</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by stephen J</i>: I want to travel to South America for 3 months. What level of spanish should I be at?</strong><br />
On of my primary reasons for going would be to learn more spanish in a total immersion environment. That, and my love of traveling abroad and adventure! I just want to know, should I be at level 3, and I will learn more as I go, or should I have, like, 8 years under my belt? I am planning on touring the continent a fair bit&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by Silver529</i><br/>I think level 3 is a great way to go! I actually went to Mexico when I was level 1 and still understood most things going on about (even those gossiping about me).</p>
<p>I think going to South America will be a great trip to learn spanish, if you dont get it all right away you will definetly learn most of it there.</p>
<p>Hope I helped!</p>

    </h3>
      
        
          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by kdcsoccerfreak</i>: How many of these things have you done?!?!?!?</strong><br />
1. Set foot on each of the seven continents. Antarctica might be a tough one, but once you’ve reached all seven you can truly call yourself a world traveler.</p>
<p>2. Cross a country on a bicycle. A bicycle tour takes some planning, but it beats being separated from a country though a passenger-side window. </p>
<p>3. Ride something bigger than a horse. Trekking through the jungle on the back of a two story tall elephant will surely be something you remember forever. </p>
<p>4. Live like a local for a month. The experience of visiting native peoples will give you way more insight into another way of life than two years hopping from one backpacker ghetto to the next.</p>
<p>5. Visit a “real” blues bar in Chicago. What better way to leave music’s commercialism behind and find the soul of the blues?</p>
<p>6. Learn another language. This is definitely a weighty and time-consuming proposition, but there are plenty of resources out there to ease the process. </p>
<p>7. Go heli-skiing. The access to snow and terrain via heli is different (read: better) that anything else you’ll ever experience.</p>
<p>8. Travel India by train. With its extensive rail network, this mode of transport is the best way to see one of the world’s most colorful and diverse countries.</p>
<p>9. Climb one of the world’s Seven Summits. Climbing mountains is not for the faint-hearted, but everyone has had a dream of standing atop one. </p>
<p>10. Dive with a whale shark. Swimming with these gentle giants is among the most powerful wilderness experiences in the world.</p>
<p>11. Participate in a Carnival parade in <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a>. You haven’t had a good night out until you’ve been to the biggest party in a nation of big parties.</p>
<p>12. Dance Tango in Argentina.</p>
<p>13. Surf. It’s not about being a ripper but just catching waves.</p>
<p>14. SCUBA in the Great Barrier Reef. The largest coral reef in the world is a must for dive enthusiasts. It is the world’s most unique aquatic environment. </p>
<p>15. Publish an article about your travels. Part of traveling is sharing your experiences with others. Plus, getting published might be easier than you think. </p>
<p>Photo by Creative Corners<br />
16. Volunteer abroad for a month. </p>
<p>17. Follow in the footsteps of your favorite travel book. What better guide than a book that inspired you to travel in the first place?</p>
<p>18. Take a bush plane ride into Africa’s interior. These lightly visited regions are filled with unique cultures and diverse wildlife. </p>
<p>19. Cross a glacier on foot. Traversing these fast-disappearing natural wonders is an adventure that future generations might not be able to experience. </p>
<p>20. Visit the source of one of the world’s great rivers. Great rivers, like the Nile, have humble beginnings.</p>
<p>21. Climb an active volcano. </p>
<p>22. Buy a boat and learn to sail. Before the Brothers Wright, everyone traveled by wind power. It’s still the most sustainable way to travel there is. </p>
<p>23. Follow your food from field to table. Most people in the world still eat what they have picked with their own hands. Why not get back to these basics?</p>
<p>24. Bathe in the Ganges. What better way to experience the spiritual heart of India? </p>
<p>25. Travel around the world. Sure, you could do this without ever setting foot outside of planes and airports, but few people ever truly traverse the entire globe. Round the world tickets are great for budget-minded wanderers. </p>

26. Photograph an endangered species. Aside from an image you can keep for a lifetime, it will remind you, and others, how fragile life can be.</p>
<p>27. Participate in Burning Man . As they say: “Trying to explain Burning Man to someone who has never been is like trying to explain color to a blind person.”</p>
<p>28. Spend 24 hours alone in the jungle.</p>
<p>29. Learn how to make a national dish. What is the one and only thing that everyone has in common? Eating.</p>
<p>30. Teach English in a foreign country. Sure, it’s a way to fund your travels, but also the experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p>31. Attend a music festival in another country. </p>
<p>32. Cross a country using only public transportation. See a country the way most of its people do: from the window of a bus, train, or ferry. </p>
<p>33. Spend the night in a storied/historic hotel. You might not even have to leave town to experience a night of classic atmosphere. </p>
<p>34. Attend the Olympics. Whatever you say about the commercialism of the Olympic Games, they are one of the biggest events on the planet. </p>
<p>35. Meet your favorite (living) travel writer. They’ve inspired you; now thank them for it. </p>
<p>36. Travel to Germany to experience Love Parade. It’s one of the biggest festivals, attendance-wise, on the planet. </p>

37. Partake in a Japanese Tea Ceremony. This timeless tradition is at the heart of Japanese culture. </p>
<p>38. Join a caravan in the Sahara. See how people can thrive in one of the world’s harshest environments. </p>
<p>39. Go to Oktoberfest. The meeting of over 6 million beer afficionados and dr<br />
Right noe Nikole is in the lead!<br />
How about these?</p>
<p>40. Stand at the North or South Pole. </p>
<p>41. Be in the stands when two rival South <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> club teams play each other in soccer. Soccer (sorry, football) is a passion for most of the world’s population. </p>
<p>42. Visit the birthplace or gravesite of a cultural icon. Could be Che Guevara or Picasso or Levi Strauss or the guy who invented widgets; anyone you think is important. </p>
<p>43. Find your version of “The Beach.” One of the best travel books ever inspired a generation of backpackers. Why not find your own version of untouched paradise?</p>
<p>44. Enjoy a freshly rolled cigar in Cuba. Taste a hand rolled specialty close to its source. </p>
<p>45. Visit every capital city in Europe. The crowded continent is full of beautiful architecture and diverse cultures.</p>
<p>46. Watch an orchestral performance in Vienna. </p>

<p>48. Bike the Pacific Coast Highway.<br />

<p>49. Shake hands with someone who has truly changed a country. </p>

I&#8217;m planning to visit South America this year for the second time round.

Any suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by not_so_old_55</i><br/>If you stay in the major cities such as Bogota, Lima, Santiago, Quito, etc. you will find that the western hotels are very common.  As far as commercially developed, I think Colombia or Chile are your choices.</p>

IT was June, the height of the Nicaraguan rainy season, and the sky was thick with clouds. Our small boat cut south through the wind-churned Pacific, rounding one bend, then another. The looming hills were green with shrubby trees and coastal grasses; where they met the water, layers of rock folded like cake frosting into the ocean. Soon a wide bay opened up and the surf-and-sand boomtown of San &#8230;<br />

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by Beep_n_co</i>: How safe is it for a mixed black and white family to travel round the <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> South?</strong><br />
We are from UK and want to <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> in the US south.  Have I watched too many movies about how difficult it can be in the South? Can a mixed family have a fly drive <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> in the Southern States in comfort and safety &#8211; or do we just have to stay in the tourist spots of Orlando?  We want to visit Tn, Ms, Al, Ga.  We want to be able to travel around freely &#8211; normal safety precautions applied &#8211; to visit some of old mansions as well as areas of importance for the civil rights movement.  Any advice on where to go or not to go, whether or not we will face difficulties?  Many thanks.  Beep n co.<br />
Thank you all for your replies.  I am obviously v. cynical or paranoid. Sadly off remarks happen! I want to visit small towns but Mom&#8217;s advice is don&#8217;t. If a white family went on hols, they would expect to chat to others and go around with impunity n have a good time. I would like the same.  People are coming back saying they are shocked at my question and discrimination is against the law.  Its a great theory, but the reality for a black person is discrimination overt, covert, direct n indirect are a fact of daily life. Hence my question, how safe is a mixed family the south?  I dont expect to be attacked, but I expect some unpleasantness.  I want to minimise that so my family can see learn and enjoy the south and its people.</p>

<p><i>Answer by spyker_roughie</i><br/>Do whatever you want. No one can show you any kind of discrimination, it&#8217;s simply against the law.</p>

<p>This is an amazing trip to take if you are spending your holidays in Thailand. 2 km of zip lines take you from platform to platform high up in the rainforest canopy. There are also two day adventure tours you can combine Flight of the Gibbon with including mountain biking, rock climbing and white water rafting. Stay up on the moutain village in a homestay in between your days. It really is a way to make your holidays in Thailand unique and unforgettable. In case you are wondering&#8230;it&#8217;s called &#8220;Flight of the Gibbon&#8221; because it mimics the way gibbon primates travel in these forests. www.treetopasia.com<br />

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by Jason D</i>: Why is domestic (inter-South Ameirca) air travel so damn expensive?</strong><br />
Hi, I am in the process of booking my local flights in South America for my <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> in March and I can&#8217;t get over how expensive travel is in South America, its over 0usd just to get a flight from Lima to Guayaquil (a short flight) and was going to cost me 0usd+ from Argentina to Ecuador. I have shopped around and seen these are the going rates.</p>
<p>Back to my question &#8211; Are these rates because of the lower quantity of people flying in ratio to the populations of these countries? My theory on these prices is the more proportional people fly in richer countries.. the more competition there hence cheaper airfares. I am from New Zealand and Australia and my return ticket to South America is almost the same as a ticket from Argentina to Ecuador (and that&#8217;s only one way too!)&#8230;  I know in the countries I&#8217;ve travelled (Europe, UK, New Zealand, Australia, Asia).. air travel is cheap comparatively. I know this is a silly question.. but being a pilot this interests me and but I would love to hear some other thoughts. Thanks, Jason.</p>

MP In Jungle Cocaine Search Drama</p>
<p>LONDON (Reuters) &#8211; A British MP trekking in Colombia was held at gunpoint in the jungle and forced to eat coffee whitener from a jar in his backpack after soldiers mistook it for cocaine.</p>
<p>Michael Fabricant was on a walking <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> in South America with a friend when they were stopped by a group of gun-toting men in camouflage uniforms.</p>
<p>The soldiers found a container full of coffee whitener in their bags and immediately suspected it was drugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to demonstrate that it wasn&#8217;t cocaine, I had to take a whole pile of it and throw it down my throat,&#8221; the Conservative member for Lichfield in Staffordshire told BBC television.</p>
<p>&#8220;They waited a few minutes to see whether I collapsed or went delirious and said something completely ridiculous like &#8216;Gordon Brown&#8217;s got a great personality&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I didn&#8217;t say anything too weird, they came to the conclusion that it wasn&#8217;t the case and they let me go.&#8221;</p>
<p>His explanation for putting powdered whitener in Colombian coffee, regarded as among the best in the world, will be familiar to many Brits abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to be a little bit careful about what you eat,&#8221; he said.</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by nickjames_88</i>: How much did you spend backpacking South America?</strong><br />
Basically wanting details on which countries you visited, how long you visited, and how much you spend in total. And gossip about the countries is fine too.</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by El fagguito</i><br/>Spent 2000 dollars on brasil, argentina, paraguay, uruguay and chile. Went there for a month with a friend. I left my main baggage with a family in buenos aires and took a small baggage for my excursions. Tipically i would take a bus to some city, tour it for 2 days and then left for another city. I returned to buenos aires about 3 times to get money and clothes.</p>
<p>Brasil: Its like venezuela.</p>
<p>Argentina: Gray and depressing since i went during the crisis. Meat and clothes were cheap, the south was beautiful.</p>
<p>Uruguay: Argentina lite.</p>
<p>Chile: More expensive than argentina. Santiago was gray and boring, the andes mountains and the south were great. Lots of snow, lakes and sky.</p>
<p>Paraguay: Paraguay has probably the worst tours of south america. Asuncion is ugly and boring.</p>

Backpacking from city to city, country to country in South America is inevitable and I need to get from place to place in the safest, cheapest, and most efficient way possible.  I know that each country and each city is different but if you could give me specifics concerning transportation for any country you know, or any general transportation for South America, please share your valued knowledge <img src='http://holidays.bz/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by blitzcrackunders</i><br/>I backpacked in Peru and Ecuador for over a month and let me tell you how great the buses are! (Most) are much nicer than the buses in the US I&#8217;ve been on! For the best over night buses make sure to get a bus-cama (bed-bus.) Also, for a little bit more money but a lot more convenience, you can cross the borders between some countries without changing buses (you get off the bus to get your visa and stamp and whatever but then get back on the same bus.) In Ecuador it was about  per hour and in Peru it was about  per hour. </p>
<p>I started in Ecuador, then went to Peru and I wanted to get back up quick so I took a 30 hour bus ride from Lima to Guayaquil. Just make sure if you&#8217;re taking such a long trip that you take the opportunities during stops to stretch out your legs and bring plenty of snacks and stuff to drink. Try to get a seat away from the bathroom because sometimes they smell.</p>
<p>Cruz del Sur is a very reliable company, but totally overpriced! Ormeno usually had good prices and the buses were comparable to Cruz del Sur&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Also! Get the travel guide called the Lonely Planet. You can get one for each country or one for all of South America (I got the whole South America one then realized afterward I should have just gotten the Peru and Ecuador one since those two would have been smaller than the whole one, lol.) I highly recommend it. It really helps you figure out how to get from city to city and some cheap options for hostels, bars, and restaurants. It also has basic things like how much a taxi should cost and great things to see in a lot of cities. Also tells you stuff like how long a bus trip takes from city to city within the same country or between major cities in different countries.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you want more advice on backpacking specifically through Peru or Ecuador, you can email me at bkovars &#8220;at&#8221; gmail &#8220;dot&#8221; com  <img src='http://holidays.bz/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

I really wanna see the world a bit so can anyone suggest somewhere say south america or asia. thanks guys and HAPPY NEW YEAR</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by Hey vampire girl!</i><br/>well, america or asia is going to cost a lot more than £1000, so is anything decent. You could do a package <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> to the south of france or something, but if you want to go further, then just the flights alone are going to cost you about £1000. Have you considered backpacking? If you went backpacking across Europe, then you would see loads of the world, and it would be a fantastic experience. You need to be physically fit though, but do some research online, and there are <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> groups that go backpacking, you could join them. All you have to pay for is some accommodation en-route, food and your gear. It is a lovely way to see the world. Have fun!</p>

Hi, I have got an advertising assignment where I have to create an advertisement for an adventure <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> in China. I was wondering what feature/service I could provide with my &#8220;adventure <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a>&#8221; that has not already been advertised by other companies?</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by dragonbreathfromjuno</i><br/>I think your adventure travel service should offer trips to Shipton&#8217;s Arch in Xinjiang, near Kashgar.  It is a very little-known and rarely visited place in a very remote region of the world, accessible by 4wd and a fairly long hike.  A guide would be necessary and it is the largest arch in the world. </p>
<p>If you want to offer something more, include long hikes with homestays with Uyghur shepherds in the Tian Shan mountains north of Kashgar.</p>

<p><i>Answer by memyselfandI</i><br/>Hello. I live in Australia and have studied in Australia. Best to start contacting your local Australian embassy in your country and ask for contacts/ideas. Next seach the web for &#8220;australian universities&#8221;. I definitely know that our ex Foreign Minister was really pushing for more overseas students to come to Australia. Top schools here are University of Melbourne, University of Sydney, University of NSW, Australian National University&#8230;really depend on which state you want to study in&#8230;if your a bit technical, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology is great&#8230;.the only downside to Australian Universities I think is that some of they are project work based&#8230;unlike <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a> universities you just memorise and do multiple choice tests etc&#8230;but it should be a great experience&#8230;.hands down!</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by parins</i>: what are the profit margins that travel planners / agents for leisure holidays make ?</strong><br />
i am thinking of starting a travel company which tailor makes holidays to exotic destinations in the world&#8230;africa / south america / asia / parts of europe&#8230;targetted to a more urban crowd ? what kind of money to travel agents make ? i know their survivial has become a lot tougher after the internet and websites like tripadvisor ?</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by Kelly Monaghan</i><br/>Actually, smart travel agents are thriving in the era of TripAdvisor and online booking engines. The key word in that sentence is &#8220;smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>The online booking sites have relieved travel agents of the least profitable bookings &#8212; those for cheap, point-to-point air and bargain basement trips. The most successful travel agents are specializing in high-ticket, high-margin travel products that are sold best person-to-person and by building relationships built on trust and expertise with customers who want personalized service and who will remain loyal for years.</p>
<p>The best travel agents make over ,000 a year. A select few earn over 0,000.</p>
<p>So your plan is a good one. Just remember to sell on value, not on price.</p>

Written between 1980 and 1995. Man from the south ends up in a crazy adventure in South America. Deals with meaning of life issues if I remember correctly. The type of book you pass on to someone else to read.<br />
It dealth with people chasing him. The dude found this cool jungle where all the people there were on this different level. They saw energy fields around things. There was some book or a final chapter of a book they were after or trying to get to somebody.</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by blahhh</i>: What is a good travel site offering tour packages to central and south America?</strong><br />
I had a link to a travel site catering to students, but have since lost it.  It seemed like the tours cost almost 1/2 as the others I&#8217;m pulling up from Google.  I just remember it had a simple gray background.</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by K yo</i><br/>Hi!<br />
If you google it you will find lots of big companies that do the same and offer almost the same prices, is not hard to find them&#8230;<br />
But in person opnion travel with them is a risk because they used to contact some one in area any got contract with them but they don&#8217;t really know the local team so you can have some trouble with that!<br />
I recommend to search for local agents of the destination you choose&#8230; is more safe and cheap, or find global portals that cares for destination like WHl.travel&#8230;<br />
I travelled to Rio by them, is a cool concept of travel, they are a local agency in each destination they have, in rio is http://www.riodejaneiro-hotels.travel/<br />
check them is good option i really recommend!<br />
hugs!</p>

<p>www.clymer.com 800-262-1954 Footage from the South America leg of Sjaak Lucassen on his 5 year adventure to travel around the world on an unlikely motorcycle a 2001 Yamaha R1. To make the motorcycle a serious adventure touring bike that could compete with well known motorcycles in the class including the BMW GS models and the Kawasaki KLR, the Yamaha R1 received extensive modifications including: adapted and strengthened sub frame to attach the top and two side trunks: placed an aluminum box in the space below the tank for a spare chain; placed a small rack on the steering stem to store the GPS; Van Wylick strengthened the aluminum stay fairing on both sides with 3 mm thick aluminum plates; joined the mirror supports underneath the fairing screen with a thick strip of aluminum to prevent vibration from breaking them; installed modified (5 cm shorter) Laser exhaust pipe so the exhaust wont blow against the spare Metzeler tires; installed a Cyclelok alarm with trunk protection; installed a Hyperpro steering damper; use fully synthetic Putoline oil; installed K&#038;N air filter; installed Osco chain oiler; installed Fuelstar between the fuel pipe so lower octane fuel can be used; placed a 12 volt adapter to charge the video camera and laptop batteries; installed an on/off switch between the supply of the right headlight to save current and still drive with one light on; installed a relay for the extra brake lights in the side trunks; and of course there was a Clymer shop service <b>&#8230;</b>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by sg4578</i>: I am planning to travel to South America in August. Does anyone want to plan this trip with me?</strong><br />
So far I am planning alone but am a little nervous about traveling all over S. America by  myself.  I am a college educated, 22 year old, male, white New Yorker.  I want to start in Bogota Colombia and travel south to Peru, <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a>, Chile and Argentina.  So far I have thought I would fly into Bogota and out of Buenos Aires four or so weeks later.  </p>
<p>Does a trip like this interest any other <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/american/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with american">American</a>?  </p>
<p>Does anyone have any tips to make this adventure safer and more fun? </p>
<p>I would rather have a travel companion to add to the safety of the trip, and also split costs like hotel rooms or car rentals. </p>
<p>Has anyone done something like this and have knowledge to share?  Even if you have specific information on one region in South America I would love to hear your input.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

<p><i>Answer by al</i><br/>Awesome dude!<br />
I would be so down for that except that I am in the middle of major projects for work&#8230;..I was supposed to go to Egypt for 2 weeks but had to kill those plans&#8230;</p>
<p>I been to Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brasil and Colombia in South America&#8230;.</p>
<p>Please be careful in my beautiful home country of Colombia&#8230;..I am glad you want to go there&#8230;&#8230;and I am sure you won&#8217;t leave disappointed but it potentially can be dangerous depending where you decide to go &#8230;especially if u plan to travel out of the country by land or boat&#8230;.</p>
<p>I suggest you fly out of Colombia&#8230;&#8230;If your plan is to go to Amazonian capital Leticia&#8230;.then take a boat to Iquitos in Peru&#8230;..not sure how safe it is but it may be a better option&#8230;..I would look into that&#8230;..(getting to Leticia is by plane only).</p>
<p>There will be parts of South America that are a bit shady&#8230;.but one thing South Americans are is very friendly&#8230;.</p>
<p>There are very obvious tourist attractions&#8230;.one of my favorites was on the boarder of Paraguay, Brasil and Argentina&#8230;.Waterfalls (Foz de Iguacu) and the Itapu Dam(largest in the world).</p>
<p>Ending your trip in Buenos Aires. is a good ending stop&#8230;.you can check out Uruguay&#8230;.(Colonia de Saramento or Montevideo) while you stay in BA. </p>
<p>There is a lot one can do in South America&#8230;..</p>
<p>Not sure about the order&#8230;&#8230;Colombia&#8230;..to Peru&#8230;..Chile&#8230;to Argentina and end in Brasil&#8230;.seems like the most logical order&#8230;..Unless you cross through Bolivia and Paraguay..to Brasil&#8230;.you can end your trip in Santiago, Chile..</p>
<p>Look into local &#8220;packaged&#8221; tickets from TAM, LAN or even TACA airlines and their associates and figure out how much it would cost you to but a x number of 1 way tickets to these locations&#8230;.(Like a Round the World Ticket)&#8230;but for just the immediate area&#8230;&#8230;They would normal allow you to fly with airlines within the same Alliance (Like One World and Star Alliance)&#8230;..give that into consideration because South America is big&#8230;.and 4 weeks seems like a short time to enjoy everything &#8230;&#8230;not rush&#8230;..Bad part about flying is the Airport Tax one needs to pay every time u fly internationally. </p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

How much money (australian dollars) i would need to stay for about a month in reasonable accomadation. I am looking at going in summer 2011 which i guess is ogign to be peak season. Any information would be helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by olivia</i><br/>I guess all countries have interesting places to visit.</p>
<p>You can go to Chile first, you may want to get to know Santiago, and maybe travel south.  You can take a bus to Argentina, and then get to Buenos Aires. Then you can cross to Colonia, Uruguay.  Then take a bus to Montevideo.  Then head to the beaches:  Punta del Este &#8211; fancy but expensive beach resort- and Rocha &#8211; laid back, younger people there.  You may also want to head to Brazilian beaches, such as Rio de Janeiro, Florianópolis.  You may also want to visit Iguazu Falls, and maybe Asuncion, although it&#8217;s supposed to be very hot in the summer. </p>
<p>These are some options.  You may also want to visit the Inca ruins in Peru.</p>
<p>I guess the cheapest accomodation would be staying at hostels, which is also a good way of meeting people.  Here&#8217;s the link:  http://www.hihostels.com/web/index.en.htm</p>

<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by peanutz</i><br/>Have you considered Thailand? There are great dives spots around Phuket in south of Thailand. You can also go island hoping around the area where there are national parks and trekking for waterfalls.</p>
<p>Then head out west to Tak. Umphang is an eco-delight, with great waterfalls of various sizes, jungle trekking and hilltribes visit. From there go north to Mae Hong Son for more hill tribles visit and jungle trekking, especially at Pai.</p>
<p>Then go visit ancient cities in Sukhothai, Buriram, Ayutthaya. See how early cultures were like in ancient Thailand.</p>
<p>And THailand has some ineteresting sights and fantastic shopping. Sounds good, you can contact me at tongbn@yahoo.co.uk for more details.</p>

          <div class="post-content"><p><strong><i>Question by Laura M</i>: Are the REI adventure tours in Patagonia worth the money?</strong><br />
I would like to go trekking in Patagonia (Chile and Argentina) next  year. I&#8217;ve never gone on an official tour (other than a few outings that lasted a few hours or half a day), but I enjoy traveling on my own. However, I question the safety of embarking on a jaunt like this by myself. I&#8217;m very fit and comfortable with <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/hiking/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with hiking">hiking</a> and camping but I don&#8217;t have any back-packing experience. So I&#8217;m thinking maybe a guided tour would be the right idea this time around.</p>
<p>Has anyone done any of the Patagonia adventure tours offered by REI? They&#8217;re ridiculously expensive, but I know it&#8217;s a good company and they have an excellent reputation.</p>
<p>Any feedback, suggestions, and particularly info from someone who&#8217;s taken one of the tours is much appreciated! My biggest hang-up is definitely the price. I usually travel on-the-cheap.</p>

<p><i>Answer by Deep <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/brazil/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Brazil">Brazil</a></i><br/>I would definitely go. I have been to Rio at least 10 times (I was born in São Paulo), it is such a fascinating city. Of course, it depends on what are your favorite activities. If you like small towns, maybe it is not for you.<br />
It has phenomenal beaches, good food and night life, beautiful national and state parks, a few good museums.  You should definitely visit the Botanical Gardens and Confeitaria Colombo, a 19th century café.<br />

We were along Main Street and saw this magical display above Sleeping Beauty&#8217;s winter castle. When the firework show was over, we went right by the castle. It was sparkly and magical! Then we decided to go see how the &#8220;it&#8217;s a small world&#8221; ride looked like. It was so colorful and filled with brilliant lights! It was then nearing midnight so we decided to call it a night of December 29. The next day, of December 30, it was not a nice day to go out. It was gloomy and showery outside&#8230;Nonetheless we still enjoyed our (first time) visit to California Adventures. We went to the &#8220;It&#8217;s tough to be a bug&#8221; and to the Hollywood Pictures Backlot. Then later that evening, we decided to visit Disneyland again. We rode the Disneyland railroad, Startours and ate dinner at the Redd Rockett&#8217;s Pizza Port in Tomorrowland. Then after dinner, we went to the &#8220;It&#8217;s a small world&#8221; <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a>.

<p>Watch in HQ. In this video, it shows our <a href="http://holidays.bz/tag/holiday/" class="st_tag internal_tag" rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with Holiday">holiday</a> trip to Disneyland in Anaheim, CA! It&#8217;s been a decade since I&#8217;ve been to Disneyland. So in this video, it shows our long road trip to LA It was a long 6+ hour drive. Enjoy the scenery! Then once we arrived to Anaheim, we went straight for our condominium at Dolphins&#8217; Cove. It was nice! We also had a good dinner. Then the next morning of December 29, we finally went to Disneyland. Boy there were a lot of people already that early (at around 7:30a.m.). There was a huge Christmas tree on Main Street. We then ate breakfast at Carnation Cafe. After the breakfast, we went to the Enchanted Tiki Room in Adventureland. Hope you enjoy the video! Our fun at Disneyland continues on video Part 2.

<p>In January 2009 I set out to bicycle from Paraguay to the United States to support conservation efforts in the San Rafael Reserve, the last 7% of Paraguay&#8217;s Atlantic Forest. This is the adventure that ensued. If you like this video or support forest conservation please share the video. The more views the video gets the more support Paraguay gets. Si le gusta este video o apoya a la conservacion de los bosques, por favor comparta el video.

I like planning my own holidays instead of being ripped off by travel agents plus i dont like being rounded up and shuffled around by tour companies on package tours&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway,<br />
I want to visit the galapagos islands for only a couple of days and would like to know what the best plan would be&#8230;</p>
<p>Do i fly to Equador and book hotel there (if yes then where is best?)</p>
<p>Once in Equador, are there any arranged trips to the islands that i can book locally?</p>
<p>I really want to see the Galapagos Islands but without the package element and i only wish to spend a total of a week for the whole break&#8230;.</p>
<p>Your help is greatly received.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Ant</p>
<p><strong>Best answer:</strong></p>
<p><i>Answer by QueenBlack</i><br/>I expect you can fly there, find a hotel and a travel group for the island trip. You may want to reserve the island trip before you go as only a certain number get to go, although you may find cancellations at the last minute. It is a shame to go all that way for only a week. I went for 3 weeks and hopped aroung central and south america.</p>

<p><i>Answer by fashonion</i><br/>This site lists a number of tour operators in South America http://www.tourvacationstogo.com/south_america_tours.cfm</p>
<p>You could also visit STA travel as they are aimed at the youth market. http://www.statravel.co.uk/cps/rde/xchg/uk_division_web_live/hs.xsl/toursandtreks-southamerica.htm</p>
