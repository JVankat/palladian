                            <p> Hayman uses the 457 visa program, and has for a number of years to bring in skilled and qualified people to fill positions we have been unable to fill locally. The wages and conditions of employment are identical to the conditions offered to our locally employed staff. For example there are a number of chefs we have sponsored from around the world. A Sous Chef on a 457 visa receives exactly the same remuneration and benefits as any other Sous Chef employed by Hayman. </p>
                            <p> The reason for using the 457 visa and asking for further support in relation to international recruitment is in response to the decline in qualified and experienced hospitality professionals seeking jobs in regional areas. It is well known that Australia is experiencing the lowest unemployment in 30 years, which means that Hayman, along with most other regional organisations is experiencing difficulties in filling vacancies. The continued deterioration of standards of quality and service and the potential for a downturn in visitor arrivals into the region will not only adversely impact the Resort sector, but a number of small / medium businesses providing daily support services from the mainland towns like Airlie Beach, Proserpine and Mackay.
