Below the lithosphere lies the <a href="/e/a/as/asthenosphere.htm">asthenosphere</a> which comprises the inner viscous part of the mantle. The mantle behaves like a superheated and extremely viscous liquid.<br><br>The lithosphere essentially <i>floats</i> on the asthenosphere. The lithosphere is broken up into what are called <i>tectonic plates</i> - in the case of Earth, there are ten major and many minor plates. These plates move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: <a href="/e/c/co/convergent_boundary.htm">convergent</a>, <a href="/e/d/di/divergent_boundary.htm">divergent</a>, and <a href="/e/t/tr/transform_fault.htm">transform</a>. <a href="/e/e/ea/earthquake.htm">Earthquake</a>s, <a href="/e/v/vo/volcano.htm">volcanic activity</a>, <a href="/e/m/mo/mountain.htm">mountain</a>-building, and <a href="/e/o/oc/oceanic_trench.htm">oceanic trench</a> formation occur along plate boundaries.<h2 class="wk"><a name="hd1">Development</a></h2>Plate tectonic theory is currently the theory accepted by the vast majority of scientists working in this area.

The theory itself was developed during the late 1960s and has since been universally accepted by virtually all scientists. It has revolutionized the <a href="/e/e/ea/earth_science.htm">earth science</a>s and, because of its unifying and explanatory power for diverse geological phenomena, can be compared to other successful theories such as the <a href="/e/p/pe/periodic_table.htm">periodic table</a> in <a href="/e/c/ch/chemistry.htm">chemistry</a>, the <a href="/e/g/ge/genetic_code.htm">genetic code</a> in <a href="/e/b/bi/biology.htm">biology</a>, and <a href="/e/q/qu/quantum_mechanics.htm">quantum mechanics</a> in <a href="/e/p/ph/physics.htm">physics</a>.<table bgcolor="cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" class="imgR"><tr><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td class="wkTC" width="260"><p>The tectonic plates of the world were mapped in the second half of the 20th century.

The lithosphere is cooler and more rigid, whilst the asthenosphere is hotter and mechanically weaker. This division should not be confused with the <i>chemical</i> subdivision of the Earth into (from innermost to outermost) <a href="/e/e/ea/earth#the_core.htm">core</a>, <a href="/e/m/ma/mantle_(geology).htm">mantle</a>, and <a href="/e/c/cr/crust_(geology).htm">crust</a>. The key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct <i><a href="/e/t/te/tectonic_plate.htm">tectonic plate</a>s</i>, which float on the fluid-like (visco-elastic liquid) asthenosphere. The relative fluidity of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to undergo motion in different directions. <br><br>The plates are around 100 km (60 miles) thick and consist of two principal types of material: oceanic crust (also called <i><a href="/e/s/si/sima_(geology).htm">sima</a></i> from <a href="/e/s/si/silicon.htm">silicon</a> and <a href="/e/m/ma/magnesium.htm">magnesium</a>) and continental crust (<i><a href="/e/s/si/sial.htm">sial</a></i> from silicon and <a href="/e/a/al/aluminium.htm">aluminium</a>). The two types of crust also differ in thickness, with continental crust considerably thicker than oceanic.<br><br>One plate meets another along a <i>plate boundary</i>, and plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as <a href="/e/e/ea/earthquake.htm">earthquake</a>s and the creation of topographic features like <a href="/e/m/mo/mountain.htm">mountain</a>s, <a href="/e/v/vo/volcano.htm">volcano</a>es and <a href="/e/o/oc/oceanic_trench.htm">oceanic trench</a>es. The majority of the world's active volcanoes occur along plate boundaries, with the Pacific Plate's <a href="/e/p/pa/pacific_ring_of_fire.htm">Ring of Fire</a> being most active and famous. These boundaries are discussed in further detail below.<br><br>Tectonic plates can include <a href="/e/c/co/continental_crust.htm">continental crust</a> or <a href="/e/o/oc/oceanic_crust.htm">oceanic crust</a>, and typically, a single plate carries both. For example, the <a href="/e/a/af/african_plate.htm">African Plate</a> includes the continent and parts of the floor of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The distinction between continental crust and oceanic crust is based on the density of constituent materials; oceanic crust is denser than continental crust owing to their different proportions of various elements, particularly, silicon. Oceanic crust has less silicon and more heavier elements ("<a href="/e/m/ma/mafic.htm">mafic</a>") than continental crust ("<a href="/e/f/fe/felsic.htm">felsic</a>").<br><br>As a result, oceanic crust generally lies below sea level (for example most of the <a href="/e/p/pa/pacific_plate.htm">Pacific Plate</a>), while the continental crust projects above sea level (see <a href="/e/i/is/isostasy.htm">isostasy</a> for explanation of this principle).<h2 class="wk"><a name="hd3">Types of plate boundaries</a></h2><table bgcolor="cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" class="imgR"><tr><td align="center"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tectonic_plate_boundaries.png"><img src="http://z.about.com/f/wiki/e/en/thumb/4/40/Tectonic_plate_boundaries.png/350px-Tectonic_plate_boundaries.png" class="imgW" border="0" alt="Tectonic_plate_boundaries.png" onError="this.src='http://z.about.com'" onLoad="rsz(this)")></a></td></tr><tr><td class="wkTC" width="350"><p>Three types of plate boundary.</p></td></tr></table>There are three types of plate boundaries, characterized by the way the plates move relative to each other. They are associated with different types of surface phenomena. The different types of plate boundaries are:# <b><a href="/e/0/#transform_(conservative)_boundaries.htm">Transform boundaries</a></b> occur where plates slide, or perhaps more accurately grind, past each other along <a href="/e/t/tr/transform_fault.htm">transform fault</a>s.

The origin of new divergent boundaries at <a href="/e/t/tr/triple_junction.htm">triple junction</a>s is sometimes thought to be associated with the phenomenon known as <a href="/e/h/ho/hotspot_(geology).htm">hotspots</a>. Here, exceedingly large convective cells bring very large quantities of hot asthenospheric material near the surface and the <a href="/e/k/ki/kinetic_energy.htm">kinetic energy</a> is thought to be sufficient to break apart the lithosphere. The hot spot which may have initiated the Mid-Atlantic Ridge system currently underlies <a href="/e/i/ic/iceland.htm">Iceland</a> which is widening at a rate of a few centimeters per century. <br><br>Divergent boundaries are typified in the oceanic lithosphere by the rifts of the <a href="/e/m/mi/mid-ocean_ridge.htm">oceanic ridge</a> system, including the <a href="/e/m/mi/mid-atlantic_ridge.htm">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a> and the <a href="/e/e/ea/east_pacific_rise.htm">East Pacific Rise</a>, and in the continental lithosphere by rift valleys such as the famous <a href="/e/g/gr/great_rift_valley.htm">East African Great Rift Valley</a>. Divergent boundaries can create massive fault zones in the oceanic ridge system. Spreading is generally not uniform, so where spreading rates of adjacent ridge blocks are different massive <a href="/e/t/tr/transform_fault.htm">transform fault</a>s occur. These are the <a href="/e/f/fr/fracture_zone.htm">fracture zone</a>s, many bearing names, that are a major source of submarine earthquakes. A sea floor map will show a rather strange pattern of blocky structures that are separated by <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/publications/text/baseball.html">linear features</a> perpendicular to the ridge axis. If one views the sea floor between the fracture zones as conveyor belts carrying the ridge on each side of the rift away from the spreading center the action becomes clear. Crest depths of the old ridges, parallel to the current spreading center, will be older and deeper (due to thermal contraction and <a href="/e/s/su/subsidence.htm">subsidence</a>).<br><br>It is at mid-ocean ridges that one of the key pieces of evidence forcing acceptance of the sea-floor spreading hypothesis was found. Airborne <a href="/e/e/ea/earth's_magnetic_field.htm">geomagnetic</a> surveys showed a strange pattern of symmetrical <a href="/e/m/ma/magnetic_reversal.htm">magnetic reversal</a>s on opposite sides of ridge centres. The pattern was far too regular to be coincidental as the widths of the opposing bands were too closely matched. Scientists had been studying polar reversals and the link was made. The magnetic banding directly corresponds with the Earth's polar reversals. This was confirmed by measuring the ages of the rocks within each band. The banding furnishes a map in time and space of both spreading rate and polar reversals.<h3 class="wk">Convergent (destructive) boundaries</h3>The nature of a convergent boundary depends on the type of lithosphere in the plates that are colliding. Where a dense oceanic plate collides with a less-dense continental plate, the oceanic plate is typically thrust underneath due to the greater buoyancy of the continental lithosphere, forming a <a href="/e/s/su/subduction_zone.htm">subduction zone</a>. At the surface, the topographic expression is commonly an <a href="/e/o/oc/oceanic_trench.htm">oceanic trench</a> on the ocean side and a mountain range on the continental side.  An example of a continental-oceanic subduction zone is the area along the western coast of <a href="/e/s/so/south_america.htm">South America</a> where the oceanic <a href="/e/n/na/nazca_plate.htm">Nazca Plate</a> is being subducted beneath the continental <a href="/e/s/so/south_american_plate.htm">South American Plate</a>. While the processes directly associated with the production of melts directly above downgoing plates producing surface volcanism is the subject of some debate in the geologic community, the general consensus from ongoing research suggests that the release of volatiles is the primary contributor.  As the subducting plate descends, its temperature rises driving off volatiles (most importantly water) encased in the porous oceanic crust. As this water rises into the mantle of the overriding plate, it lowers the melting temperature of surrounding mantle, producing melts (<a href="/e/m/ma/magma.htm">magma</a>) with large amounts of dissolved gases. These melts rise to the surface and are the source of some of the most explosive volcanism on earth due to their high volumes of extremely pressurized gases (consider <a href="/e/m/mo/mount_st._helens.htm">Mount St. Helens</a>).  The melts rise to the surface and cool forming long chains of <a href="/e/v/vo/volcano.htm">volcanoes</a> inland from the continental shelf and parallel to it. The continental spine of western <a href="/e/s/so/south_america.htm">South America</a> is dense with this type of volcanic <a href="/e/o/or/orogeny.htm">mountain building</a> from the subduction of the <a href="/e/n/na/nazca_plate.htm">Nazca plate</a>. In <a href="/e/n/no/north_america.htm">North America</a> the <a href="/e/c/ca/cascade_range.htm">Cascade mountain range</a>, extending north from California's Sierra Nevada, is also of this type. Such volcanoes are characterized by alternating periods of quiet and episodic eruptions that start with explosive gas expulsion with fine particles of glassy volcanic ash and spongy <a href="/e/c/ci/cinders.htm">cinders</a>, followed by a rebuilding phase with hot magma. The entire Pacific Ocean boundary is surrounded by long stretches of volcanoes and is known collectively as <i>The Ring of Fire</i>.<br><br>Where two continental plates collide the plates either buckle and compress or one plate delves under or (in some cases) overrides the other. Either action will create extensive mountain ranges. The most dramatic effect seen is where the northern margin of the Indian Plate is being thrust under a portion of the Eurasian plate, lifting it and creating the <a href="/e/h/hi/himalaya.htm">Himalaya</a>s and the <a href="/e/t/ti/tibetan_plateau.htm">Tibetan Plateau</a> beyond. It has also caused parts of the Asian continent to deform westward and eastward on either side of the collision.<br><br>When two plates with oceanic crust converge they typically create an <a href="/e/i/is/island_arc.htm">island arc</a> as one plate is <a href="/e/s/su/subducted.htm">subducted</a> below the other. The arc is formed from volcanoes which erupt through the overriding plate as the descending plate melts below it. The arc shape occurs because of the spherical surface of the earth (nick the peel of an orange with a knife and note the arc formed by the straight-edge of the knife). A deep undersea trench is located in front of such arcs where the descending slab dips downward. Good examples of this type of plate convergence would be <a href="/e/j/ja/japan.htm">Japan</a> and the <a href="/e/a/al/aleutian_islands.htm">Aleutian Islands</a> in Alaska.<table align="center"><td><table bgcolor="cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" class="imgR"><tr><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td class="wkTC" width="260"><p>Oceanic / Continental</p></td></tr></table><td><table bgcolor="cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" class="imgR"><tr><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td class="wkTC" width="180"><p>Continental / Continental</p></td></tr></table><td><table bgcolor="cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" class="imgR"><tr><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td class="wkTC" width="180"><p>Oceanic / Oceanic</p></td></tr></table></table>Plates may collide at an oblique angle rather than head-on (e.g. one plate moving north, the other moving south-east), and this may cause <a href="/e/g/ge/geologic_fault#strike-slip_faults.htm">strike-slip faulting</a> along the collision zone, in addition to subduction.<br><br>Not all plate boundaries are easily defined. Some are broad belts whose movements are unclear to scientists. One example would be the Mediterranean-Alpine boundary, which involves two major plates and several micro plates. The boundaries of the plates do not necessarily coincide with those of the continents. For instance, the North American Plate covers not only North America, but also far eastern Siberia and northern Japan.<h2 class="wk"><a name="hd4">Driving forces of plate motion</a></h2>As noted above, the plates are able to move because of the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of energy driving plate tectonics. <br><br>Two and three-dimensional imaging of the Earth's interior (<a href="/e/s/se/seismic_tomography.htm">seismic tomography</a>), shows that there is a laterally heterogenous density distribution throughout the mantle.  Such density variations can be material (from rock chemistry), mineral (from variations in mineral structures), or thermal (through thermal expansion and contraction from heat energy).  The manifestation of this lateral density heterogeny is mantle convection due to buoyancy forces.<a href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/23/12409">Tanimoto 2000</a>. How mantle convection relates directly and indirectly to the motion of the plates is a matter of ongoing study and discussion in geodynamics. Somehow, this <a href="/e/e/en/energy.htm">energy</a> must be transferred to the lithosphere in order for tectonic plates to move. There are essentially two types of forces that are thought to influence plate motion: <a href="/e/f/fr/friction.htm">friction</a> and <a href="/e/g/gr/gravity.htm">gravity</a>.<h3 class="wk">Frictional torques</h3>;Basal drag : Large scale <a href="/e/c/co/convection.htm">convection</a> currents in the upper mantle are transmitted through the asthenosphere; motion is driven by friction between the asthenosphere and the lithosphere.<b>Slab suction : Local convection currents exert a downward frictional pull on plates in subduction zones at ocean trenches.  Although, one could in effect argue that Slab-suction is actually merely a unique geodynamic setting wherein which basal tractions continue to act on the plate as it dives into the mantle (although perhaps to a greater extent -- acting on both the under and upper side of the slab).</b><h3 class="wk">Gravitational torques</h3>;Gravitational sliding : Plate motion is driven by the higher elevation of plates at ocean ridges. As oceanic lithosphere is formed at spreading ridges from hot mantle material it gradually cools and thickens with age (and thus distance from the ridge).  Cool oceanic lithosphere is significantly denser than the hot mantle material from which it is derived and so with increasing thickness it gradually subsides into the mantle to compensate the greater load.  The result is a slight lateral incline with distance from the ridge axis.<br><br>Casually in the geophysical community and more typically in the geological literature in lower education this process is often referred to as "ridge-push".  This is, in fact, a misnomer as nothing is "pushing" and tensional features are dominant along ridges.  It is more accurate to refer to this torque mechanism as gravitational sliding as variable topography across the totality of the plate can vary considerably and the topography of spreading ridges is only the most prominent feature.  For example::1. Flexural buldging of the lithosphere before it dives underneath an adjacent plate, for instance, produces a clear topographical feature that can offset or at least effect the influence of topographical ocean ridges.:2. <a href="/e/m/ma/mantle_plume.htm">Mantle plume</a>s impinging on the underside of tectonic plates can drastically alter the topography of the ocean floor.<br><br>;Slab-pull : Plate motion is driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at trenches. There is considerable evidence that convection is occurring in the mantle at some scale. The upwelling of material at mid-ocean ridges is almost certainly part of this convection. Some early models of plate tectonics envisioned the plates riding on top of convection cells like conveyor belts. However, most scientists working today believe that the asthenosphere is not strong enough to directly cause motion by the friction of such basal torques. Slab pull is most widely thought to be the greatest torque force acting on the plates.<h3 class="wk">External forces</h3>;Lunar tidal drag : In a study published in the January-February 2006 issue of the Geological Society of America Bulletin, a team of Italian and U.S. scientists argue that the westward component of plates is due to Earth's rotation and consequent tidal friction of the moon. As the Earth spins eastward beneath the moon, they say, the moon's gravity ever so slightly pulls the Earth's surface layer back westward. It has also been suggested (albeit, controvertially) that this observation may also explain why Venus and Mars have no plate tectonics since Venus has no moon, and Mars' moons are too small to have significant tidal effects on Mars. [<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0124_060124_moon.html">1</a>] This is not a new argument, however. It was originally raised by the "father" of the plate tectonics hypothesis, <a href="/e/a/al/alfred_wegener.htm">Alfred Wegener</a>. It was challenged by the physicist <a href="/e/h/ha/harold_jeffreys.htm">Harold Jeffreys</a> who calculated that the magnitude of tidal friction required would have quickly brought the Earth's rotation to a halt long ago. One might note that many plates are moving north and eastward (not west), and that the dominantly westward motion of the the Pacific ocean basins is simply due to the eastward bias of the Pacific spreading center (which is not a predicted manifestation of such lunar torques).  It is argued, however, that relative to the lower mantle, there is a slight westward component in the motions of all the plates.<h3 class="wk">Relative significance of each torque mechanism</h3><table bgcolor="cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" class="imgR"><tr><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td class="wkTC" width="350"><p>Plate motion based on Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite data from NASA <a href="http://sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov/mbh/series.html">JPL</a>. Vectors show direction and magnitude of motion.</p></td></tr></table>Because of basic physical laws, all of these forces must be acting on the plates.  However, therein remains the question of to what degree of influence each process contributes to the motion of the plates.  One method of dealing with this problem is to consider the relative rate at which each plate is moving, since the diversity of geodynamic settings and properties of each plate must clearly result in differences in the degree to which such processes are actively driving the plates.For this reason geoscientists have characterized such differences of the plates in an attempt to find correlations in relative plate velocity -- and such correlations are found, indeed.  One of the most significant correlations found is that lithospheric plates attached to downgoing (subducting) plates move much faster than plates not attached to subducting plates.  The pacific plate, for instance, is essentially surrounded by zones of subduction (the so-called <a href="/e/p/pa/pacific_ring_of_fire.htm">Pacific Ring of Fire</a>) and moves much faster than the plates of the Atlantic basin, which are attached (perhaps one could say 'welded') to adjacent continents instead of subducting plates.  It is thus thought that forces associated with the downgoing plate (slab pull and slab suction) are the big players that determine the motion of plates.The driving forces of plate motion are, nevertheless, still very active subjects of on-going discussion and research in the geophysical community.<h2 class="wk"><a name="hd5">Major plates</a></h2>The main plates are<br>*<a href="/e/a/af/african_plate.htm">African Plate</a>, covering <a href="/e/a/af/africa.htm">Africa</a> - Continental plate<br>*<a href="/e/a/an/antarctic_plate.htm">Antarctic Plate</a>, covering <a href="/e/a/an/antarctica.htm">Antarctica</a> - Continental plate<br>*<a href="/e/a/au/australian_plate.htm">Australian Plate</a>, covering <a href="/e/a/au/australia.htm">Australia</a> (fused with <a href="/e/i/in/indian_plate.htm">Indian Plate</a> between 50 and 55 million years ago) - Continental plate<br>*<a href="/e/e/eu/eurasian_plate.htm">Eurasian Plate</a> covering <a href="/e/a/as/asia.htm">Asia</a> - Continental plate<br>*<a href="/e/n/no/north_american_plate.htm">North American Plate</a> covering <a href="/e/n/no/north_america.htm">North America</a> and north-east <a href="/e/s/si/siberia.htm">Siberia</a> - Continental plate<br>*<a href="/e/s/so/south_american_plate.htm">South American Plate</a> covering <a href="/e/s/so/south_america.htm">South America</a> - Continental plate<br>*<a href="/e/p/pa/pacific_plate.htm">Pacific Plate</a>, covering the <a href="/e/p/pa/pacific_ocean.htm">Pacific Ocean</a> - Oceanic plate<br><br>Notable minor plates include the <a href="/e/i/in/indian_plate.htm">Indian Plate</a>, the <a href="/e/a/ar/arabian_plate.htm">Arabian Plate</a>, the <a href="/e/c/ca/caribbean_plate.htm">Caribbean Plate</a>, and the <a href="/e/s/sc/scotia_plate.htm">Scotia Plate</a>.<br><br>The movement of plates has caused the formation and breakup of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents.The supercontinent <a href="/e/r/ro/rodinia.htm">Rodinia</a> is thought to have formed about 1000 million years agoand to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents, and broken up into eight continents around 600 million years ago.

The theory has been superseded by and the concepts and data have been incorporated within plate tectonics.<br><br>By 1915 <a href="/e/a/al/alfred_wegener.htm">Alfred Wegener</a> was making serious arguments for the idea with the first edition of <i>The Origin of Continents and Oceans</i>. In that book he noted how the east coast of <a href="/e/s/so/south_america.htm">South America</a> and the west coast of <a href="/e/a/af/africa.htm">Africa</a> looked as if they were once attached. Wegener wasn't the first to note this (<a href="/e/f/fr/francis_bacon.htm">Francis Bacon</a>, <a href="/e/b/be/benjamin_franklin.htm">Benjamin Franklin</a> and <a href="/e/s/sn/snider-pellegrini.htm">Snider-Pellegrini</a> preceded him), but he was the first to marshal significant <a href="/e/f/fo/fossil.htm">fossil</a> and paleo-topographical and climatological evidence to support this simple observation. However, his ideas were not taken seriously by many geologists, who pointed out that there was no apparent mechanism for continental drift. Specifically they did not see how continental rock could plow through the much denser rock that makes up oceanic crust. <br><br>Wegener's vindication did not come until after his death in 1930.  In 1947, a team of scientists led by <a href="/e/m/ma/maurice_ewing.htm">Maurice Ewing</a> utilizing the <a href="/e/w/wo/woods_hole_oceanographic_institution.htm">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a>'s research vessel <i>Atlantis</i> and an array of instruments, confirmed the existence of a rise in the central Atlantic Ocean, and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the layer of sediments consisted of basalt, not granite which was common on the continents. They also found that the oceanic crust was much thinner than continental crust. All these new findings raised important and intriguing questions. [<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Winter2001/ewing.html">2</a>]<br><br>Beginning in the 1950s, scientists including Harry Hess, using magnetic instruments (<a href="/e/m/ma/magnetometer.htm">magnetometer</a>s) adapted from airborne devices developed during <a href="/e/w/wo/world_war_ii.htm">World War II</a> to detect <a href="/e/s/su/submarine.htm">submarine</a>s, began recognizing odd magnetic variations across the ocean floor. This finding, though unexpected, was not entirely surprising because it was known that <a href="/e/b/ba/basalt.htm">basalt</a>  contains a strongly magnetic mineral (<a href="/e/m/ma/magnetite.htm">magnetite</a>) and can locally distort compass readings. This distortion was recognized by <a href="/e/i/ic/iceland.htm">Iceland</a>ic mariners as early as the late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these newly discovered magnetic variations provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials recorded the <a href="/e/e/ea/earth's_magnetic_field.htm">Earth's magnetic field</a> at the time.<br><br>As more and more of the seafloor was mapped during the 1950s, the magnetic variations turned out not to be random or isolated occurrences, but instead revealed recognizable patterns. When these magnetic patterns were mapped over a wide region, the ocean floor showed a zebra-like pattern. Alternating stripes of magnetically different rock were laid out in rows on either side of the mid-ocean ridge: one stripe with normal polarity and the adjoining stripe with reversed polarity. The overall pattern, defined by these alternating bands of normally and reversely polarized rock, became known as magnetic striping.<br><br>When the rock <a href="/e/s/st/stratum.htm">strata</a> of the tips of separate continents are very similar it suggests that these rocks were formed in the same way implying that they were joined initially. For instance, some parts of <a href="/e/s/sc/scotland.htm">Scotland</a> and <a href="/e/i/ir/ireland.htm">Ireland</a> contain rocks very similar to those found in <a href="/e/n/ne/newfoundland.htm">Newfoundland</a> and <a href="/e/n/ne/new_brunswick.htm">New Brunswick</a>. Furthermore, the <a href="/e/c/ca/caledonian_mountains.htm">Caledonian Mountains</a> of Europe and parts of the <a href="/e/a/ap/appalachian_mountains.htm">Appalachian Mountains</a> of North America are very similar in <a href="/e/s/st/structural_geology.htm">structure</a> and <a href="/e/l/li/lithology.htm">lithology</a>.<h3 class="wk">Floating continents</h3>The prevailing concept was that there were static shells of strata under the continents.

The most notable was the 1962 publication of a paper by American geologist <a href="/e/h/ha/harry_hess.htm">Harry Hess</a> (<a href="/e/r/ro/robert_s._dietz.htm">Robert S. Dietz</a> published the same idea one year earlier in <i>Nature</i>. However, priority belongs to Hess, since he distributed an unpublished manuscript of his 1962 article already in 1960). Hess suggested that instead of continents moving <i>through</i> oceanic crust (as was suggested by continental drift) that an ocean basin and its adjoining continent moved together on the same crustal unit, or plate. In the same year, <a href="/e/r/ro/robert_r._coats.htm">Robert R. Coats</a> of the U.S. Geological Survey described the main features of island arc subduction in the Aleutian Islands. His paper, though little-noted (and even ridiculed) at the time, has since been called "seminal" and "prescient". In <a href="/e/0/1967.htm">1967</a>, <a href="/e/w/w/w._jason_morgan.htm">W. Jason Morgan</a> proposed that the Earth's surface consists of 12 rigid plates that move relative to each other. Two months later, in 1968, <a href="/e/x/xa/xavier_le_pichon.htm">Xavier Le Pichon</a> published a complete model based on 6 major plates with their relative motions.<h4 class="wk">Explanation of magnetic striping</h4><table bgcolor="cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" class="imgR"><tr><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td class="wkTC" width="180"><p>Seafloor magnetic striping.</p></td></tr></table>The discovery of magnetic striping and the stripes being symmetrical around the crests of the mid-ocean ridges suggested a relationship. In 1961, scientists began to theorise that mid-ocean ridges mark structurally weak zones where the ocean floor was being ripped in two lengthwise along the ridge crest. New <a href="/e/m/ma/magma.htm">magma</a> from deep within the Earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually erupts along the crest of the ridges to create new <a href="/e/o/oc/oceanic_crust.htm">oceanic crust</a>. This process, later called seafloor spreading, operating over many millions of years continues to form new ocean floor all accross the 50,000 km-long system of mid-ocean ridges. This hypothesis was supported by several lines of evidence:# at or near the crest of the ridge, the rocks are very young, and they become progressively older away from the ridge crest;# the youngest rocks at the ridge crest always have present-day (normal) polarity;# stripes of rock parallel to the ridge crest alternated in magnetic polarity (normal-reversed-normal, etc.), suggesting that the Earth's magnetic field has flip-flopped many times. By explaining both the zebralike magnetic striping and the construction of the mid-ocean ridge system, the seafloor spreading hypothesis quickly gained converts and represented another major advance in the development of the plate-tectonics theory. Furthermore, the oceanic crust now came to be appreciated as a natural "tape recording" of the history of the reversals in the <a href="/e/e/ea/earth's_magnetic_field.htm">Earth's magnetic field</a>.<h4 class="wk">Subduction discovered</h4>A profound consequence of seafloor spreading is that new crust was, and is now, being continually created along the oceanic ridges. This idea found great favor with some scientists who claimed that the shifting of the continents can be simply explained by a large increase in size of the Earth since its formation. However, this so-called "<a href="/e/e/ex/expanded_earth_theory.htm">Expanded earth theory</a>" hypothesis was unsatisfactory because its supporters could offer no convincing geologic mechanism to produce such a huge, sudden expansion. Most geologists believe that the Earth has changed little, if at all, in size since its formation 4.6 billion years ago, raising a key question: how can new crust be continuously added along the oceanic ridges without increasing the size of the Earth?<br><br>This question particularly intrigued <a href="/e/h/ha/harry_hess.htm">Harry Hess</a>, a <a href="/e/p/pr/princeton_university.htm">Princeton University</a> geologist and a Naval Reserve Rear Admiral, and <a href="/e/r/ro/robert_s._dietz.htm">Robert S. Dietz</a>, a scientist with the <a href="/e/u/u/u.s._coast_and_geodetic_survey.htm">U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey</a> who first coined the term <i>seafloor spreading</i>. Dietz and Hess were among the small handful who really understood the broad implications of sea floor spreading. If the Earth's crust was expanding along the oceanic ridges, Hess reasoned, it must be shrinking elsewhere. He suggested that new oceanic crust continuously spread away from the ridges in a conveyor belt-like motion. Many millions of years later, the oceanic crust eventually descends into the <a href="/e/o/oc/oceanic_trench.htm">oceanic trench</a>es -- very deep, narrow canyons along the rim of the Pacific Ocean basin. According to Hess, the Atlantic Ocean was expanding while the Pacific Ocean was shrinking. As old oceanic crust was consumed in the trenches, new magma rose and erupted along the spreading ridges to form new crust. In effect, the ocean basins were perpetually being "recycled," with the creation of new crust and the destruction of old oceanic lithosphere occurring simultaneously. Thus, Hess' ideas neatly explained why the Earth does not get bigger with sea floor spreading, why there is so little sediment accumulation on the ocean floor, and why oceanic rocks are much younger than continental rocks.<h4 class="wk">Mapping with earthquakes</h4>During the 20th century, improvements in and greater use of seismic instruments such as <a href="/e/s/se/seismograph.htm">seismograph</a>s enabled scientists to learn that <a href="/e/e/ea/earthquake.htm">earthquake</a>s tend to be concentrated in certain areas, most notably along the oceanic trenches and spreading ridges. By the late 1920s, seismologists were beginning to identify several prominent earthquake zones parallel to the trenches that typically were inclined 40-60° from the horizontal and extended several hundred kilometers into the Earth. These zones later became known as <a href="/e/w/wa/wadati-benioff_zone.htm">Wadati-Benioff zone</a>s, or simply <a href="/e/b/be/benioff_zone.htm">Benioff zone</a>s, in honor of the seismologists who first recognized them, <a href="/e/k/ki/kiyoo_wadati.htm">Kiyoo Wadati</a> of <a href="/e/j/ja/japan.htm">Japan</a> and <a href="/e/h/hu/hugo_benioff.htm">Hugo Benioff</a> of the <a href="/e/u/un/united_states.htm">United States</a>. The study of global seismicity greatly advanced in the 1960s with the establishment of the <a href="/e/w/wo/worldwide_standardized_seismograph_network.htm">Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network</a> (WWSSN) to monitor the compliance of the 1963 treaty banning above-ground testing of nuclear weapons. The much-improved data from the WWSSN instruments allowed seismologists to map precisely the zones of earthquake concentration worldwide.<h3 class="wk">Geological paradigm shift</h3>The acceptance of the theories of continental drift and sea floor spreading (the two key elements of plate tectonics) can be compared to the Copernican revolution in <a href="/e/a/as/astronomy.htm">astronomy</a> (see <a href="/e/n/ni/nicolaus_copernicus.htm">Nicolaus Copernicus</a>). Within a matter of only several years <a href="/e/g/ge/geophysics.htm">geophysics</a> and geology in particular were revolutionized. The parallel is striking: just as pre-Copernican astronomy was highly descriptive but still unable to provide explanations for the motions of celestial objects, pre-tectonic plate geological theories described what was observed but struggled to provide any fundamental mechanisms. The problem lay in the question "How?". Before acceptance of plate tectonics, geology in particular was trapped in a "pre-Copernican" box. <br><br>However, by comparison to astronomy the geological revolution was much more sudden. What had been rejected for decades by any respectable <a href="/e/s/sc/scientific_journal.htm">scientific journal</a> was eagerly accepted within a few short years in the 1960s and 1970s. Any geological description before this had been highly descriptive. All the rocks were described and assorted reasons, sometimes in excruciating detail, were given for why they were where they are. The descriptions are still valid. The reasons, however, today sound much like pre-Copernican astronomy. <br><br>One simply has to read the pre-plate descriptions of why the <a href="/e/a/al/alps.htm">Alps</a> or <a href="/e/h/hi/himalaya.htm">Himalaya</a> exist to see the difference. In an attempt to answer "how" questions like "How can rocks that are clearly marine in origin exist thousands of meters above sea-level in the <a href="/e/d/do/dolomites.htm">Dolomites</a>?", or "How did the convex and concave margins of the Alpine chain form?", any true insight was hidden by complexity that boiled down to technical jargon without much fundamental insight as to the underlying mechanics.<br><br>With plate tectonics answers quickly fell into place or a path to the answer became clear. Collisions of converging plates had the force to lift sea floor into thin atmospheres. The cause of marine trenches oddly placed just off island arcs or continents and their associated volcanoes became clear when the processes of subduction at converging plates were understood.<br><br>Mysteries were no longer mysteries. Forests of complex and obtuse answers were swept away. Why were there striking parallels in the geology of parts of Africa and South America? Why did Africa and South America look strangely like two pieces that should fit to anyone having done a jigsaw puzzle? Look at some pre-tectonics explanations for complexity. For simplicity and one that explained a great deal more look at plate tectonics. A great rift, similar to the <a href="/e/g/gr/great_rift_valley.htm">Great Rift Valley</a> in northeastern <a href="/e/a/af/africa.htm">Africa</a>, had split apart a single continent, eventually forming the Atlantic Ocean, and the forces were still at work in the <a href="/e/m/mi/mid-atlantic_ridge.htm">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>. <br><br>We have inherited some of the old terminology, but the underlying concept is as radical and simple as "The Earth moves" was in astronomy.<h2 class="wk"><a name="hd7">Plate tectonics on other planets</a></h2>* <b>Mars</b>As a result of 1999 observations of the <a href="/e/m/ma/magnetic_field.htm">magnetic field</a>s on Mars by the <i><a href="/e/m/ma/mars_global_surveyor.htm">Mars Global Surveyor</a></i> spacecraft, it has been proposed that the mechanisms of plate tectonics may once have been active on the planet - see <a href="/e/g/ge/geology_of_mars.htm">Geology of Mars</a>.<br>* <b>Venus</b>Otherwise considered to be a "twin" of the Earth, Venus shows no evidence of plate tectonics - see <a href="/e/g/ge/geology_of_venus.htm">Geology of Venus</a>.<br>* <b>Galilean satellites</b>Some of the <a href="/e/g/ga/galilean_satellites.htm">satellites</a> of Jupiter have features that may be related to plate-tectonic style deformation, although the materials and specific mechanisms may be different from plate-tectonic activity on Earth.<h2 class="wk"><a name="hd8">See also</a></h2>*<a href="/e/l/li/list_of_plate_tectonics_topics.htm">List of plate tectonics topics</a><br>*<a href="/e/l/li/list_of_tectonic_plates.htm">list of tectonic plates</a><br>*<a href="/e/l/li/list_of_tectonic_plate_interactions.htm">list of tectonic plate interactions</a><br>*<a href="/e/g/ge/geosyncline.htm">Geosyncline theory</a>, obsolete explanation of mountain-building<h2 class="wk"><a name="hd9">Metaphoric uses</a></h2>Sometimes the idea moving tectonic plates is used metaphorically, e.g. "the tectonic plates have moved" in a <a href="/e/b/bb/bbc_tv.htm">BBC TV</a> news program describing the political effects of <a href="/e/a/ar/ariel_sharon.htm">Ariel Sharon</a>'s illness on 4 January 2005.<h2 class="wk"><a name="hd10">References</a></h2>* McKnight, Tom (2004) <i>Geographica: The complete illustrated Atlas of the world</i>, Barnes and Noble Books; New York ISBN 0-7607-5974-X<br>* Oreskes, Naomi ed.
