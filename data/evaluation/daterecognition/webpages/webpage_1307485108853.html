<p>Attention: Web Master</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="left"><strong>FRANCHISEES.</strong></p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">The following terms of use will apply to you only if you are an existing Franchisee of ours:</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left"><strong>FRANCHISE FORUM POSTS.</strong></p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p>The Franchise Forum will allow you and other Franchisees to post, upload, and display information (each posting of such information shall be referred to as a “Post”).  Any information loaded onto your Franchisee Page, as defined above, will also be deemed a “Post” and must comply with the requirements of these terms of use.  You are solely responsible for all of your Posts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the event that you make a Post, or a Post is otherwise made through any account of yours on the Franchise Forum or elsewhere on our Web Site, you will be deemed to represent and agree to the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The Post does not contain any personal information to identify you, your account or any other Franchisee, and, if it does, you accept all consequences of the dissemination of such personal information;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> The Post complies with these terms of use and other requirements stated on our Web Site;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> The Post does not contain any other information or content that we consider in our sole discretion to be inappropriate for our Web Site, or that we consider would reflect negatively on the FasTracKids franchise system;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> The Post does not contain any personal attacks on any person or entity, including us or any other Franchisee;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> The factual information in the Post, if any, is accurate and not misleading;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> The Post relates solely to your business authorized under your Franchise Agreement, and does not relate to any other business or commercial purpose;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>G. </strong>The Post does not contain any information, graphics, or other content that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(1) contains a virus or other harmful component or otherwise interferes with, impairs or damages our Web Site and any individual’s or entity’s use or enjoyment of our Web Site;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(2) is abusive, offensive, hateful, racist, disruptive, antisocial, defamatory, threatening, violent, vulgar, sexually explicit, pornographic, slanderous or otherwise harmful, including, without limitation, speech that attacks, insults, or demeans a group of persons based on their race, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, or veteran status;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(3) contains unlawful information; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(4) does not generally relate or is inconsistent with any discussion, topic or theme of any of the Franchise Forum or any other portion of our Web Site;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>H.</strong> You possess any and all necessary rights in and to the Post and the information in and content of the Post.  In particular, you may not make any Post or otherwise upload or transmit information to our Web Site that includes, displays, or reproduces in any way, trademarks, service marks, copyrighted materials, or other proprietary or trade secret information of any third party without first obtaining written consent of the owner of such intellectual property, trade secret, or other proprietary information;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I.</strong> The Post does not infringe any legal, proprietary, intellectual property, privacy right, contractual right, or other rights of any person or entity;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>J.</strong> We possess the right to change, use, delete, exploit and distribute the Post in any manner and at our sole discretion;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>K.</strong> We shall not be required to pay you or any person or entity any form of compensation for our exploitation, distribution or other use of your Post or any ideas, concepts, or other information or content in the Post;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>L.</strong> Any and all Posts shall become our sole property and we are therefore authorized to use the Post and any information contained in the Post in whole or in part, throughout the world, for any purpose, in perpetuity in or on any media in any manner without any compensation to you or any other person or entity;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>M.</strong> You will not impersonate any person or entity, including us or any of our representatives, or otherwise manipulate information in any Post to disguise the origin of the Post;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>N.</strong> All Posts shall be in compliance with your Franchise Agreement and any other agreements you have entered with us, and with our Procedures Manuals and other specifications and standards; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>O.</strong> You may not make any Post or otherwise upload or transmit information to our Web Site including large amounts of repetitive or untargeted content.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The open and real-time nature of the Franchise Forum and Post process makes it impossible for us to vouch for the validity and accuracy of Posts from individual Franchisees.  We do not monitor, endorse, edit or screen all Posts, although we have the right to do so in our discretion.  Posts do not necessarily reflect our views or opinions.  You acknowledge, understand and agree that we shall neither assume nor have any responsibility or liability for any Posts or for any claims, damages, injury or losses resulting from the Posts, or their use or appearance on the Franchise Forum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At our sole discretion, we reserve the right at any time and without limitation to (a) review, edit, or delete and remove any Posts made by you or any other Franchisee, (b) refuse to allow you or any other Franchisee to make a Post, (c) revoke your right or any other Franchisee’s right to make a Post or to use the Franchisee-only portion of our Web Site, and (d) use any means or mechanisms necessary to enforce these terms of use, or any other legal notices on our Web Site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you believe or have reason to believe that any Post violates these terms of use or any legal notices on our Web Site, please notify us immediately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You may not collect personal information about others on the Franchise Forum or without our consent and their consent.  Your use of our Web Site and the Franchise Forum shall in all respects be in compliance with your Franchise Agreement and any other agreements you have entered with us, and with our Procedures Manuals and other specifications and standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="left"><strong>VIOLATIONS OF TERMS OF USE.</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong> </strong></p>
<p>These terms of use, and your use of our Web Site, will be deemed to create an agreement between us and you.  A default by you under this agreement will be deemed a default under your Franchise Agreement.  If we elect to terminate this agreement as a result of your default, we may, at our discretion, elect to terminate your Franchise Agreement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSED PERSONAL INFORMATION. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any personal information you submit to the Franchise Forum in a Post can be read, collected, or used by other Franchisees, and could be used for any purpose, including to send you unsolicited communication.  Any personal information you disclose on your Franchisee Page may also be read, collected, or used by any member of the general public and used for any purpose.  We do not ask you to disclose personal information through the Franchise Forum or your Franchisee Page, but, if you do so, we may use such personal information for any purpose.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are not responsible for any personal information you choose to submit in a Post or on your Franchisee Page.  We make no guarantees as to the security of any personal information so provided.  We disclaim and you agree to release us from any liability resulting from your disclosure of personal information submitted in a Post or on your Franchisee Page.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any Posts or other information submitted through our Web Site may be maintained indefinitely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY FRANCHISEES.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As an existing Franchisee, you may receive personal information from parents or legal guardians interested in having a child obtain the products or services we offer or who have a child already enrolled in a FasTracKids program, and other members of the general public, through our Web Site.  The privacy policy on our Web Site establishes the terms for your use and disclosure of such information, and you must comply with the privacy policy, as the collecting party, related to all such information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER AS TO FRANCHISE FORUM.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE FRANCHISE FORUM CONTAINS THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF OTHER FRANCHISEES, WHO ARE NOT ACTING AS EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS OF OURS.  WE DO NOT ENDORSE OR GUARANTEE, AND WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY, VERACITY, OR EFFICACY OF ANY CONTENT, INFORMATION OR POSTS GENERATED BY SUCH FRANCHISEES.</p>
