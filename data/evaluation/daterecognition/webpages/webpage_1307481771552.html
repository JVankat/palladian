		As I may have mentioned once or twice in the past, my boss Barney (Air

		corridor cognoscenti for his dry but ready wit during bureaucratic 
		flaps. This especially comes to the fore when the mills of bureaucracy 
		grind particularly slowly or noisily, our political masters again fall 
		prey to the delusion that one of their current obsessions is an original 
		thought that has never failed before, or some allegedly new doctrinal 
		innovation in the ADF is trumpeted as an absolute war-winner but is 
		merely just new wine in old bottles labelled with <i>Powerpoint</i>.</font></span></p>

		The current pursuit of one billion dollars in annual �savings� for the 
		next decade from the Defence allocation has hit two of these hot 
		buttons. Barney, of course, was not taken in for a minute by the promise 
		that capability development and operations were ostensibly quarantined 
		from the chase. �Just watch�, he counselled the Chief-of-Staff and me 
		quietly, �how the bureaucratic classifications and descriptions of 
		various longstanding functions and activities will now mutate to cancel 
		out common-sense�s inoculable or prophylactic effect�.</font></span></p>

		murderously orphaned functions were then thrown on the block for 
		arbitrary slicing and dicing. Even more tenuously argued proposals soon 
		followed � especially as there was no shortage of ambitious candidates

		Born in the 1970s, and largely educated by post-modernists, I nodded vaguely at the

		allusion � with the result that the Chief-of-Staff added yet another

		believer in humour as the second line of defence against stupidity, then 
		sharpened his point about the resurgence of ultra-Maoist cultural 
		practices. Hunting up the old high-ceremonial jacket he wore when 
		defence adviser in New Delhi many years ago, he prominently hung it on 
		his office hat stand, surmounted by a flat cap and a little red binder.

		The first two or three bureaucratic butcher boys, popping in to brief 
		the VCDF on their latest sinew slicing forays, missed it entirely. 
		Feedback via the brew-crew rumour mill revealed that the next 
		enthusiastic butcher boy to visit was just as insensitive to subtlety. 
		He apparently thought the prominently displayed jacket was something to 
		do with the annual gripping controversy, fought by heated emails to and 
		fro across all six floors, as to whether the colder weather temperature 
		setting in R1 should be 19.5, 20 or 20.5 degrees Celsius. </font></span>

		It was not until the third or fourth visit by a keen knife-wielding 
		functionary that Barney was actually asked about the significance of the 
		ancient jacket and its symbolic accoutrements. The question had come at 
		the end of a briefing where Barney was told that all overseas exchange 
		postings were now regarded as both <i>administrative</i> and <i>
		expensive</i> and therefore a prime target for savage cuts. </font>

		Now a positively seething Barney is a rare sight. Like all fighter 
		pilots he is famous for his equable and even temperament, but he struck 
		and he struck hard. Pointing to the rounded edges and shape of the 
		jacket�s Victorian-era high collar, Barney noted its strong resemblance 
		to the Mao suits worn by victims during Cultural Revolution 
		self-criticism sessions. Building on the analogy he pointed out China�s 
		inwards-looking marked decline as a result of such measures. He further 
		reminded his questioner that overseas postings, in fact, saved money, 
		lives and national reputation. �How else�, Barney boomed, �could we 
		ensure comprehensive inter-operability with allies and friends, 
		operationally benchmark ADF professionalism effectively, and acquire key 
		professional experiences and qualifications simply not available or 
		feasible within our own resources�. �Moreover�, he slammed, �overseas 
		postings generally achieved all this at a fraction of the financial and 
		operational costs of the alternatives�.</font></span></p>

		Both his rage and his unrelenting stream of logic were a wonder to 
		behold. After the butcher boy in question had fled the power suite, 
		disarmed and in some terror, Barney throttled back, applied the flaps 
		and made a text-book three-point landing. His usual introspection soon 
		followed, coupled with his penchant for ably passing on lessons to the 
		successor generations. �Self-inflicted jerk injuries to the knee�, he 
		mused at last, �need surgeons not butchers and men not boys�.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I waited

		Defgram 493/2007, the <i>Enterprise Application Roadmap</i> promulgated 
		by the Directorate of Application Design (whoever they are, whatever 
		they do and whatever an <i>application taxonomy category</i> might be). 
		Ever so carefully I raised the subject that the latest reorganisation of 
		the VCDF�s responsibilities probably meant continuity in his staff 
		support structures was even more important than usual. �Perhaps next 
		year, boss�, I ventured, �you could release me to go back to the sharp 
		end�. Barney chewed on this option for a while, but now he thinks it was

		time-consuming duties. Being a helpful team-player at heart in the 
		(again) new ADHQ, Barney also offered to understudy his fellow occupant 
		of the power suite. His kind gesture to the Deputy Secretary, Strategy, 
		Co-ordination and Governance was based on the ever-lengthening, and 
		dissonantly diverse, functional responsibilities listed in the latter�s 
		title. The offer was politely declined, no doubt because of the 
		interesting precedent it might set, but also because some sensitivity 
		still lingers about this role.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Fifth-floor 
		rumour has it that when the need to split the VCDF and CJOPS positions 
		became obvious, and various options were being considered, the Minister 
		himself had wondered aloud at one meeting whether DEPSEC SC&amp;G might not 
		provide a suitable compensator for the extra military three-star needed. 
		Stunned silence followed by prolonged gurgling noises had greeted the 
		idea. The eruptions apparently stemmed from vigorously suppressed mirth 
		on the part of the uniformed members within earshot, bubbling-up horror 
		on the part of the senior public servants present, and even considerable 
		surprise among the ministerial staffers � not least because one of them 
		had suggested the idea the week before half in jest. Luckily the bells 
		rang. The Minister was called away for a division before the idea could 
		take firmer root or anyone suffer injury from choking. </font></span>

		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">An 
		important strategic-level priority is national protocol. As an aside, 
		Barney had been most impressed by the CDF�s new ceremonial kilt and 
		wondered whether he should get one too. I gently broached the subject 
		that unlike the Chief�s moniker, Stoush did not sound particularly 
		Scottish. Being orphaned quite young, the VCDF is unaware of his 
		family�s earliest origins in Australia. As a proud Furphy from County 
		Armagh, via Shepparton, I suggested that his family name perhaps denoted 
		an origin on the other side of the Irish Sea, as with the likes of 
		Hooligan, Skiddy or O�Brawl. But he was not to be put off lightly and 
		dispatched me to the library to see if there was a Stoush clan tartan. 
		Being a younger generation than the VCDF, a quick web search served even 
		better to dash his hopes in detail. But Barney brightened noticeably at 
		my compromise suggestion of the RAAF tartan, in its very fetching dark 
		blues, instead. The CDF is apparently now quite put out as he has 
		discovered his kilt is the Army tartan. Such are the delicate problems 
		of protocol, kilts and splits.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Since the 
		release of the Proust Report Barney has become quite insouciant and no 
		longer dissembles much about the heresies he harbours. Being VCDF he is, 
		of course, a principal victim of ever-increasing diarchic mutation, 
		whereby the diarchy at the top does not stay there but keeps grinding away 
		to lower and lower levels each year. Now 
		Barney, as a fighter pilot and a man of action, holds little truck for 
		amorphous management structures. His ever-firmer conviction that 
		diarchic principles are an anathema to effective command, control and 
		administration of a defence force mean he is now unlikely to ever be 
		considered for promotion to the smaller half of the two top jobs.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">His 
		reasonably relaxed resignation at curtailed career paths has only served 
		to sharpen his quippery. Noting the installation of a much bigger table 
		in the 5<sup>th</sup> floor conference room � to cater for the half 
		dozen or so new Under-Mandarin positions in the mill � Barney had 
		another Proustian moment. He told the Secretary that the production of 
		deputy secretaries and their equivalents should be formally added to the list of Defence 
		outputs, given that the department will soon have so many of them.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">One of the 
		new Under-Mandarins is to be a sort of super-duper chief-of-staff for 
		the newly formed Office of the CDF and Secretary, or is it Secretary and 
		CDF? Barney fears the worst. �The problem will be�, he mused, �that a 
		chief-of-staff in a headquarters should be one rank lower than the 
		principal subordinates to the person in charge, otherwise they are prone 
		to believe that they are <i>primus inter pares</i> instead of just a 
		behind-the-scenes facilitator of inter-commander effectiveness�. 
		Demonstrating his command of jointery, he cited the time-tempered 
		examples of brigade majors being one rank lower than unit commanders in a 
		brigade, and the chief-of-staff in a divisional headquarters being one 
		rank lower than the brigade commanders in a division.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">But the 
		VCDF has remained philosophical about the latest round of bureaucratic 
		empire building. His Proustian view is that only time will tell. Noting 
		previous departmental history, he observed that we are now only 18 
		months or so away anyway from the start of the next review of higher 
		defence management � and that yet again it will undoubtedly be 
		ostensibly intended at fixing all the unintended and ignored faults of 
		current and previous reviews.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">But it is 
		hijabs, or rather the perceived lack of them in the defence force, that 
		is now catching the 5<sup>th</sup> floor by the throat so to speak. The 
		president of the Lakemba Sports Club is ostensibly encouraging young, 
		hijab-wearing, Muslim women to become ADF reservists. He hopes to change 
		what he fears is the apparent negative image of Muslim-Australians among 
		the wider community. </font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Barney, of 
		course, was well ahead of debate when tackled by the first of many 
		intrepid SBS and ABC reporters about the proposal. He calmly noted that 
		our sailors of both genders have been wearing quite fetching hijabs at 
		sea for many years when at action stations. He also cited the custom in 
		downtown Baghdad for our diggers to wear a modest hijab whenever driving 
		their armoured vehicles outside the green zone. Only the air force, he 
		conceded, might appear at first somewhat culturally insensitive in this 
		regard. Although in their defence, he explained, anti-flash hoods are 
		not much use aboard aircraft or in air-conditioned environments. Later 
		he regretted the air-conditioning quip, remembering the tendency for the 
		hyper-sensitive to misconstrue any such remark as somehow constituting 
		snide criticism of the air force.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">
		�Cross-cultural sensitivity is so important�, our Proust-reading VCDF 
		noted to us subsequently. �Luckily�, he added, �our long experience with 
		integrating the three Services will hold us in good stead. Seeking to 
		convince the good mothers and fathers of Lakemba to let their nubile 
		daughters mix for weeks on end <i>unchaperoned</i> with unbearded, 
		non-Muslim, fellow diggers will be easy�. �After all� he concluded, 
		�look at all the long beards in the navy, and if we could eventually get 
		sailors permitted to wear DPCU occasionally � without admirals suffering 
		apoplexy at the sight � we can easily sort out the hijab issue�. </font>

		over three decades. The VCDF even offers to lend his copies to the more

		Long enough, even, to remember the last change of government and the 
		predilections of the other side when they were last in charge. In a rare 
		quiet moment the other day Barney cheerfully asked us all had we heard a 
		strange noise echoing along the lake shore? Confronted by looks of 
		puzzlement all round, he had claimed to hear the distinct gnashing of 
		teeth from far off Acton after the new Secretary�s appointment was 
		announced. </font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Barney now

		questioning forays to keep me on my toes as he flies by my desk on his 
		way out to attend briefings. A recent poser, no doubt prompted by the 
		change-over in the leadership of the federal Opposition, was for me to

		sprang to mind as did, after a bit more thought, his unlamented 
		predecessor. But then it got harder. I closed the door, stood at the 
		whiteboard and began to fill in the big gaps. After marking up recent

		review</a> of Peter Edwards� biography of Sir Arthur Tange reminded me 
		of an interesting daydream Barney, (my boss, Air Marshal Barney Stoush, 
		the VCDF) once recounted. This involved a Government �doing a Tange� 
		back on DFAT from whence Tange originally came. A newly-elected 
		prime-minister with reformist pretensions, and perhaps spurred on by an 
		anti-diplomat mindset, authorised the CDF to completely reorganise 
		Australia�s entire diplomatic and trade facilitation structures, on his 
		own, and without having to consult with anyone or be accountable for his 
		actions, ever.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">With such mandarin-type 
		powers our CDF abolished, amalgamated and gutted DFAT divisions and 
		branches willy nilly. He appointed former and serving ADF officers as 
		high commissioners and ambassadors as he liked, and ordered the 
		diplomatic finishing school to replace negotiation skills with infantry 
		minor tactics training. In an enduring masterpiece of empire building he 
		quadrupled the number of SES positions and appointed ex-ADF officers to 
		nearly all the new jobs. All the senior and experienced diplomats who 
		opposed his wholesale changes and wanted genuine reform instead were 
		retired. He then convinced the prime-minister to appoint a weak and 
		compliant senior diplomat as a type of under-boss and gave him the 
		glorified title Chief of the Diplomatic and Foreign Service (CDFS). 
		Finally, he imperiously decreed that there would be no reviews or 
		changes to the new structure for seven years.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">After a short time the 
		urge to interfere itched stronger and the CDF thoroughly reorganised the 
		total diplomatic establishment. He closed down diplomatic posts in 
		countries he did not like and fiddled with every small detail of how 
		Australia�s diplomats undertook their roles and tasks in everyday 
		action. In so doing he suffered not the remotest twinge of self-doubt. 
		Obviously he instinctively knew best how diplomats actually undertook 
		frontline diplomacy under any and all circumstances. Our rampaging CDF 
		and his willing ex-military minions throughout the department chose how 
		our diplomats walked, talked, dressed and toasted. To emphasise their 
		superior knowledge about even the most obscure technical aspects of 
		diplomacy they specified what cars deployed diplomats were to drive, how 
		many they needed, what colours they could be and whether they really 
		needed luxuries such as spare tyres, door-locks, jacks or street 
		directories. They also instituted a new policy of buying vehicles 
		fitted-for-but-not-with heaters for embassies such as Moscow or Beijing, 
		and then introduced the same policy concerning air-conditioning for the 
		cars to be used in Riyadh and Delhi.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">When frontline diplomats 
		complained of the safety, security or operational utility problems 
		incurred our zealous CDF sent them scornful memos and sacked the loudest 
		complainants. Others were exiled to Lagos, </font></span><font size="2">
		<span style="font-family:
  Arial">Harare</span></font><span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2"> and 
		Rangoon. Whispering campaigns were instituted to destroy the promotion 
		prospects of incipient critics by claiming that they were recalcitrant 
		types who simply 'could not get on with the military�. The more 
		persistent complainants were told time and time again that their desire 
		for a spare tyre or a door-lock was thoroughly unreasonable and was 
		�gold-plating� the requirement. Finally, our omniscient CDF insisted 
		that all car-jacks bought be made of cheap plastic as an economy 
		measure, and that only ten-year old photo-copies of street directories 
		be purchased. When questioned he snapped that there was no sound 
		operational requirement for more up-to-date ones as everyone knew none 
		of the cars would ever be used in action anyway.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Soon the new DFAT 
		structure became dysfunctional under the weight of all the internal 
		contradictions inflicted. But our CDF dynast relied on his trusted 
		ex-ADF officers, and a few laterally-recruited pet academics, to defend 
		his legacy and the career structure he had entrenched them in. When his 
		former ADF acolytes started referring to themselves as a �diplomatic 
		priesthood� he applauded and encouraged this as the status quo. Critics 
		among the real diplomats were simply derided as mere malcontents and 
		troublemakers. </font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">The masterpiece of his 
		reorganisation over the long term was his careful selection and grooming 
		of some careerist diplomats who saw which way the wind was blowing and 
		changed course accordingly. These �Uncle Toms� were promoted to higher 
		and higher rank. They could then be relied on to discreetly punish 
		junior diplomats who protested the destruction of diplomatic 
		professionalism and the decline in Australia�s proud diplomatic 
		capabilities. </font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Of course not everything 
		went swimmingly with Australia�s international intercourse. For decades, 
		every few years, various parliamentary and official inquiries were 
		regularly needed to tinker with the unworkable DFAT structure. Luckily 
		his disciples were able to rely on the short attention span of Cabinet. 
		This coterie of ex-ADF officers, academics and Uncle Toms were able to 
		keep snowing thoroughly over-worked Ministers as to the real cause of 
		DFAT�s by now deep-seated cultural and structural problems.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Barney's daydream reverie 
		was eventually disturbed, however, by the simple reality that no 
		responsible Prime-Minister would ever allow a CDF such destructive 
		latitude and then ignore the subsequent problems for decades. Neither 
		would any Minister for Foreign Affairs with integrity preside over or 
		defend such an enduring national scandal. </font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">After all, this would be 
		just like authorising an arrogant diplomat with no real military 
		experience to have an unfettered mandate to ignore military professional 
		expertise and completely change the way Australia planned and managed 
		its defence, how the defence force was structured and equipped, and how 
		it should actually have to fight. That would never do would it?</font></span></p>

		As my boss Barney (Air Marshal Barney Stoush, the VCDF) noted, with his 
		inimitable penchant for pithy analogy, few events better exemplify where 
		the emphasis lies at present.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Barney, as 
		always, has hit the nail on the head. After all we now live in an era 
		where the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence is tasked

		than the area RSM�s daughter. Not to mention this event being trumpeted 
		in a full media release to a less than spell-bound press. We seem to be

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Yesterday 
		evening after Barney had saddled up and left, and as we have now had to 
		do for some time, I dutifully dusted his desk and emptied his 
		co-mingling boxes (recycling bins in departmental management-babble) 
		into the one area rubbish receptacle now provided for the whole power 
		suite. When mopping out the kitchenette I was struck by the thought that 
		the new cleaning regime at Russell also paints a good picture of 
		departmental priorities and how the little things can get very big and 
		out of hand very quickly. The new nine-year corporate services contract 
		for the Canberra area has meant quite a hiatus in the building being 
		cleaned � as the incoming contractor waits for their cleaners to be 
		security-cleared. Apparently this will take some time as only holders of 
		457-visas from the third-world are available to work for the new wages 
		on offer and checking their backgrounds is naturally difficult and 
		time-consuming</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">This 
		morning, I was a bit late for work and did not get in until 0715. By 
		this hour, of course, all the Russell carparks were full and I had to 
		park down past the spooks. As I hiked up to R1, the lengthy time 
		involved allowed me to mull over some recent departmental fatwas and 
		spot the connections.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The zeal 
		about co-mingling, the perpetual problems with out-sourced contracting 
		and the micro-managing of Defence�s public image started to mesh 
		together in my mind. As I made the long trudge up the hill, and into the 
		final straight around Blamey Square, I heard a far-off whinny and was 
		reminded of a further example, the department�s new �travelsmart� 
		program. This apparently involves (as Defgram 465/2006 breathlessly 
		informed us) <i>travel options plans tailored to the needs of Defence�s 
		Russell Offices</i>, and features <i>a number of measurable options and 
		incentives to use healthier, more sustainable ways of travelling to and 
		from work</i>. This too struck me as yet another case of the 
		departmental habit of excessive effort over minutia and the mundane 
		rather than concentrating on Defence�s core business.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Barney, of 
		course, had been pithy on this contrast too. �Don�t these people know 
		there are several wars on�, he had barked several weeks ago, when 
		scanning Defgram 465/2006 on its swift passage to the relevant 
		co-mingling box. Later though, he had brightened up when planning how to 
		hoist them on their own petards.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Now Barney, 
		as VCDF, gets to live on the stellar street of heritage-listed 
		senior-officer married quarters in nearby Duntroon. The diggers call it 
		the Milky Way because of all its three and four-star denizens. In a 
		spirited and practical manifestation of �travelsmart�, Barney now rides 
		his wife�s mare over Mount Pleasant to Russell each morning and tethers 
		her up to graze on the hill behind R1, in full view of all the big 
		offices on the fifth floor. He also tried to stable her each afternoon 
		in his VIP parking space in the basement but this proposal did not get 
		far. One of the numerous deputy secretaries apparently vetoed it because 
		he feared the door panels of his adjacent Beamer were vulnerable to a 
		swift equine kick (not that my boss would encourage this of course). 
		Barney is more inclined to believe it was fear that Hornet (the mare) 
		might make a suitable, defgram-like deposit, on the gleaming duco.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">My special 
		discreet task from Barney this week has been to check out which 
		Australian musicians have not chickened out of going to Iraq to 
		entertain the troops at Christmas. My boss is an authority on all types 
		of modern music, both country and western, so he firmly believes finding 
		braver singers and dancers should not be a problem. �Just ignore all 
		that horse-#*&amp;! about some of them only refusing to go because they 
		claim to oppose the Iraq war�, he counselled, using a more well-known 
		euphemism for a defgram-like substance.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Ever so 
		carefully, I suggested that while musicians to his taste were invariably 
		possessed of more of a get-up-and-go attitude to life, this was not 
		necessarily always the case for their apparently less adventurous, 
		city-bound and generally more cacophonous counterparts. More 
		dangerously, I risked the opinion that perhaps the diggers were not all 
		C&amp;W fans, although probably not so picky about the musical genre of the 
		female dancers.</font></span></p>
		<p style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Barney, as

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">My boss 
		Barney (Air Marshal Barney Stoush, the VCDF) has copped his share of 
		flak lately about departmental and defence force bungling. His 
		consequent pronounced slough of despond was not helped when he was 
		consulted, more as a matter of form than for any responsibility he has, 
		on a proposal to renegotiate Defence�s travel contract with Qantas. 
		Slipped into the fine print was a clause that allowed travelling 
		one-star officers to be readmitted to the airport Chairman�s Lounges 
		they were summarily expelled from downwards in 1994. Barney, of course, 
		has a good eye for fine print and soon spotted the plot although most 
		had missed it. This discovery was followed sharply, in the VCDF�s 
		inimitable manner, by the demand for an explanation.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">The initial 
		and quite plausible explanation came from the relevant staff officer, an 
		ambitious up-and-coming wing commander now at home packing for his 
		upcoming posting to Woomera. He put it down to just the usual desire 
		from the bottom of the top pile to avoid what some saw as slumming it in 
		the standard Qantas waiting room. Barney, to give him his due never a 
		careerist or a rank snob himself, smelt a rat more strongly. His 
		suspicions (and posting decision) were confirmed when a smoking-gun 
		email from this officer was soon uncovered. This argued that wearied but 
		cosily relaxing business magnates were much less likely to go running to 
		Derryn Hinch with any defence computer disks inadvertently abandoned 
		among the cognac balloons and the caviar.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">The VCDF�s 
		mood picked up though later in the morning when he handed me DEFGRAM 
		295/2006 and claimed victory in our office�s monthly cannibal-defgram 
		hunt. Now, as all good personal staff officers know, defgrams are simply 
		a form of internal bureaucratic memo that record decisions or other 
		information that requires extensive promulgation. The rules of the game 
		are simple. The winner has to produce a defgram that announces a 
		decision cancelling something out within the previous 300 defgrams. (It 
		started off at 500 but this was found to be too easy given the usual 
		passage of time before the itch for managerialist fiddling is 
		scratched). Now 300 still might sound difficult but the Russell Hill 
		monolith churns them out in large numbers at an average of two or three 
		a day, or one and a half trees a month. </font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Barney had 
		noticed that 295/2006 cancelled out parts of 82/2006, the latter being a 
		big one whose subject was a traditional Department of Defence favourite, 
		re-organisation. I objected that his claimed examples (cadet policy and 
		the location of the Chief Information Officer) were not really 
		cancellations of note but mere re-arrangements. Now my boss is a hard 
		man but a fair one and he agreed to adjudication. We deferred, by 
		telephone so as not to waste time, to the Inspector-General as he is the 
		original inventor of the game. Alas he came down for Barney�s 
		interpretation.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">To his 
		further joy Barney then noticed that 82/2006 also mentioned Joint 
		Logistics Group. This is to be reinstated as a proper command at last 
		and separated out from its latest bureaucratic foster parent, after 
		being a bit of an organisational nomad for the last decade. After a 
		quick rummage in his bottom drawer Barney triumphantly pulled a coffee 
		cup ring-stained minute he had written as a two-star recommending 
		strongly against the original merger of the then Commander Support 
		Australia with the then Defence Acquisition Organisation in 1998. �Was 
		it so short a time ago� he had mused? I suspect his relish in this 
		instance was magnified by him also being the one who had pointed out 
		that the JLG had fallen off the new-beaut departmental wiring diagram 
		promulgated in late February (and due to take effect on 01 July). This 
		loss had been somewhat embarrassing for the department. Fortunately, 
		just before the end of the financial year, the Australian National Audit 
		Office had managed to find the missing organisation and kindly returned 
		it to Defence undamaged.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">It was 
		clearly a day where Barney�s luck had turned around. He went off quite 
		cock-a-hoop for the regular afternoon coaching sessions on things 
		strategical he provides the new DEPSEC�Strategy. These apparently 
		continue to go well because he is bombarding several floors with emails 
		and minutes on such matters &#8213; to the extent some have fled the 
		bombardment. The new deputy secretary I mean. Bombarding is just not 
		Barney�s style even though, like most senior Air Force officers, he has 
		a touching belief in the universal efficacy of bombing as a strategic 
		panacea.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">But the 
		elephant wandering around the fifth floor with ever-heavier tread is the 
		succession to the mandate of heaven. With the Secretary due to retire at 
		the end of the year the under-mandarins are unusually nervous. Oddly 
		perhaps, in a department of state with six deputy-secretary equivalents 
		(a Public Service all-time record by the way Barney noted) there is not 
		even the remotest prospect of an internal candidate. Their nervousness 
		apparently stems from not knowing who the next Shogun will be and, given 
		the PM�s penchant for diplomats, fearing the worst.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">None of this

		ever so gently, he appraised me of the lingering power of deference, 
		ancient tradition and form over substance. �It�s a bit like the powdered 
		wigs on judges and barristers� he counselled.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">As always 
		with Barney, this explanation was reassuring. Later on I realised that 
		he had commanded a squadron, wing, and a joint force on operations, and 
		also studied progressively at the RAAF Academy, RAAF Staff College, 
		Joint Services Staff College, the Royal College of Defence Studies and 
		two universities, just so he would be adequately prepared to coach 
		senior public servants in both strategic policy and the ways the defence force 
		could or could not execute it.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A heretical 
		thought has kept creeping into my head though. Perhaps someone like 
		Barney should do the strategy job instead, or perhaps the public 
		servants might be similarly career-groomed, trained and academically 
		(and otherwise) qualified before being appointed to the position.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">These

		matter: the newly published biography of Sir Arthur Tange, 
		(appropriately but perhaps inaccurately titled <i>Last of the Mandarins</i>); 
		and the book <i>Sea Control and Maritime Power Projection for Australia</i>. 
		Not that I was especially interested in the latter topic at first, but 
		it was written by Barney�s new Chief-of-Staff Operations, a Navy 
		captain, so I thought it politic to bone up a bit. The tome makes 
		eminent sense on several weighty force structuring and strategic 
		problems. No doubt when this is discovered all the Russell Library�s 
		copies will �be disappeared� and the author treated similarly by being posted as Defence 
		Adviser at our High Commission in New Zealand.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Another

		Co-ordinator� (R8-LG-060) but it was not to be. I was trumped completely 
		by the Flag Lieutenant to Chief of Navy with �Assistant Director Green

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Defence�s

		Public Affairs�. Now in one of those notable ironies that bolster the

		that the designer has a considerable sense of humour, this particular

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Barney is

		one well known among the retirement-planning cognoscenti. This mainly 
		relates to his shadowy status as the person who needs to know when your

		subversively reorganised the publications atop the coffee table, leaving 
		the well-thumbed issues of <i>Defender</i> and <i>Viewpoint</i> on top. 
		Our visitor discreetly ignored both publications, no doubt in 
		recognition that it might be construed as somewhat tactless to read them 
		with DEPSEC-S so close by. Instead he started to half-heartedly leaf 
		through a copy of the much more discreet <i>Defence Science</i> instead.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">When I 
		tapped on the door to advise the VCDF his visitor had arrived Barney was 
		himself leafing half-heartedly too, but through the far weightier 
		departmental <i>Co-ordination and Public Affairs Manual</i>. He looked 
		up from his desk with a finger stuck in what I recognised upside down, 
		as all good staff officers do, as the voluminous <i>Guidelines for 
		Defence Involvement in Interdepartmental Committees or Like Joint 
		Government Agency Groups</i>. Barney had apparently been attempting to 
		cross-reference a high-level policy edict therein with a pronouncement 
		in <i>Working Together: Principles and Practices to Guide the Australian 
		Public Service</i>. He sighed in relief at the interruption to his 
		thankless task, and slammed the volume shut with the type of definitive 
		action that has catapulted him to the highest echelons of the Defence

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Now Barney, 
		as VCDF, has little involvement thankfully in day-to-day personnel 
		policy or related administrative matters. As a three-star officer he 
		also has a definite use-by date in his employment contract, so the 
		discreet visit was obviously not about him personally. As I ushered the 
		ever-discreet visitor in to Barney�s sanctum I momentarily wondered as 
		to the purpose of the meeting, especially as it had been booked at quite 
		short notice by the DPE Nabob. No noise emanated from behind the closed 
		door, especially no begging, sobbing or even howls of joy. Eventually 
		the visitor quietly emerged, on his own, and discreetly slipped away 
		down the back stairs.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">When I took

		gazed out the window and looking like the proverbial cat with the cream. 
		This is probably why the CDF won�t let him play poker when socialising

		bait. My foray did, however, evoke his never long dormant penchant for 
		team-boosting anecdote. Barney remarked that he had not seen such 
		enthusiasm for providing ministerial briefings on personnel issues since 
		the last time the female junior minister was a good-looking blonde of a 
		certain age &#8213; and he was only a callow and bachelor squadron leader at

		Capability Systems Life Cycle Management Manual</i> (CSLCMM). Even more 
		usefully its list of applicable acronyms and abbreviations is down to a 
		two page menu for alphabet soup comprising only 74 ingredients. 
		Mercifully only three of them denote committees; although I noted the

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">This

		Committee now did seeing that the Defence Capability and Investment 
		Committee, among others, had usurped its role. After some thought he 
		confessed to a degree of puzzlement on the question himself, but perhaps 
		that�s because he is only an invited member. Eventually Barney proffered 
		the judgement that maybe it just hadn�t been abolished yet, or 
		transmuted into legal limbo &#8213; like the old inter-departmental defence 
		committee and the statutory defence council, which became zombie organs 
		of state because the civvies felt outnumbered when the CDF had the

		list. Perhaps they figured a timelord from the planet Gallifrey was 
		needed to make sense of <i>The ADF Requirements Development Information 
		System</i>. This naturally triggered a recollection of one of Barney�s 
		horror stories of the bad old days of capability development during and 
		after the Tange dynasty. Barney had commented in passing that 1980s 
		Force Development and Analysis Division types were nicknamed Daleks by 
		those too polite to openly question the legitimacy of their ancestry. 
		When I asked why, Barney said he thought it came from the timeless 
		philosophical dichotomy where the Daleks always referred to themselves 
		as �the <i>supreme</i> life form in the universe�, whereas everyone else 
		called them �the <i>most evil </i>life form in the universe�.</font></span></p>

		obsolescent and soon to be scrapped patrol boats, followed by a diagram

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">A few weeks 
		ago, Barney (Air Marshal Barney Stoush, my boss the VCDF) and I were 
		required to undergo one of the mandated regular seminars in sensitivity 
		training. I can�t remember exactly which type it was &#8213; gender, 
		sexuality, ethnicity, religion, multicultural appreciation, recognition 
		of sexual harassment, cross-species awareness &#8213; and it really doesn�t

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Luckily 
		this one was in a conference room with a window so I could partly pass 
		the time by watching the smokers and the shivering sparrows in the R1 
		courtyard idle another morning away. This soon unconsciously 
		transitioned into an efficiently time-zapping daydream about floating 
		the case for compulsory non-smoker sensitivity training.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">My reverie

		was probably judgemental and therefore insensitive and no doubt illegal. 
		It just goes to show how all this sensitivity training eventually seeps 
		into your paranoia glands. There didn�t seem much point broaching the 
		ethical dilemma with the contract zealot giving the presentation so when 
		a break was called I diplomatically woke Barney to seek his senior

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Before I 
		could raise the matter we were interrupted by Barney�s secretary 
		summoning us back to the office urgently. I wasn�t sure whether Barney 
		had pre-arranged this rescue or it was a genuine one, but on returning 
		to the VCDF suite we were met by one of the many departmental 
		functionaries responsible for public affairs. The PA guru was clutching 
		a canvas laundry bag which at least cut down on the intensity of the 
		hand wringing. Apparently some tabloid had printed a years old spoof 
		formal photo gone wrong, staged by some Townsville diggers, in which the 
		said laundry bags were used to imitate Ku Klux Klan hoods. Barney, who 
		being a senior ADF officer has no public affairs authority or 
		responsibilities until something goes wrong, immediately smelled a rat.</font></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">It seems

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">After the 
		spin doctor had left, Barney fell into one of his increasingly frequent 
		philosophical moods &#8213; perhaps his retirement as rumoured in <i>The 
		Canberra Times</i> is not far off. As one of the few senior air force 
		officers with a real experience of jointery, Barney is a fount of 
		considerable wisdom on the dark and mysterious corners of ADF culture. 
		No doubt prompted by thoughts about the likely impending witchhunts to 
		scapegoat the supposedly insensitive, he fell to musing on one of his 
		pet fixations, the department�s Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) 
		branch.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">As his eyes

		modern Australian culture but Barney, as usual, cut my waffle short.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">�Have you

		which are most virulent and most peculiar to our own profession�? 
		Warming to his topic he went on. �After all, as they mentioned again 
		this morning, unlawful discrimination is the making of arbitrary 
		judgements as to someone�s worth, effectiveness and career prospects 
		based on unjustified stereotypical perceptions rather than their 
		individual merit�.</font></span></p>

		and permanently inferior, followed closely by the blind snobbery of Arms 
		Corps officers in the army. Not to mention the way Principal Warfare 
		Officers just assume everyone else in the navy is there to enhance their

		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">As Barney�s

		asked that Barney return a call to the PM ASAP. When Barney rang back, I

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">�Stoush, did you see <i>

		watches television apart from war movie reruns. He claims films like <i>
		Tora Tora Tora</i> or <i>Midway</i> or are more informative and accurate 
		as well as entertaining.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">�I missed that one, prime

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">�Well, according to <i>
		Mateline</i>, there has been a coup in Upper Kunjingini. I�ve asked ONA 
		about it and they say they�ve never heard of the place so it must be a 
		defence matter. Find out why we weren�t warned and let me have a 
		report�.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">To cut a long story 
		short, Barney set up a committee to investigate the affair with himself 
		as chairman and me � you guessed it � as secretary. The first meeting 
		was a bit of a farce. Foreign Affairs did not send anyone because no 
		deputy secretaries were available to represent them, at an appropriate 
		protocol level, at a meeting chaired by an ADF three-star. International 
		policy division in Defence was represented by an acting EL2. The lad in 
		question was really a newly qualified graduate trainee who had been no 
		further afield than a post-exam holiday in Fiji the year before. Barney 
		assumed IP had sent him because of his unusually detailed expertise on 
		the region within the division.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">The DSD representative 
		said that Upper Kunjingini had no external communications. Their radio 
		transmitter had broken down and their telephone had been cut off for 
		failure to pay the bill. ASIO�s rep said it had nothing to do with them 
		because it was a foreign country. The ASIS rep said their closest thing 
		to a man on the spot, in next door Lower Kunjingini, had been expelled 
		because his cover as a Maserati salesman was exposed when he declined to 
		hand over a new model to the president for a mere $LK250.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">The relevant DIO area 
		desk officer � a newly transferred-in Arabic (not Kunjingin) linguist � 
		was not yet completely across all the countries on her new beat. She 
		did, however, produce an email referring to a briefing that had been 
		organised some years previously for a military mission to the Kingdom of
		</font></span><font size="2"><span style="font-family:

		The two ONA reps were triumphant (they now always attended meetings in 
		pairs to ensue a witness to any advice offered). They knew that the 
		fault was not theirs. It was truly a Defence matter � and they could 
		tell the prime minister so.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Barney scratched his head 
		a bit at all this. I could see that, accustomed as he was to 
		bureaucratic buck-passing (and not a bad exponent of it himself), he was 
		faced with the awful prospect of explaining yet another apparent 
		INTELLIGENCE FAILURE to the prime minister. That was when I won my CSC</font></span><font size="2"><span style="font-family:

		Operations Intelligence Centre in </span></font>
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Sydney had just arrived. 
		Perhaps, I told the VCDF, our new arrival could solve the problem.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Some present expressed

		intelligence matters.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Sergeant �Bulldog� 
		Drummond was duly summoned. Despite the name, Drummond was a slight, 
		clerkly looking and not very smartly presented. Barney, being an air

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">�Do you know anything

		<span style="font-family:

		he asked. �What coup, sir?� The confident query stunned the gathering. �<i>Mateline</i> 
		said there has been a coup�, argued Barney, �and that a new bloke called 
		Akepa is in charge�. �How would you know anyway?� sneered one apparently 
		inveterate newspaper reader.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">Being an analyst, 
		Drummond was silent momentarily as he pondered, but then smiled at the 
		doubting bureaucrat. �Well, ladies and gentlemen, when I interpreted for 
		the military mission to Upper Kunjingini, I became pretty friendly with 
		the King who enjoys a beer or three. I Iater looked after his son some 
		weekends when he started at Canberra Grammar�.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family:Arial"><font size="2">�He told me recently that

		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Barney (my boss, Air

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">'Have you absorbed some

		smirk. 'If you haven�t gained something, you�ve certainly lost some of 
		that waistline.'</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">He was right. Three 
		weeks spent checking out our latest overseas deployment had featured 
		hard slogging through the jungle, some pretty ordinary food (and not 
		much of it) and all without the benefit of some relaxation to pick up a 
		tan. Still, I felt as fit as I have ever done.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Barney had sent me off 
		as his personal envoy to see how the boys and girls were managing in a 
		pretty difficult part of the world. Now, of course, it was back to 
		reality; he wanted my report straight after lunch. At least, I�d got out 
		of the habit of lunch in the past three weeks but I�d also got out of 
		the habit of writing reports for our bureaucratic and political masters. 
		You see, I�d been living with people whose language was forthright to 
		the point of rudeness and who reported what was happening rather than 
		what they wanted to happen.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">Barney told me he wanted 
		a classified version and an unclassified version of my report. This is 
		pretty difficult to achieve these days. Once upon a time, it was enough 
		to do the full classified job and then trim out the classified bits for 
		the unclassified version that could go to the media and the politicians 
		- same thing, really.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">One difficulty with this 
		process these days is that the unclassified version has to demonstrate 
		that everything is going to plan so that no awkward questions will be 
		asked, least of all by the politicians who might even realise that real 
		wars are not fought by press releases.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">The other difficulty is 
		that someone is likely to leak the classified version to the media so 
		that politicians will be asked awkward questions. That�s another reason 
		why the classified version has to be kept from the politicians because 
		they are the most likely leakers.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">In a deployment like the 
		current one, the politicians need to be told that the populace loves us 
		unreservedly when actually they couldn�t care less, at least out in the 
		villages where they have not seen any form of government for 20 years.</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">It�s a bit different

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">But back to the report.

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I said I thought he

		it to Barney to decide. </font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">He explained. 'The real 
		figure is what the deployment costs over and above the standing costs we 
		would have to pay for the troops in barracks here in Australia. We 
		subtract the costs of the training exercises they would be doing back 
		here but add the food, fuel and so on consumed for the deployment. We 
		even add the travelling expenses for your inspection trip. Of course, we 
		also add in the pay supplement which adds quite a bit.'</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">'The leakable figure is 
		the real figure to which we add the ordinary running costs of having the 
		troops back here while the PR figure adds the standard departmental 
		overhead charge which is a fixed 500 per cent. This means that the real 
		cost does not look too stingy and adds credibility to the politicians� 
		claims to be saving civilisation in the region.'</font></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px">
		<span style="font-family: Arial"><font size="2">I objected that, if this 
		were taken to its logical conclusion covering all projects, we would 
		spend the defence budget three or four times over each year.</font></span></p>
