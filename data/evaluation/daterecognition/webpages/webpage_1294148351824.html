</div><P>It is now looking increasingly plausible that, at some point between
the middle of 1997 and the beginning of 1999, a number of EC Member
States (perhaps even a majority) will move to the final stage of
Economic and Monetary Union. The macro economic consequences of EMU and
the costs and benefits of participating are already the subject of
active and extensive academic analysis. Very little attention has so far
been given to the question of how a two-tier EMU, with only some EC
countries participating in Stage 3, would function and what implications
there might be for those remaining in Stage 2.
</P><P>The purpose of this Note is to highlight some of these issues, which
will need to be studied and understood in much greater depth before a
decision is taken. It looks at the legal and institutional framework set
out in the Maastricht Treaty, the relevant experience of nearly-fixed
European exchange rates from 1987 to 1992 and the economic and political
implications of particular country configurations in a two-tier EMU,
concluding that mutually satisfactory management of such a relationship
will require greater political will and co-operative spirit than has
been in evidence so far.
</P><P>Introduction
</P><P>Almost five years ago, on 1 July 1990, Stage 1 of Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) came into effect in the twelve Member States of the
European Community. Of itself, this was a quite minor step enshrined in
two pieces of secondary Community legislation(1) which formalised
existing arrangements and procedures for coordinating economic and
monetary policies. It did not require any amendment of the Treaty of
Rome and few of the Community's citizens were aware that it had
taken place. Yet that step was regarded by most Member States'
governments as a public affirmation of their commitment to proceed in
two further steps, to a single monetary policy and a single currency,
within the foreseeable future.
</P><P>1990 was, in a number of other respects, a year of considerable
significance for European monetary integration. The lira moved from the
wider ([+ or -] 5 per cent) fluctuation band of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism (ERM) to join the seven Community currencies already in the
narrow ([+ or -] 2 1/4 per cent) band and sterling moved into the ERM to
join the peseta in the wider band. Coinciding with the start of Stage 1,
on 1 July 1990 a Council Directive(2) requiring the complete
liberalisation of capital movements (by the end of 1992) came into
effect. On the same day, the monetary unification of East and West
Germany took place, seeming to provide an illustration of how, if the
political will existed, the creation of a monetary union and adoption of
a single currency need not be a traumatic economic or logistical
undertaking.
</P><P>Yet each of these events was before long to contribute to a crisis of
confidence that threatened to throw into reverse the process of European
integration. Within three years of the start of Stage 1, despite the
formal opening of the Single Market on 1 January 1993 and the signing on
7 February of the Treaty on European Union(3) at Maastricht, with its
timetable for achieving monetary union in less than six years, the sense
of Europhoria had all but evaporated. The ERM, which had come to be seen
as a guarantee of safe passage to monetary union, was breaking apart:
the European economy was in recession, unemployment and inflation were
both rising and public finances were deteriorating [ILLUSTRATION FOR
CHARTS 1 AND 2 OMITTED].
</P><P>Now, the conjunction of circumstances has changed again. Economic
recovery in Europe is under way, inflation is subdued, unemployment is
beginning to fall and public finances to improve. The reformulated ERM,
with its fluctuation margins widened from [+ or -] 2 1/4 per cent and [+
or -] 6 per cent to [+ or -] 15 per cent, has withstood its first major
test: the peseta and escudo were devalued by 7 per cent and 3 1/2 per
cent on 6 March but both currencies have remained within the mechanism.
The institutional development of the Community has also continued. Stage
2 of EMU came into effect in all Member States on January 1 1994, and
with it more extensive procedures for co-ordinating economic policies;
rules to constrain government deficits and the manner in which they may
be financed; and the establishment of a European Monetary Institute
(EMI) as the precursor of a European Central Bank (ECB). In what is
envisaged as the final expansion of membership before monetary union
takes place, Austria, Finland and Sweden joined the Community on 1
January 1995. Shortly afterwards the Austrian schilling joined the ERM,
bringing back to 10 the number of currencies in the parity grid.
</P><P>Against this more positive background, its principal supporters have
been regaining confidence in their vision of achieving Economic and
Monetary Union, in accordance with the terms and timetable of the
Maastricht Treaty, within the next four years. Reflecting the chastening
experience of the previous few years, however, this vision is more
circumscribed: the earliest date envisaged at Maastricht, is now less
than 2 years away and is no longer considered likely to see any
countries moving to Stage 3 of EMU; and the latest date, explicitly
provided in the Treaty, of 1 January 1999 is generally regarded as
plausible only for a limited number - perhaps even a minority - of the
15 Member States. The notion of a multi-speed Europe had a negative
connotation in the early-1990s - a small group of countries losing
interest in the wider European dimension and leaping ahead at an early
date, with divisive effect, to an exclusive monetary club for the
wealthy few. Now a two-speed or even a multi-speed approach to EMU, in
which some countries move ahead before others, is more widely accepted
as the only realistic way of both maintaining momentum towards the
monetary integration of Europe and meeting the key Maastricht
requirements of sustainable low inflation and sound public finances.
</P><P>Institutional Background and the Timetable for Stage 3
</P><P>From the outset, European leaders had envisaged that the route to EMU
would involve a sequence of steps. The European Council (which consists
of the Heads of State or of Government and the President of the European
Commission) meeting in Hanover in June 1988, charged that a Committee be
set up, under the Chairmanship of the Commission President, Jacques
Delors, to 'study and propose concrete stages leading towards
economic and monetary Union'(4).
</P><P>Reporting in April 1989(5) the 16-man Committee (which included the
Governors of the 12 Members States' Central Banks) proposed three
stages, in each of which action would be taken in parallel on both the
monetary and the economic policy fronts. Progressively closer
coordination of policies and convergence of economic performance during
the first two stages would prepare the way for the final stage in which
exchange rates would be fixed, a single monetary policy would be
formulated and implemented by a European System of Central Banks (ESCB)
and macro-economic and budgetary policies would be made subject to
legally binding Community rules and procedures. Adopting the conditional
mood throughout, the Report studiously avoided the political question of
whether this was a process on which the Community should embark.
Moreover, it warned emphatically against pre-set performance targets or
timetables for advancing beyond Stage 1:
</P><P>'The conditions for moving from stage to stage cannot be defined
precisely in advance nor is it possible to foresee today when these
conditions will be realised. The setting of explicit deadlines is
therefore not advisable. This observation applies to the passage from
Stage 1 to Stage 2 and, most importantly, to the move to irrevocably
fixed exchange rates. However, there should be a clear indication of the
timing of the first stage, which should start no later than 1 July 1990
when the Directive for the full liberalisation of capital movements
comes into force'.(6)
</P><P>Likewise the Committee recommended that not all Member States should
be obliged to proceed from one stage to another at the same time,
acknowledging the need for 'a degree of flexibility concerning the
date and conditions on which some member countries would join certain
arrangements' but also the need for those arrangements to be
managed in a way that would 'facilitate the integration of other
members'.
</P><P>In June 1989 the European Council in Madrid(7) endorsed the
recommendation that Stage 1 of EMU should start on 1 July 1990 but in
the ensuing negotiations there were marked differences of view among the
Member States as to how the closely inter-related questions of
conditions, timing and participation for the subsequent steps to Stages
2 and 3 should be addressed.(8) The outcome in the Maastricht Treaty
was, inevitably, a compromise in which the warnings of the Delors
Committee were set aside: Stage 2 would start on 1 January 1994 in every
Member State regardless of the degree of convergence actually achieved
by then. Stage 3 would start during 1997 or at the latest on 1 January
1999, but only for those countries who, in the course of Stage 2, had
been able to demonstrate a 'high degree of sustainable
convergence' as measured by four objective criteria (see Box 1).
Countries which are judged, largely by reference to these criteria, not
to have achieved a sufficient degree of convergence would be barred from
the movement to Stage 3 of EMU, and would be granted a derogation from
the Treaty obligations which relate to Stage 3, until such time as they
are judged to qualify. In addition, the UK and Danish governments
negotiated the right, set out in two Protocols, for their countries to
abstain from any move to Stage 3. The Maastricht Treaty thus not only
admits the possibility of a two-speed approach to EMU - and hence a
two-tier EMU in which some Member States operate at a higher level of
monetary integration than others - but virtually ensures it.
</P><P>Economic and Monetary Background
</P><P>In 1990, the economic and political situation in the European
Community had the appearance of providing a sound and stable base from
which a large majority of its members, adhering to the discipline of the
ERM, could proceed without serious strain to monetary union in the
second half of the decade. December of the same year saw the opening of
the Inter-Governmental Conference whose task was to provide the legal
framework for this in the form of a Treaty amending the Treaty of Rome.
Yet a number of diverse developments were taking place which were
shortly to interact with such violence that the whole project of
European monetary integration seemed at risk of collapse even before the
new Treaty could be signed at Maastricht in February 1993.
</P><P>One of these factors was essentially external to the European
Community: under the influence of monetary tightening by the Federal
Reserve, the long period of buoyant activity in the United States was
coming to an end and dollar interest rates were beginning to fall. On
the evidence of previous cycles, this might have been expected to
generate serious tensions within the ERM as mobile capital flowed out of
the dollar and into the D-mark rather than into other European
currencies.
</P><P>That this did not happen in 1990 or 1991 is attributable to market
perceptions of developments in the ERM itself. There had been no
significant realignment of exchange rates within the ERM since January
1987 as countries had adopted the 'hard currency' policy of
maintaining unchanged central rates with the D-mark. In the optimistic
political and economic climate of 1990 there arose a belief, among
market operators and official circles alike, that the existing parity
grid offered the currencies participating in the ERM a stable
'glide-path' to monetary union. This belief was reinforced,
rather than undermined, by the movement of the lira from the wide to the
narrow band (in January 1990) and by the participation of the peseta and
sterling, in the wider band, for the first time (in June 1989 and
October 1990 respectively). Consequently, extensive 'convergence
trading' took place as investors, assuming that the economic
performance of Member States would continue to converge in preparation
for EMU, moved into the higher-yielding currencies, which previously had
been regarded as higher-risk, in preference to the D-mark(9).
</P><P>The third factor, also apparently benign, was the unification of
Germany. Faced with the sudden demands for social spending and
industrial reconstruction in the Eastern Lander, the German government
resorted to market borrowing: the general government financial position
which had been in small surplus in 1989 (West Germany) showed cumulative
deficit of over 11 per cent of GDP (all Germany) over the four years
1990-93. Faced with this continuing fiscal stimulus, together with
rising wages in the Eastern Lander, the generous rate at which Ostmark
savings balances were converted into D-mark deposits and uncertainty as
to whether past monetary relationships would hold good in the enlarged
Germany, the Bundesbank progressively tightened monetary policy. It
raised its Lombard lending rate, in four steps, from 8 per cent to 9 3/4
per cent between November 1990 and December 1991, and then held the rate
at this record level for a further nine months [ILLUSTRATION FOR CHART 3
OMITTED]. The 'hard currency' policy being pursued by other
members of the ERM obliged them to follow suit [ILLUSTRATION FOR CHART 4
OMITTED] by raising short-term interest rates in their own markets or
postponing any reductions regardless of their individual domestic
economic circumstances. Reinforced by convergence trading, the European
currencies appreciated en bloc against the dollar as US interest rates
continued to fall.
</P><P>By the middle of 1992, however, the foreign exchange markets had
begun to question the sustainability of the parity grid and the
durability of the convergence process, in view of the cumulative loss of
competitiveness being suffered by Italy, Spain and Portugal (see Table
1) the effects of high interest rates on already large public sector
deficits in Italy and Belgium and the political will to maintain high
interest rates and a rising exchange rate against the dollar in the face
of growing unemployment and deteriorating fiscal positions in France and
the United Kingdom. Against the background of Denmark's rejection
of the Maastricht Treaty in its June 1992 referendum and the possibility
of a similar outcome in France in September, convergence trading
abruptly went into reverse and the parity grid rapidly started to
unravel. A 7 per cent devaluation of the lira at the beginning of
September was almost immediately followed by the withdrawal of both
sterling and the lira from the parity grid and a 5 per cent devaluation
of the peseta. By the following August the peseta had devalued twice
more, the [TABULAR DATA FOR TABLE 1 OMITTED] escudo had devalued twice
and the punt once and the 2 1/4 per cent and 6 per cent bands of the ERM
had been replaced - ostensibly as a temporary measure only - with a
fluctuation margin of 15 per cent.
</P><P>Implications of the Exchange-rate Crisis for EMU
</P><P>By the autumn of 1993, before the new Treaty had even come into
force, the process of monetary integration in Europe appeared to many
observers to have completely stalled and the Maastricht provisions for
EMU to be a dead letter. Although, assisted by recession, 6 out of 12
countries met the convergence criterion in relation to inflation and 8
out of 12 the interest-rate criterion, only Luxembourg met both the
fiscal convergence requirements (see Table 2) and it seemed likely that
government finances in most Member States would continue to deteriorate
for some time. Furthermore, there was now a major question mark over the
exchange-rate criterion. The Treaty requires that, to qualify for Stage
3, a country must have maintained its currency within 'the normal
fluctuation margins' of the ERM for the two preceding years without
serious tensions and without devaluation; this was unquestionably
drafted with the narrow band margins of 2 1/4 in mind. Reinterpretation
of the Treaty specification of 'normal fluctuation margins',
in the absence of a formal 2 1/4 per cent band, so that the required
[TABULAR DATA FOR TABLE 2 OMITTED] discipline was merely to have
observed the new (and supposedly temporary) margins of 15 per cent, or
even to have contained the movement of bilateral market rates de facto
within notional limits of 2 1/4 per cent either side of unchanged
central rates in the parity grid, could well be open to legal
challenge(10). Abandonment of the criterion however, would require an
amendment to the Treaty.
</P><P>More recently, however, with economic activity reviving, for the
majority of Member States there is a renewed prospect of
non-inflationary growth, converging long-term interest rates, lower
government deficits and a gradual reduction in stocks of government
debt. With this improvement in the economic climate has come a revival
of confidence that monetary union is attainable within the Maastricht
timetable, even though 1999 is now generally regarded as more realistic
than 1997(11) and the number of participants at the start is likely to
be fewer than originally envisaged. There is a growing acceptance that
some Member States should integrate more closely and quickly(12), as a
'core' - and even a 'core within a core'(13) -
around which the other Member States and European countries outside the
Community would form more loosely integrated circles(14). The
functioning of the ERM between January 1987 and September 1992, in which
at first eight and eventually eleven Member States maintained virtually
fixed exchange rates and accepted a common baseline - set by the
Bundesbank - for their monetary policies has been characterised as a de
facto(15) or quasi(16) monetary union. As this 'hard ERM'
broke up, so a tiering of monetary relations between the Member States
reasserted itself, with a 'core' group maintaining the
semblance of a monetary union, the other participants in the 15 per cent
band of the EMU forming an 'inner circle' and the three Member
States outside the mechanism an 'outer circle'.
</P><P>Before discussing the implications, and possible configuration, of a
two-tier EMU it is instructive to consider any lessons relevant to this
which may be drawn from the experiences of the 'quasi monetary
union' and its dissolution over the past few years. These can be
presented as a series of propositions:
</P><P>I
</P><P>A common monetary policy which is geared primarily to the needs of
one country, even if that is the dominant economy, will strain the
credibility of the union itself; in particular, each participant must
accept that the objective of the common monetary policy is price
stability in the union as a whole rather than the maintenance of price
and cost stability, or competitiveness, in its own national economy.
</P><P>II
</P><P>German reunification provided a valuable case-study of a
country-specific shock, in which a real appreciation of the D-mark was
required in order to secure the transfer of the real resources needed
for economic reconstruction in the Eastern Lander. The Bundesbank,
committed to the maintenance of domestic price stability, largely
succeeded in preventing this from coming about through a rise in the
German inflation rate. The other members of the ERM sought to prevent it
from taking the form of nominal appreciation of the D-mark against their
own currencies. Initially, therefore, the Bundesbank achieved real
appreciation by means of nominal appreciation of the D-mark (dragging
with it the other ERM currencies) against the dollar and other non-ERM
currencies. Over time, however, it also took the form of falling
inflation rates in the other Member States (in a number of countries
falling below that in Germany, which was rising); formal currency
devaluations within the ERM; and the sharp depreciation of sterling and
the lira on leaving the ERM. Between the members of a monetary union
exchange-rate changes would not be possible and, if the common monetary
policy were directed at the average rate of inflation in the Union as a
whole, more of the adjustment in relative prices would have taken place
through a higher rate of inflation in Germany, thus attenuating the
deflationary impact and unemployment consequences elsewhere within the
monetary union(17). For other Member States outside the union, however,
the dilemma over how to respond to monetary tightening within the union,
even if less acute, would have been essentially the same as in 1990-3.
</P><P>III
</P><P>The monetary stance of the Bundesbank was inappropriate to the needs
of most of the other members of the 'quasi' monetary union on
whom it was imposed via the linkages of the ERM. It follows that if the
Bundesbank's domestic tightening was correctly judged to match the
counter-inflationary requirement in Germany, it was more than would have
been required of a common monetary policy in a monetary union to
maintain a constant degree of anti-inflationary pressure in the union as
a whole: with a jointly-determined monetary policy, less of the German
fiscal stimulus would have been offset by monetary tightening. Hence in
a monetary union it is possible for any individual member government to
secure in its national economy, by unilateral fiscal relaxation, a more
expansionary mix of (national) fiscal and (common) monetary policy at
the expense of the other members of the union who would suffer a
somewhat tighter monetary policy in consequence. The Treaty obligation,
in Stage 3 of EMU (see Box 2), to avoid excessive deficits may serve as
a check on such 'free riding', but there would no longer be
any risk of censure in the foreign exchange markets and the temptation
to undertake fiscal relaxation may be kept alive by the dictates of
national politics.
</P><P>IV
</P><P>The experience of 'convergence trading' suggests that,
among a group of countries whose economic and monetary policies are
perceived as being appropriate and mutually consistent, national
governments may have equal access to international capital in a
'quasi monetary union'. If that perception changes, foreign
exchange risk - the risk of currency devaluation - will become the
dominant concern of investors and massive discriminatory capital flows
may take place across the exchanges. Within a true monetary union,
foreign exchange risk will be absent but, if inappropriate or mutually
inconsistent policies are being pursued, its place may be taken by
credit risk - the risk that a heavily indebted government which has
difficulty meeting its debt servicing obligations and is no longer able
to reduce the real cost of doing so by devaluing its currency will
resort to default. The risk of default within a monetary union might be
regarded by investors as less immediate than the risk of a devaluation
among national currencies but the potential for large-scale
discriminatory flows between the member states would still be there and
could result in a 'free-riding' government quite suddenly
being denied any further financing.(18)
</P><P>V
</P><P>A common monetary policy is likely to have an asymmetric impact
across the union because of institutional and behavioural differences
between countries. Differences in the responsiveness of other financial
markets to changes in money market interest rates and differences in the
net financial positions and interest sensitivities of personal,
corporate or financial sectors will mean that the burden of adjustment
will not be evenly distributed. The events of 1992 have shown that the
burden can fall particularly heavily where, as in the UK mortgage market
or the Italian government bond market, long-term indebtedness is
financed at floating short-term interest rates.(19)
</P><P>VI
</P><P>National differences in the timing and amplitude of economic cycles
will also cause the incidence of a common monetary policy - geared to
the aggregate conjunctural situation - to be uneven.
</P><P>VII
</P><P>If small open economies belonging to a monetary union have major
trading or financial links with countries outside the union they may
come under particular strain unless their outside partners pursue - and
are seen to be able to continue to pursue - policies which are
compatible with those of the union. This can be expressed in terms of
the theory of optimum currency areas: for such countries the monetary
union will not constitute an optimal currency area unless their economic
partners, outside the union de jure, act credibly as de facto members of
the union. The ERM experiences of Ireland (in relation to the United
Kingdom), Portugal (in relation to Spain) and Denmark (in relation to
the other Nordic countries) over the past three years illustrate the
problem. The economic case for or against a particular country's
participation in Stage 3 of EMU or, indeed, the viability of the whole
undertaking, can thus not be fully established in the absence of fairly
precise information about which other countries will be participating.
</P><P>Moving to Stage 3: Decision Procedures and Criteria
</P><P>The Maastricht Treaty (Article 109j) lays down a quite complex
procedure for arriving at a decision as to whether and when a move to
Stage 3 of EMU should take place and which countries will participate.
The reason for complexity is two-fold: the officials drafting the Treaty
shared the view of the EC Monetary Committee (of which many of those
officials were members) that although the decision should be based on
specific objective criteria these must be applied not in an automatic
way but with the exercise of judgement;(20) and they recognised that
several Community bodies have legal competence in this area.
</P><P>The European Commission and the European Monetary Institute (EMI) are
required, well before the end of 1996, each to report to the Council of
Economic and Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) their assessments of the extent
to which 'a high degree of sustainable convergence' has been
achieved, by reference to the fulfilment by each Member State of four
objective criteria relating to price stability, sustainable government
financial positions, exchange-rate stability and the markets'
verdict on the durability of convergence as reflected in long-term
interest rates (see Box 1). The two reports are also required to take
account of developments in 'unit labour costs and other price
indices' and current account payments balances, the integration of
markets, the development of the ECU and the conformity of national
central bank statutes with the independence requirements specified for
the European System of Central Banks.
</P><P>The ECOFIN Council is then required to reach a view, 'on the
basis of these reports' by qualified (weighted) majority, as to
which Member States fulfil 'the necessary conditions for the
adoption of a single currency' and whether those countries which do
so constitute a (single, unweighted) majority of the Member States. This
view is to be presented, in the form of a Recommendation, to a Council
of Ministers specially composed of the Heads of State or of
Government.(21) This specially constituted Council of Ministers,
'taking due account of the reports' of the Commission and the
EMI and of an Opinion from the European Parliament, is required, not
later than 31 December 1996, to decide by qualified majority 'on
the basis of the recommendations of the (ECOFIN) Council' whether a
majority of the Member States fulfil the necessary conditions for the
adoption of a single currency, whether 'it is appropriate' for
the Community to enter Stage 3 and, if so, when Stage 3 will start.
</P><P>If this procedure, or any early repetition of it after 31 December
1996, does not yield a positive decision before the end of 1997 - and in
principle such a decision could be one to initiate a move to Stage 3 at
a specific date several years ahead - the Treaty requires that the whole
procedure be repeated before 1 July 1998. Those countries which are then
judged (again by qualified majority in the specially constituted Council
of Ministers) to meet the necessary conditions, even if they do not then
constitute a simple majority of the Member States, shall move to Stage 3
on 1 January 1999. Those Member States which do not qualify to
participate in this move (or, in the case of the UK and Denmark,
exercise their right not to) effectively stay put in Stage 2 and move
automatically to Stage 3 when, in the course of periodic reviews, they
are judged to qualify; in the case of the UK and Denmark such a review
would take place only at the request of the government concerned.
</P><P>There are some interesting, and potentially crucial, peculiarities in
the majority requirements attached to this positive decision process.
For a decision before the end of 1997 to be taken that some countries
shall move to Stage 3, a (simple) majority of Member States must be
judged to fulfil the necessary conditions. The United Kingdom's
protocol attached to the Treaty, however, specifies that, if the UK has
notified the Council of Ministers that it does not intend to move to
Stage 3, it 'shall not be included among the majority of Member
States which fulfil the necessary conditions' which is required for
a positive decision before the end of 1997, and there is a similar
provision in the Danish protocol. It is clear, in this event, that the
UK and Denmark are to be excluded from the numerator in calculation of
the majority but there is no indication as to whether they should also
be excluded from the denominator. Thus if both the UK and Denmark
qualify and indicate their wish to participate only 6 other countries
would need to qualify to make a majority of 8 out of 15; but if neither
the UK nor Denmark were to opt for Stage 3 a majority would either
require 8 other countries (out of 15) or 7 (out of 13).
</P><P>Decisions by the specially constituted Council of Ministers as to
whether and when to move to Stage 3 and which countries are eligible
will require a qualified majority of 62 out of a total of 87 weighted
votes (see Table 4). Thus countries that between them hold 26 votes -
for example, the United Kingdom, Italy, Denmark, and Ireland - could
constitute a blocking minority. In a compromise agreement relating to
the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden there is a further
provision that where any Council decision is opposed by countries
holding between 23 and 25 votes, the decision must be postponed and
discussions continued without time limit. Thus in principle three
countries such as the UK, Spain and Portugal together could delay a
decision on the move to Stage 3, although to do so would be contrary to
the commitment, in a special protocol attached to the Maastricht Treaty,
that all Member States 'shall...respect the will for the Community
to enter swiftly into the third stage and therefore no Member State
shall prevent the entering into the third stage'.
</P><P>In 1996, while the Member States and Community bodies (Commission,
EMI, European Parliament, ECOFIN Council, Council of Heads of State or
of Government) are undertaking their first evaluation of the
appropriateness and possible timing of a move to Stage 3 of EMU, the
Member States will be following another, quite separate, procedure which
is also stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty. Article N. 2 of the Treaty
requires that a conference of representatives of Member State
governments (an Inter-Governmental Conference) be convened to address a
number of difficult political and institutional questions which may lead
to further revision of the Treaty. Some of these arise out of the recent
and the prospective enlargement of the Community. They are likely to
include the balance of voting powers between the larger and the smaller
Member States, replacement of the unanimity requirement by qualified
majority voting in a greater number of areas and the appropriate size of
blocking minority. Others concern the evolution of and distribution of
executive and legislative responsibilities at the Community level: the
balance of power between the Council, the Commission and the European
Parliament; the consultation and decision-making procedures of the
Community; and further development of a Community dimension in foreign
policy and defence and in justice and home affairs.(22) It is not
intended that the IGC should re-open any of the economic and monetary
issues which were resolved at Maastricht but it is nevertheless quite
possible that in practice conduct of the decision-making procedure on
EMU, and even its outcome, will be influenced by the course of
negotiations in the IGC: no terminal date has been set for these
negotiations and any changes to the Treaty will require unanimity.
Horse-trading in one forum could well spill over to the other.
</P><P>Possible Political and Economic Configurations of a Two-Tier EMU
</P><P>On the face of it, it does not seem likely that the Heads of State or
of Government will be able to decide by the end of 1996 that a majority
of the member States 'fulfil the necessary conditions for the
adoption of a single currency' and hence to set a date for the
beginning of Stage 3. Forecast data for 1996 (see Table 3) suggest that
only Germany and Luxembourg would meet all four quantitative tests. All
the other Member States would fail at least one of the two numerical
criteria relating to government finances. However, in conducting the
first of the annual 'Excessive Deficits' surveillance
exercises last year, the Commission and the ECOFIN Council judged that
Ireland, despite a debt/GDP ratio of almost 90 per cent, met the debt
criterion on the grounds, allowed under the Treaty, that the ratio was
'sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a
satisfactory rate'(23). If similar flexibility were exercised in
respect of budget deficits - on the grounds that they were close to 3
per cent of GDP and either had declined substantially and continuously
or were only exceptionally and temporarily in excess of 3 per cent -
France and the [TABULAR DATA FOR TABLE 3 OMITTED] UK might also be
deemed, alongside Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland, to satisfy all four
quantitative criteria. This would still leave the Community three
countries short of the majority required for a move to Stage 3, even if
the UK were to agree to take part and the problem of the ERM criterion
were resolved. A rather more heroic judgement, or a better than
projected outturn, in respect of debt/GDP ratios in Denmark, the
Netherlands and possibly Finland, could bring the number of countries
qualifying to the required total of 8, but even then a decision to move
to Stage 3 could not be taken in 1996 if the UK and Denmark were to opt
out.
</P><P>It is almost inevitable that political considerations will play a
part in these judgements and, indeed, in any assessment of the requisite
degree of exchange-rate stability within (or even outside) the 15 per
cent margins of the ERM. The stand taken by Germany will be of crucial
importance. The German Federal Parliament has declared that it would not
authorise its government to acquiesce in a decision by the Council of
Ministers which either weakened the Treaty criteria or departed from a
strict interpretation of them; but, in endorsing this position, the
German Constitutional Court acknowledged that a decision by the Council
on EMU requires an evaluation of whether the criteria have been met and
that differences of opinion are to be settled by majority vote(24). It
seems quite likely that the German government would approach the EMU
decisions with considerable caution but also a measure of flexibility,
in the exercise of which calls from the parliament (and no doubt the
Bundesbank and Finance Ministry) for rigour will be weighed against
external political considerations. In addition to any interplay with the
IGC negotiations, the potential repercussions for countries like
Austria, Belgium and Sweden, if they were excluded but their principal
trading partners were to take part, might give cause for delay,
especially if the economic conjuncture offered a prospect of some
further convergence in economic and financial performance. Indeed, the
Institute's latest world economic forecast, presented elsewhere in
this Review, suggests that the process of convergence in terms of the
Maastricht criteria could well continue at least to the end of the
decade.
</P><P>Although the questions of which countries and when remain open, it
may nevertheless be instructive to look at country groupings, selected
according to a subjective view of economic and political coherence, to
illustrate the manner in which the structure of the Community might be
affected by a two-speed approach to EMU. A plausible small 'hard
core' of countries that might move to Stage 3 on 1 January 1999
could consist of France and Germany (without whom monetary union would
almost certainly not take place), Luxembourg, the Netherlands and
Austria. Together these countries represent 44 per cent of the
Community's population and 53 per cent of its GDP (see Table 4).
Bearing in mind the development of the ECU financial markets and the
need to effect a smooth transition from the present currency basket to
the ECU as a currency in its own right, the four core-country currencies
(the Austrian schilling not being included in the basket) at present
exchange rates account for 65 per cent of the ECU basket. Yet the formal
political weight of such a 5-country EMU might be very much less than
its economic weight. In terms of the Community's present voting
structure, (although this might change as a result of the IGC
negotiations in 1996) the five would hold only 31 [TABULAR DATA FOR
TABLE 4 OMITTED] (i.e. 36 per cent) of the 87 weighted votes in the
Council of Ministers - a comfortable blocking minority (for which
normally only 26 votes are needed) but only half way to a qualified
majority (which requires a minimum of 62 votes).
</P><P>Of the 5 countries shown in the second group in Table 4, Belgium,
Finland and Sweden are assumed to have been excluded because of unsound
government finances, Denmark (because of domestic opposition and the
position of its three Nordic neighbours) to have exercised its right to
remain in Stage 2 and Ireland to have negotiated a similar concession
because of its close economic and financial ties with the UK. If these
various considerations were set aside and all five were to join the
5-country core either in 1999 or within a few years of EMU being
established, there would be an appreciable further consolidation of the
economic position of the union. It would account for around 53 per cent
of the Community's population and around 63 per cent of Community
GDP, while the ten national currencies, to be replaced by the single
currency of the union, would represent 77 per cent of the ECU basket.
</P><P>The shift in trading patterns which would result if the core
countries were to be joined in a monetary union by the inner ring would
be even more pronounced (see Table 5). 29 per cent of the core
countries' total merchandise trade takes place between each
other(25), 35 per cent is with the rest of the Community and slightly
more than that is with the rest of the world. The trading pattern of the
inner and outer rings, taken together, is similarly well spread: 33 per
cent is between themselves, 31 per cent is with the core countries and
36 per cent is with the rest of the world. If, however, the inner ring
were to join the core in a monetary union, 44 per cent of the
merchandise trade of the union would be amongst its members and only 21
per cent (equivalent to 5 per cent of GDP) would be with the five
Community countries remaining outside the union; in contrast, only 14
per cent of the trade of these outer five would be with each other while
47 per cent [TABULAR DATA FOR TABLE 5 OMITTED] (equivalent to 8 per cent
of GDP) would be with the ten countries of the union. This relative
self-sufficiency within the monetary union and relative dependency of
the outer ring on trade with the union could lead to frictions in the
development of trading policies and future Single Market legislation. It
could also exacerbate the asymmetry in monetary and exchange-rate
relations between the union and those countries remaining outside: the
incentive for members of the union to participate in an arrangement of
mutual obligations such as the original ERM would be much less than it
has been in a Community in which almost two thirds of all merchandise
trade is between individual Member States.
</P><P>The five additional members would also contribute significantly to
the formal political weight of the monetary union in the Community,
raising the number of weighted Council votes held within the union from
31 to 49-56 per cent of the total but still 13 votes short of a
qualified majority. Thus those remaining outside the union would retain
a comfortable blocking minority. Once Stage 3 has come into effect, the
lack of a qualified majority for the union in the full Council would not
be relevant to the taking of decisions concerning the economic and
monetary policies of the union, since only members of the union would be
entitled to vote on such matters. It would, however, be relevant to
Council decisions on other matters and could give rise to political
tensions between those inside and those outside the union. Even so, the
Community would not necessarily polarise immediately into two blocs. On
some issues France (and Belgium and Ireland) might feel uncomfortable
with the North-East tilt the other 7 members gave to the union. The
United Kingdom might equally at times feel ill at ease in a
predominantly South-West grouping of relatively poor and populous
countries facing endemic structural problems.
</P><P>Differences between the Stage 2 and Stage 3 Regimes
</P><P>The principal features of Stage 2 and Stage 3 are set out in Box 2.
The most marked differences between the regime to which those who have
moved to Stage 3 will be committed and that applying to those remaining
(or arriving) in Stage 2 will be in the sphere of monetary policy. On
the economic and budgetary policy front, the Treaty requirements for
Stage 3 are not much more extensive than those which have already come
into effect in Stage 2. The procedures for the co-ordination and
multilateral surveillance of economic policies in accordance with broad
guidelines laid down by the Council of Ministers are in place. So too
are the prohibitions on central bank financing of public sector
deficits, on privileged access for public sector borrowers to financial
institutions and on the Community or its Member States bailing out an
over-indebted government. Member States are already enjoined in Stage 2
to endeavour to avoid excessive government deficits (and excessive
stocks of debt) and are subject to peer group scrutiny and pressure,
with the possibility that an adverse finding may be officially
published; the difference for participants in Stage 3 will be that they
may be required to take specific steps to rectify the situation within a
specific period and may be fined for non-compliance, be obliged to
publish 'health warnings' when they issue debt or find that
the EIB will cease lending to them. Member States remaining in Stage. 2
will retain in full their rights to participate in all economic policy
discussions and decisions except the stiffer Stage 3 procedures for
non-compliance with the excessive deficit requirement.
</P><P>It is in the monetary sphere that the change of regime will be most
felt. For those moving to Stage 3, monetary sovereignty will be pooled.
Monetary policy will be decided in the Governing Council of the European
Central Bank and implemented by the Executive Board, either directly or
through instructions to the participating national central banks.
Exchange rates between national currencies will be irrevocably fixed
and, as rapidly as possible, national currencies will be replaced by the
ECU (although this could take a number of years). Foreign exchange
reserves will be pooled as will income accruing to national central
banks from the issuing of banknotes and from any compulsory reserves
held with them by the commercial banking system; much of that income
will then be re-distributed to the national central banks in proportion
to their contributions to the capital of the ECB. The Council of Finance
Ministers (excluding ministers representing countries remaining in Stage
2) will be ultimately responsible for deciding the exchange-rate system
or the 'general orientations for exchange-rate policy'
governing the relationship between the ECU and non-EC currencies.
</P><P>For those countries remaining in Stage 2, the national authorities
will retain their existing responsibilities for monetary and
exchange-rate policy and may well also choose to continue with their
present policy frameworks and techniques, although - as since the
founding of the Community - they will still be required to treat their
national exchange-rate policies as 'a matter of common
interest'. Their national central banks will not participate in,
nor be subject to, the deliberations or decisions of the Governing
Council of the ECB (although they may be asked to contribute to running
costs). In the event that some Member States do remain behind in Stage
2, however, a third decision-making body of the ECB will be set up: a
General Council will take over any tasks of the European Monetary
Institute which still need to be performed, as well as contributing to
the various advisory and reporting functions of the ECB. The General
Council will be made up of the President and Vice-President of the ECB
and the Governors of all the national central banks in the Community.
This provision would appear to allow for the continuation of the ERM in
some form, governing exchange-rate relations between the currency of the
monetary union and the currencies of Member States remaining in Stage 2;
but exclusive reference to relations with third countries'
currencies in that part of the Treaty which arrogates to Ministers the
powers of decision in matters of exchange-rate policy leaves some degree
of uncertainty on this point. The Treaty as currently drafted, also
requires that Member States which do not qualify for (or have an option
to refrain from) participation in Stage 3 at the outset must satisfy all
the convergence criteria, including participation in the ERM within
'the normal margins of fluctuation' before they may
subsequently be admitted. This issue is considered further below.
</P><P>Further Enlargement of the Community
</P><P>It is the intention of the present Member States to postpone active
consideration of any further increase in membership of the Community
until the outstanding issues regarding its institutional structure and
balance of powers have been resolved, as a result of the 1996 IGC
negotiations, and economic and monetary union has been securely
established. From about the year 2000, however, the question of
enlargement is likely to return to the Community's agenda. There
are no grounds at present for supposing that popular aversion to the EC
in Norway and Switzerland - economies which could be assimilated without
difficulty - will have diminished to such an extent that the governments
of those countries will be seeking to apply. Accession of the two
'micro-states' of Cyprus and Malta, with populations not very
different from that of Luxembourg, per capita incomes not very different
from those of Portugal and Greece and quite modest inflation rates,
should also not pose any major problems.
</P><P>However, at least 9 other European countries - whose economies so far
seem much less compatible - will [TABULAR DATA FOR TABLE 6 OMITTED] be
expecting to open negotiations leading to their accession: the Baltic
States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; Hungary, Poland and the Czech
and Slovak Republics (the Visegrad Four); Slovenia, and Turkey. To
enlarge the Community (see Table 6) to the east would represent a much
more radical challenge - both administrative and economic - than Member
States have faced in any previous enlargement. On present data, the
accession of the Visegrad Four countries alone would increase the
population of the Community by a sixth but would increase the Community
GDP by only one twentieth. GDP per capita in Greece and Portugal is less
than a third(26) of that in Sweden and Germany, but their population
represents only about 5 1/2 per cent of the population of the Community
of 15. Among the Visegrad Four, per capita GDP even in Hungary is less
than half that of Greece; in Poland and Slovakia (as well as Latvia and
Lithuania) it is not much more than one tenth of the EC average(27). Yet
in terms of population, the 'Visegrad Four' are larger than
the United Kingdom or France. Turkey has a population as large and as
poor as Poland. All of these countries have inflation rates at least
four times the Community average.
</P><P>In a detailed study of the implications of extending Community
membership to Central and Eastern European countries, Baldwin(28) has
estimated that the annual net cost to the EC budget of admitting even
just the Visegrad Four in the year 2000 might be as much as ECU 58
billion (ECU 38 billion under the Common Agricultural Policy plus ECU 26
billion of Structural Funds transfers less ECU 6 billion of budget
contributions from the new members), representing a budget increase (or
equivalent need for spending cuts) of some 68 per cent. His study also
suggests that, under current practices, these four countries would be
likely between them to receive 22 weighted Council votes - one more than
the four least affluent members of the present Community.
</P><P>A Multi-Tier Economic and Monetary Union in Practice
</P><P>The prospect of a two-speed move to Economic and Monetary Union among
the present Community of 15 raises a number of important questions which
will require serious and detailed attention from both academics and
politicians as the debate about dates and participation intensifies and
as the preparations for the Inter-Governmental Conference get under way.
Further enlargement of the European Community to embrace the Visegrad
countries, Slovenia, the Baltic States, the micro-states of Malta and
Cyprus and quite possibly Turkey, and hence the prospect of a three-tier
and even three-speed Europe, would raise many more issues still. The
purpose here is merely to highlight a few of those issues which have so
far received little attention and which need urgently to be addressed.
</P><P>It was pointed out above that a North-Eastern bloc in the present
Community of 15 would have considerable economic weight and an even
greater share of voting power - although still short of a qualified
majority - in the Council of Ministers on matters of EC-wide concern. If
the community of interest among these countries, already (or, in the
case of France, at least so far) quite strong on a number of issues,
were cemented by a common monetary and exchange-rate policy, a common
set of interest rates, a single currency and substantial internal
trading links, they might feel less inclined to accommodate the wishes
or needs of those remaining in Stage 2. In a three-tier Europe, with
major disparities in living standards and marked structural differences,
the question might be even more pointed. In the interest of safeguarding
what they had just secured, those who moved to Stage 3 might feel
obliged to pursue joint or national policies that exacerbate the
situation, or reject Community-wide policies or inter-Community
transfers that might ameliorate it, for those left behind. The risk of
this happening, for the countries outside the union, increases with the
number of countries in the union.
</P><P>Alternatively, it is possible that the steps already taken by the
Stage 3 participants to meet the convergence criteria in the Maastricht
Treaty might prove insufficient to offset the potentially disruptive
effects of residual structural, fiscal and political differences when
they are confronted by the demands of a single monetary and
exchange-rate policy. Internal strains might appear in the union and
cohesion might be undermined to the point where some participants might
see their interests as corresponding more closely with those of
countries in Stage 2. The risk, to the union, of this happening may also
increase with the number (and hence structural and political diversity)
of participating countries.(29)
</P><P>The question of fiscal transfers, at the Community level, from the
more successful to the less successful members of the Community may
perhaps be avoided, or at least put aside for the time being, if
monetary union takes place only among the members of the present
Community of 15. Centripetal labour mobility and centrifugal capital
flows together may be sufficient, and may be socially and politically
acceptable to exporting and importing counties alike, within the union
itself and even within the present configuration of the EC. With a much
more far-flung Community, of far greater economic, legal, linguistic and
cultural diversity, the degree of mobility and acceptability might well
be much less. If the concept of Community, and with it the Treaty
terminology of Economic and Social Cohesion, is to retain any meaning in
an EC stretching from Finland or Estonia to Malta and from Turkey to
Portugal, while encompassing the highly developed economies of the West
European core, the question of fiscal transfers from the richer Member
States to those who enter at the start of the new millennium can not be
shirked.
</P><P>A move to monetary union by a sizable sub-set of Member States could
pose a number of problems in the monetary sphere for those remaining
outside. As was mentioned above, the Maastricht Treaty allows for the
possibility, but does not require, that exchange-rate relations between
countries that have moved to Stage 3 and those which remain in Stage 2
be governed by the existing exchange-rate mechanism of the EMS, whether
in its previous configuration of 2 1/4 per cent and 6 per cent
fluctuation margins or with the present 15 per cent band. It remains to
be seen whether the 'temporary' 15 per cent formulation can be
reconciled with the Treaty criterion of ERM participation and indeed
whether it would prove sufficiently robust in practice to deliver
candidate currencies safely to the point of irrevocable exchange-rate
fixing.
</P><P>It does not seem likely that the ERM in its earlier form will be
re-introduced. Even though both the Committee of EC Central Bank
Governors and the Monetary Committee of the European Community shared a
consensus(30) in the spring of 1993 that the 'fault-lines'
revealed by the crisis the previous autumn were not in the exchange-rate
mechanism itself but in the inappropriate manner in which it had come to
be operated, it was already apparent that there was no longer the
political will to retain a symmetrically binding system of mutual rights
and obligations. If however, the ERM were to be retained in some form
once some countries had moved to Stage 3, the single currency (even of a
monetary union of five countries) would be much more dominant in the
parity grid than the D-mark has been and the rights and obligations of
ERM membership would be even more likely to be applied in an
asymmetrical fashion. This could pose particular problems for any
countries currently in the ERM who do not initially qualify for
admission to Stage 3 and who hence would have even less say in the
monetary policy of the monetary union than they may have had until now
in the (rather modest) provisions for monetary and exchange-rate policy
co-ordination in Stages 1 and 2 of EMU.(31)
</P><P>To abandon the ERM altogether might well be taken by those remaining
in Stage 2, and by the markets, to mean that the monetary union was
cutting itself free and denying them future access to EMU's upper
tier. Countries in the lower tier would be deprived of what had been
regarded as a valuable instrument of convergence. It would be open to
those countries unilaterally to adopt margins of fluctuation for their
currencies against the (fixed rate) currencies or common currency of the
union, but the monetary policy of the union would then dominate their
own economies to an even greater degree than would have been the case in
the ERM. As Britton and Mayes (32) have noted, such an arrangement might
prove to be regressive, making it harder for current members of the ERM
who do not join the monetary union at the outset to meet the necessary
convergence requirements subsequently.
</P><P>Moreover, such unilateral margins would allow twice as much movement
between the currencies of the countries staying in Stage 2 as between
those currencies and the ECU. Kenen(33) points out other disadvantages,
both to members of the union and to those remaining outside, of
unilateral pegging and argues the case for co-operative arrangements.
</P><P>One conclusion which we might draw from these brief analyses is that
if there is no longer a clear exchange-rate mechanism to provide a
formal framework for exchange-rate policy co-ordination - or even if the
constraints within such a mechanism are too loosely drawn - there may be
a need for a 'code of conduct', established in Community law,
to which the non-participating countries would conform in pursuing their
monetary and exchange-rate policies.
</P><P>A related set of issues arises in respect of the ECU. The Maastricht
Treaty provides that at the start of Stage 3 'the ECU will become a
currency in its own right', convertible into the national
currencies of countries participating in Stage 3 at irrevocably fixed
rates. The Treaty is silent about how, if not all countries participate
in Stage 3 and if the ERM were to be retained, this transformation of
the ECU could be reconciled with a continuation of the official ECU
basket for the purposes of the EMS. In principle the basket ECU could
co-exist - not only in the ERM but also in financial markets - with the
new ECU of the monetary union, but its properties would be different not
only from those of the 'single currency' ECU of the EMU but
also, to a lesser degree, from those of the basket ECU as it is at
present. The values of each, and interest rates on financial assets
denominated in them, could diverge considerably, with potentially
significant financial and contractual consequences for borrowers and
lenders, creditors and debtors and buyers and sellers.
</P><P>The consequences of a move by some, but initially not all, Member
States to monetary union would reach also beyond the macro-economic and
monetary spheres. A two-tier EMU would introduce new lines of
segmentation within the Single Market. With trade barriers and major
regulatory differences already removed, national differences in legal,
accounting and fiscal systems and of language and custom as well as
exchange-rate uncertainty all still stand in the way of a truly uniform
Community-wide market. Inside a monetary union, with at least one of
these remaining obstacles - exchange risk - removed, the playing field
will become more level than it is among the countries outside. This
could have an impact on the European strategies of firms, from outside
the Community as well as within. The further levelling of the playing
field within the monetary union, however, could also throw into greater
relief the national differences that still remain, especially those in
the fiscal area where pressures for greater harmonisation of tax regimes
and tax rates (and similarly social security contributions and benefits)
among the members of the union could intensify.
</P><P>Concluding Remarks
</P><P>This note has highlighted a number of issues which warrant further
study as the prospect of several Member States moving ahead of others to
the final stage of EMU draws closer. Political as well as economic
considerations suggest that such a move is unlikely to be as early as
1997 but that it is a realistic possibility for 1 January 1999. Which
countries would then take part would be for decision during the first
half of 1998, in the light of economic data relating primarily to 1997;
but it is possible now to envisage at least a core group of five or six,
consisting of France and Germany and several much smaller countries - or
perhaps even a majority of the Member States - then constituting a
reasonably coherent and viable economic and monetary grouping.
</P><P>Experience with the ERM over the past few years suggests, however,
that even for a fairly well-matched group of countries the operation of
a common monetary policy may at times give rise to economic strains and
political tensions. A policy directed towards price stability across the
union as a whole may not always meet the immediate domestic concerns of
a particular member of the union. Inflation in Germany, for example,
might at one time be higher and persist longer than the Bundesbank might
wish; monetary policy might need to be tightened before a cyclical
recovery was fully established in France or while the Irish economy was
being dragged into recession by the United Kingdom outside the union;
the impact of a particular action by the ECB might be felt more acutely
in the Netherlands than elsewhere. This non-discriminating nature of a
common monetary policy might also be exploited by individual governments
seeking, against the general policy stance within the union, to finance
domestic activity by borrowing, in the knowledge that the effect of a
compensating monetary tightening by the ECB would be spread across the
whole of the union: the efficacy of the disciplinary powers associated
with the Excessive Deficits procedure in Stage 3 has yet to be tested.
</P><P>With two-thirds of the Community's trade in goods taking place
between the Member States and trade with the rest of the world
accounting for only 8 per cent of GDP, there is a danger that a monetary
union will become inward-looking, the more so the larger its membership.
Not only trade relations but also monetary relations between the members
of the union and those members of the Community who remain outside could
become much more asymmetric than they are at present, the incentive for
the inner group to take into account the interests of those in the
outside ring being considerably reduced. It would also fall to the
members of the union and not the Community as a whole to decide on the
place of the ECU in the international monetary order.
</P><P>Coping with the internal strains which are likely to arise from time
to time under a common monetary policy will require of members of a
monetary union a greater spirit of co-operation than has been needed,
and perhaps than has been shown, so far. Each government that expresses
the political will to move with others to Stage 3 will need to be sure
that it also has the political will to persevere, in this spirit of
co-operation, within both the Council of Ministers and in the ECB
Council. If the commitment under Article 2 of the Maastricht Treaty to
'promote throughout the Community a harmonious and balanced
development of economic activities ... raising the standard of living
and quality of life, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity
among Member States' is to be honoured, the same spirit of
co-operation must extend also to relations between those who have
entered Stage 3 and those who remain in Stage 2. It is not clear that
the institutional and legal framework established for a Stage 2 in which
all Member States participate will be adequate to the purpose when some
members have moved on to a much greater degree of integration. Still
less do the present Stage 2 arrangements seem adequate to cope with a
significant eastward extension of Community Membership.
</P><P>Participation by the United Kingdom in a move to Stage 3 in 1999
could add considerably to the economic and political substance of the
union, subject to the same provisos as any other participant concerning
the political will and underlying economic convergence. It would also
help to ensure that the Community (and the union) acts, as required
under Article 3a of the Treaty, 'in accordance with the principle
of an open market economy with free competition'.

</P><P>1. 'a high degree of price stability': a sustainable price
performance and an average rate of price inflation over the previous
year no more than 1 1/2 percentage points above that of 'at most,
the three best performing Member States in terms of price
stability'; price inflation measured by the 'consumer price
index on a comparable basis, taking into account national
definitions'.
</P><P>Drafters of the Treaty specified 'at most three' Member
States to overcome the risk of an unrealistic target if one Member State
were to register a 'rogue' low (or even negative) rate of
inflation; 'at most three' is intended to set a limit to the
dilution of the criterion.
</P><P>2. 'sustainability of the government financial position':
absence of a deficit that is excessive as defined under the
'excessive deficits procedure' (to proscribe 'gross
errors'), ie:
</P><P>* a planned or actual ratio of government net borrowing to GDP no
greater than 3 per cent, unless it has 'declined substantially and
continually and comes close to' 3 per cent or the excess is only
exceptional and temporary and the ratio remains close to 3 per cent; and
</P><P>* a ratio of total general government gross debt to GDP no greater
than 60 per cent unless it is 'sufficiently diminishing and
approaching' 60 per cent at 'a satisfactory pace'.
</P><P>The numbers are not arbitrary: they reflect the average record of
those Member States which pursued prudent fiscal policies in the 1970s
and 1980s; 60 per cent is the figure at which the stock of debt will
stabilise if a country sustains a 3 per cent government deficit and
annual nominal GDP growth of 5 per cent (for example, 2 per cent
inflation and 3 per cent real growth). Technical terms and statistical
data are defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of November 1993.
</P><P>3. exchange rate stability: participation in the exchange rate
mechanism of the EMS, 'respecting the normal margins of
fluctuation', for at least two years without the Member State
concerned devaluing 'on its own initiative' the bilateral
central rate for its currency against the currency of any other Member
State.
</P><P>4. convergence of interest rates: durability of convergence and of
ERM participation being reflected in an average nominal long-term
interest rate over the past year no more than 2 percentage points above
'that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms
of price stability' interest rates measured on the basis of
long-term government bonds or comparable securities 'taking into
account differences in national definitions'.
</P><P>A margin of 2 per cent rather than, as for the inflation criterion, 1
1/2 per cent was intended to allow for an interest rate premium of up to
1/2 per cent in countries where long-term bond markets are less liquid.
</P><P>Other factors to be taken into account in assessing convergence:
</P><P>* the compatibility of each Member State's national legislation,
including the statutes of its central bank, with the Treaty requirements
(Articles 107 and 108 and 3rd Protocol) relating to ECB and national
central bank independence;
</P><P>* the development of the ECU;
</P><P>* 'the results of the integration of markets' (ie.
operation of the Single Market);
</P><P>* the development of balances of payments on current account;
</P><P>* the development of 'unit labour costs and other price
indices'.
</P><P>(a) Articles 109j(1) and 104c(2) and 5th and 6th Protocols.
</P><P>RELATED ARTICLE: BOX 2. TREATY PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE CONDUCT OF
ECONOMIC AND MONETARY POLICIES IN THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF EMU
</P><P>STAGE 2 (with effect From 1 January I994)
</P><P>Economic Policies
</P><P>* Member States to conduct their economic policies 'in
accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free
competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources'
(Article 102a), to regard them as 'a matter of common concern'
and to co-ordinate them within the ECOFIN Council (Article 103);
</P><P>* ECOFIN to adopt 'broad guidelines of the economic policies of
the Member States and of the Community;
</P><P>* 'multilateral surveillance' to be undertaken by ECOFIN to
monitor convergence of Member States' economic performance and
consistency of national policies with 'broad guidelines';
ECOFIN may make (and may publish) a Recommendation to a Member State
whose policies are not consistent with these guidelines;
</P><P>* the European Monetary Institute (see below) may submit Opinions or
Recommendations to governments and to ECOFIN on 'policies which
might affect the internal or external situation of the Community and, in
particular, the functioning of the EMS (Article 109f(4)).
</P><P>National budgetary policies and government finances
</P><P>* no monetary financing of the public sector, either through
borrowing from national central banks (Article 104) or through
'privileged access' to financial institutions (Article 104a);
</P><P>* no bailing out (taking over the public sector financial
commitments) of a Member State by the Community or by other Member
States (Article 104b);
</P><P>* Member States 'shall endeavour to avoid' excessive
government deficits (Article 109e(4));
</P><P>* 'Excessive deficits procedure' for ECOFIN monitoring of
compliance by Member States, on the basis of reference values for
government deficits and debt stocks (see box on Convergence Criteria on
page 79;
</P><P>* if ECOFIN decides an 'excessive deficit' exists it may
make a Recommendation to the Member State concerned and, if no effective
action is taken, the Recommendation may be made public (Article 104c and
5th Protocol).
</P><P>Monetary and exchange rate policies (Articles 109f and 109m and 4th
Protocol)
</P><P>* Monetary policies remain the responsibility of national monetary
authorities
</P><P>* European Monetary Institute established, with the task of
strengthening co-operation between national central banks and
co-ordinating national monetary policies 'with the aim of ensuring
price stability';
</P><P>* Exchange rate policies remain a national responsibility but each
Member State 'shall treat its exchange rate as a matter of common
interest';
</P><P>* EMI to monitor the functioning of the EMS and to take over from the
European Monetary Co-operation Fund responsibility for the multilateral
accounting and financing arrangements of the ERM;
</P><P>* EMI may formulate (and may publish) Opinions or Recommendations on
'the overall orientation' of monetary and exchange rate
policies and related measures in each Member State and on the conduct of
a Member State's monetary policy;
</P><P>* EMI to be consulted by Member States and by ECOFIN on any draft
legislation which touches on any matters in which the EMI has
competence;
</P><P>* EMI to prepare the 'instruments and procedures necessary'
for conduct of the single monetary policy in Stage 3 and, at the latest
by 31 December 1996, to specify the 'regulatory, organisational and
logistical framework necessary for the ESCB to perform its tasks'.
</P><P>STAGE 3
</P><P>Economic Policies
</P><P>* No additional powers given to ECOFIN;
</P><P>* ESCB (see below) required, 'without prejudice to the objective
of price stability', to support 'the general economic policies
of the Community (Article 105(1));
</P><P>* ESCB assumes from EMI the right to submit opinions to ECOFIN, other
Community institutions or national authorities, on matters within its
field of competence (Article 105(4); 3rd Protocol, Article 4(b).
</P><P>National budgetary policies and government finances
</P><P>* Avoidance of excessive deficits becomes mandatory (Article104(1))
and 'excessive deficits procedure' reinforced, with possible
sanctions:
</P><P>* ECOFIN, in a Decision, may specify remedial action to be taken
within a given period by a Member State which has persistently ignored a
Recommendation regarding its excessive deficit (Article 104c(a));
</P><P>* if the Member State does not comply with that Decision, ECOFIN may
require the Member State to publish additional information in
prospectuses for its bonds and securities, invite the EIB to reconsider
its lending policy towards the Member State, require the Member State to
make a non-interest-bearing deposit with the Community and/or impose a
fine upon it (Article 104c(11)).
</P><P>Monetary and exchange rate policies
</P><P>* European Central Bank and European System of Central Banks
(consisting of ECB and those national central banks participating in
Stage 3) established as soon as decision taken on a date for the start
of Stage 3, taking over the tasks of the EMi which is then liquidated
(Article 1091(1) and (2));
</P><P>* at the start of Stage 3, ECOFIN adopts irrevocable conversion rates
for national currencies of participating countries and between those
countries and the ECU, which becomes 'a currency in its own
right', and takes measures for 'the rapid introduction of the
ECU as the single currency' (Article 1091(4));
</P><P>* primary objective of ESCB is to maintain price stability; it is
also required, without prejudice to this objective, to 'support the
general economic policies in the Community' (Article 105(1); 3rd
Protocol, Article 2);
</P><P>* one of the ESCB's basic tasks is 'the definition and
implementation of the monetary policy of the Community' (Article
105(2); 3rd Protocol, Article 3.1);
</P><P>* European Central Bank takes over consultative functions of EMI
(Article 105(4));
</P><P>* ECB has exclusive right to authorise the issue of banknotes (which
may be issued by ECB or national central banks); approval of ECB needed
for issuing of coinage by Member States (Article 105a);
</P><P>* ECB to have recourse to national central banks 'to the extent
deemed possible and appropriate' to carry out its operations;
statutes of national central banks to be compatible with independence
requirements of Treaty (Article 108 and 3rd Protocol, Articles 12.1 and
14.1);
</P><P>* ECOFIN (acting by unanimity among participating Member States) may,
on an ECB or Commission recommendation and after consulting the ECB
'in an endeavour to reach a consensus consistent with the objective
of price stability', 'conclude formal agreements on an
exchange rate system for the ECU in relation to non-Community
currencies' (Article 109(1));
</P><P>* in the absence of an exchange rate system in relation to third
currencies, ECOFIN may, by qualified majority following a similar
procedure, 'formulate general orientations for exchange rate
policies' in relation to third currencies (Article 109(2));
</P><P>* ESCB empowered to conduct foreign exchange operations which are
consistent with any exchange rate policies determined by ECOFIN and to
hold and manage the official foreign exchange reserves of the
participating Member States (3rd Protocol, Article 3.1);
</P><P>* national foreign exchange reserves, up to an initial aggregate
figure of ECU 50 bn, to be pooled at the ECB; the remainder (with the
exception of 'working balances' which may be held by Member
States' governments) to be held and managed by national central
banks, but transactions by governments or central banks above a certain
limit to be subject to ECB approval (Article 105(3); 3rd Protocol,
Article 31).
