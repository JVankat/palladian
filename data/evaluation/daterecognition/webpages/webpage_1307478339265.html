<TITLE>Proceedings of the International Conference on integrated Fisheries Monitoring</TITLE><META name="description" content="The Conference was co-hosted by the Governments of Australia and Canada in co-operation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and with the support of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), USA, and the New South Wales Department of Fisheries, Australia. More than 160 delegates from 26 countries participated and 26 papers were presented. The Conference was held in response to a recommendation made at the 1996 FAO/Japan Technical Consultation on Wastage in Fisheries (Tokyo) which identified as a key concern the lack of reliable, basic level data from the majority of global fisheries, particularly when attempting to estimate global discards and the incidental mortality of non-target species. The purpose of the Conference was to address the challenges and opportunities of fisheries monitoring that are common to many fisheries. The Conference speakers, panel discussions, and workshops were organized around the following five main themes: 1) Rational for monitoring programmes - conceptual and legal frameworks, 2) Perspectives on monitoring from key stakeholders, 3) Designing, executing and analysing monitoring programmes, 4) Key components and issues for monitoring programmes; and 5) Integrated monitoring. The recommendation that came out of the Conference was presented to the 1999 Meeting of the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI). It stated that the FAO Fisheries Department should undertake the preparation of guidelines for the integrated monitoring of fisheries within the context of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries with the aim to improve the management of fisheries and the sustainable use of living resources, through the formulation of an appropriate framework for the collection of relevant data and information from fisheries and their associated ecosystems.

    <p><b>Abstract</b>: Catches may be monitored by observers to provide data for estimating
    removals of target and non-target species, for stock assessment and biological research,
    and for evaluating compliance with fisheries regulations. While a number of methods are
    available for monitoring vessel activity and accounting for catch, independent, verifiable
    information on catch, bycatch, and discard can be provided only by at-sea observers. Thus,
    observer programmes are essential components of integrated fishery monitoring systems.
    Programmes can be successful only if their objectives are realistic, the resources they
    are provided with are adequate, their organisational structure allows for collection of
    independent, verifiable information, and the observers themselves receive the necessary
    training and support. Furthermore, fishing industry personnel, observer providers, and
    agency staff must work together to ensure effective programme operations. In this review,
    we examine various aspects of catch monitoring by observers with reference to issues
    identified during a Canada/U.S. observer programme workshop, held in 1998, and lessons
    learned from the operation of two large observer programme: the North Pacific Groundfish
    Observer Programme, which monitors groundfish fisheries off Alaska, and the British
    Columbia Trawl Fishery Observer Programme. We identify the factors which must be taken
    into account during the design, implementation, and operation of observer programmes and
    offer recommendations for policy makers and managers involved in operating existing
    programmes or developing new ones.</p>

<h2><a NAME="P868_94328"></a><b>1 INTRODUCTION </b></h2>

<ul>
  <p>Commercial fishery catches are monitored for a variety of purposes. While specific
  objectives of monitoring programmes will depend upon the type and magnitude of the
  fishery, its temporal and spatial scope, and the strategies employed by its managers,
  there is always a need for accurate information on catch quantity and composition. Thus,
  in its simplest form, a catch-monitoring programme would be designed to document the
  quantity of fish harvested by a fishery and to provide this information with adequate
  temporal and spatial resolution. This type of data addresses information needs for
  scientists and managers. Managers must be satisfied that catch and bycatch limits are not
  exceeded and that catches are attributed to the correct gear types and management areas.
  Scientists must have accurate information on fishing mortality to conduct their stock
  assessments. They may also need information on size, age, sex ratio, maturity, feeding
  behaviour, and other biological characteristics by species, on the location of the
  catches, and on fishing effort. Scientists and managers may also need to monitor catches
  for lethal and sublethal bycatches of marine mammals and seabirds. Some fisheries are
  regulated heavily and may be subject to catch and bycatch limitations, vessel and/or
  gear-specific allocations, gear limitations, area closures, and seasonal restrictions.
  Under these circumstances, catches must also be monitored for compliance with fishing
  regulations. </p>
  <p>Catches may be monitored at sea, during or immediately following gear retrieval, or on
  land, at the point of delivery. Catches may be monitored by industry personnel, or by
  independent observers who are trained to collect and report accurate information. For
  catches processed at sea, shore-based monitoring is not possible. Even when catches are
  delivered to land-based buyers and processors, they cannot be fully accounted for without
  at-sea observation. This is because discarding and high grading occur in most fisheries,
  even if such practices are prohibited. In recent years, there has been much institutional
  and public concern focused on global catch trends and the magnitude of wastage in
  fisheries, yet the data to document and investigate these concerns is often inadequate.
  Many of these data quality concerns can be resolved only through the use of at-sea
  observers.</p>
  <p>Thus, while a comprehensive (or integrated) fisheries monitoring system may include
  vessel monitoring systems (VMS), paper or electronic logbooks, catch reporting by
  industry, and shoreside monitoring, it will, in many instances, require at-sea
  observation. Since observers are responsible only for gathering information, and they are
  expected to be independent and objective, they provide the only acceptable means for
  collecting certain types of fishery information. If vessel crew were assigned
  responsibilities for the collection and reporting of information, the results could easily
  become compromised by other vessel duties or conflicting interests. In addition, the
  standardised training offered by observer programme staff and the chain of custody
  provided for data, address the needs of scientists and managers for reliable and timely
  information. Observer programmes, however, are expensive to implement and maintain, and
  deployment of observers may be very difficult, particularly in small-scale, spatially
  dispersed fisheries. Furthermore, since monitoring data cannot be collected without error,
  accuracy and precision will often be of concern and this must be taken into account by
  those who design monitoring programmes and those who utilise the resultant data.</p>
  <p>With these and other issues of concern to those who manage observer programmes and
  depend on the data they provide in mind, a Canada/U.S. observer programme workshop was
  convened at the Alaska Fisheries Science Centre in Seattle, Washington, USA in March 1998.
  The workshop was attended by about 80 people and included representatives of observer
  programmes in the United States and Canada, and monitoring programmes in Argentina, Norway
  and the Caribbean Community Region. Consistent with the broad range of issues faced by
  observer programmes and the diversity of stakeholders, participants were drawn from
  national and regional government agencies, non-government organisations, private
  contractors, observers, and fishing industry groups. Agency and private sector
  participants provided perspectives from a range of disciplines, including science,
  management, enforcement, policymaking and administration. Meeting participants represented
  a number of distinct observer programmes, with differing goals and objectives, and ranging
  in size from a few hundred to tens of thousands of observer days per year. </p>
  <p>The perspectives which are offered on the use of observer programmes for monitoring
  commercial catches have evolved through our experiences with observer programmes in the
  groundfish fisheries of Alaska and British Columbia but have also been influenced by the
  discussions which took place at the workshop.</p>
  <p>This review provides an overview of fishery observer programmes in the United States
  and Canada and also includes more comprehensive information about two specific programmes
  in Alaska and British Columbia. The broad range of factors which influence the quality of
  data collected by observers is discussed, including programme design and structure and the
  establishment of appropriate objectives. Recommendations which may be useful for
  organisations considering the establishment of at-sea observer programmes for catch
  monitoring purposes or evaluating the structure and performance of existing programmes are
  offered in conclusion.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="P885_100023"></a><b>2 OBSERVER PROGRAMMES IN THE UNITED STATES</b></h2>

<ul>
  <p>Federal fishery observer programmes in the United States are implemented under the
  authority of three statutes: the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management
  Act, also referred to as the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA); the Marine Mammal Protection
  Act (MMPA); and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). While the conservation issues addressed
  by each of these acts differs, each requires data of the type which may only be provided
  by observer programmes, and two (SFA and MMPA) include specific provisions for fisheries
  observers. </p>
  <p>Observer programmes authorised under SFA generally provide information on fish catch
  and bycatch, and may support information requirements for in-season management, compliance
  monitoring, and biological studies. Those authorised under MMPA and ESA are designed to
  evaluate fishery interactions with marine mammals, seabirds, sea turtles, and rarely
  occurring fish species, and may be focused on concerns involving threatened or endangered
  species. Some programmes may be implemented under the authority of more than one statute,
  with data collection objectives established accordingly. The U.S. programmes which were
  represented at the 1998 Canada/U.S. workshop are summarised below. While this summary does
  not provide information on all U.S. observer programmes, it does serve to document the
  types of programmes in operation, and some of their important details.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="P894_101470"></a><b>3 OVERVIEW OF U.S. PROGRAMMES</b></h2>

<ul>
  <p>While most U.S. fishery observer programmes are implemented and managed by the federal
  government, some programmes are run by state government, and others by consortia which may
  include federal, state, and industry institutions. Sources of funding also vary. Most
  federal programmes are supported exclusively with government funds, but the largest
  federal programme, which monitors the groundfish fisheries off Alaska, has approximately
  20% government funding with the balance provided by industry. The State of Alaska's
  shellfish observer programmes are funded in a similar manner, but some U.S. West Coast
  programmes receive partial funding from federal and state government, and industry.
  Overall, U.S. observer programmes provide approximately 60,000 - 70,000 coverage days per
  year.</p>
  <p>A variety of service delivery models are employed. In some of the smaller federal
  programmes the observers are government employees, and in other programmes the government
  contracts directly for observer services. Observer services in support of the federal and
  state programmes in Alaska are provided by government-certified contractors. The agencies
  train and certify observers who are hired by these contractors. Fishing vessel and plant
  owners contract directly with observer companies for observer services.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P903_102797"></a><b>3.1 North-eastern United States</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>In the North-eastern United States, observer programmes are operated by the National
  Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Centre, in Woods Hole,
  Massachusetts, and the Commonwealth (State) of Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries.
  NMFS operates six distinct programmes in the Atlantic Sea Scallop Dredge Fishery, the
  Giant Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Purse Seine Fishery, the Large Pelagic Drift Gillnet Fishery,
  the Lobster Pot Fishery, the New England and Mid-Atlantic Gillnet Fisheries, and the
  Northwest Atlantic Trawl Fisheries. These programmes are designed to provide basic data
  for science and management, and they address a range of bycatch concerns and problems
  associated with marine mammal-fishery interactions. Small numbers of vessels participate
  in the tuna purse seine and pelagic long-line fisheries, and observer coverage levels are
  high. Large numbers of vessels participate in the other fisheries, and coverage levels are
  low. All programmes are mandatory except for the Northeast Atlantic Trawl Fishery, which
  has both mandatory and voluntary components. NMFS funds these programmes, and observer
  services are provided by a company which contracts directly to the agency.</p>
  <p>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts maintains an observer programme which collects data
  in the lobster trap fishery and the trawl fisheries for squid, flounder, whiting, and
  shrimp. Coverage is mandatory in all fisheries but the level of observation is generally
  low. Programme responsibilities include; supplementing the NMFS sea sampling programme
  described above, providing information for development of fishing regulations, evaluating
  performance of experimental fisheries, and evaluating the consequences of such regulations
  as mesh size restrictions.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P912_104597"></a><b>3.2 South-eastern United States</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>In the South-eastern United States, NMFS operates two observer programmes. The
  Swordfish Pelagic Long-line Observer Programme is operated by the NMFS Southeast Fisheries
  Science Centre in Miami, Florida. This programme is designed to collect data on effort,
  catch and bycatch quantity and biological characteristics, and information on fishery
  interactions with marine mammals, seabirds, and sea turtles. NMFS funds the programme and
  contracts direct with the individual observers. Between 2.5% and 5% of the effort is
  sampled, equivalent to approximately 4,000 observer days per year.</p>
  <p>The South-eastern Shrimp Otter Trawl Fishery is operated by the NMFS laboratory in
  Galveston, Texas. The programme's mission is to characterise shrimp trawl bycatch and
  evaluate gear types designed to reduce bycatch, Interactions with sea turtles are of
  particular concern. Individual observers are contracted to perform this work. Coverage is
  voluntary, and less than 1% of the 250,000 fishing days per year in this fishery are
  monitored by observers.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P921_105664"></a><b>3.3 Western United States (including Hawaii)</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>In the Western United States (including Hawaii), NMFS operates four observer
  programmes. The Offshore Pacific Whiting Observer Programme is operated by the Alaska
  Fisheries Science Centre in Seattle, Washington. The remaining three, the
  California/Oregon Drift Gillnet Programme, the Hawaii Pelagic Long-line Programme, and the
  North Hawaiian Islands Lobster Programme are operated by the NMFS South-west Regional
  Office in Long Beach, California.</p>
  <p>The Offshore Whiting programme involves 100%, voluntary coverage of a fleet of 16 trawl
  catcher/processors fishing off the U.S. West Coast; approximately 425 fishing days per
  year are observed and the data collected are used to support in-season management, catch
  and bycatch estimation requirements, and biological information needs for stock
  assessment. Since only 16 vessels are permitted to fish the offshore whiting quota, the
  companies involved have divided the quota into vessel-specific portions, and observer data
  is used by all participants to monitor the catches of each vessel and ensure that
  vessel-specific allocations are not exceeded. Observers are trained and certified by NMFS,
  and industry procures observer services from private, NMFS-certified observer contractors.</p>
  <p>The mission of the California/Oregon Drift Gillnet Programme is to document the
  incidental take of marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds, and target and non-target fish
  species, and collect biological specimens in the swordfish and thresher shark fishery. The
  programme is mandatory, and provides a coverage level of approximately 12% (421 observed
  sets in 1996). Costs are borne by NMFS, and observers are supplied by a private company
  which is under contract to the agency. In the Hawaii Long-line Fishery, NMFS deploys
  observers to document all species caught and collect biological specimens in this fishery
  which targets swordfish and several species of tuna. In addition to incidental takes of
  sea turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds, bycatch includes elasmobranchs and other large
  pelagics. NMFS funds the programme and employs the observers directly. In 1996, the six
  observers employed by this programme observed 5.3% of the fishing effort. The Northwest
  Hawaiian Islands Lobster Fishery Observer Programme is voluntary, and is designed to
  collect data on catch and bycatch quantity and composition, and to evaluate high-grading.
  In 1997, 66% of the 198 fishing days were monitored by observers employed by NMFS.</p>
  <p>Three additional West Coast observer programmes were also discussed at the 1998
  workshop. The West Coast Limited Entry Groundfish Trawl Programme and the Pacific Whiting
  Shoreside Landings Programme are both administered by the Oregon State Department of Fish
  and Wildlife (in association with several other agencies and industry organisations) and
  supported by industrial, regional and federal funds. The North Puget Sound Sockeye and
  Chum (salmon) Gillnet Fishery Observer Programme, was operated only in 1994 by the State
  of Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. These programmes are all voluntary. The
  mission of the groundfish programme is to determine discard rates in these fisheries and
  to document the circumstances under which they occur. Coverage is approximately 5-10% and,
  in 1997, 245 vessels harvested the 98,000 metric ton (t) quota during a 125-day season.
  The Shoreside Landings programme is designed to document Pacific salmon and groundfish
  bycatch and collect biological samples required for stock assessment. The average annual
  catch is 61,000 t. In 1997, 14% of the landings were observed. Trawl fishery observers are
  employed by the State of Oregon in association with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries
  Commission. Observers participating in the shoreside landings programme are employed by
  state agencies or fishing companies. </p>
  <p>The State of Washington salmon gillnet programme was designed to investigate the level
  of marbled murrelet and marine mammal entanglement in the non-treaty (non Native American)
  gillnet fishery in north Puget Sound. The programme was funded by NMFS and implemented by
  the State of Washington; 7% of sockeye fishing effort was observed during the 13-day
  season in 1994.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P937_109892"></a><b>3.4 Alaska</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>In the waters off Alaska, observer programmes are operated by the State of Alaska
  Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) and the NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Centre.
  ADF&amp;G is responsible for managing shellfish in state and federal waters, and requires
  observer coverage in five specific fisheries; the Aleutian Islands King Crab Pot Fishery
  (all participating vessels observed), the Bering Sea Korean Horsehair Crab Pot Fishery
  (all participating vessels over 44 feet long observed), the Bering Sea King and Tanner
  Crab Pot Fisheries (all participating catcher/processors and processing vessels observed),
  and the state-wide Scallop Dredge Fishery (all participating vessels observed except in
  Cook Inlet). In all cases, ADF&amp;G certifies observers who are trained by the University
  of Alaska, and fishing companies are required to procure observer services from private
  companies certified by ADF&amp;G. In 1997, approximately 3,600 observer sampling days
  occurred in the crab fisheries, with an additional 500 days taking place in the scallop
  fishery.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="P944_110947"></a><b>4 U.S. GROUNDFISH FISHERIES OFF ALASKA</b></h2>

<h3><a NAME="P946_110984"></a><b>4.1 The fisheries and their management</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>Management of fisheries for groundfish in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off
  Alaska began in 1977 following authorisation of the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and
  Management Act (as it was then known), and the resultant regulations under which foreign
  fleets were allowed to harvest groundfish in U.S. waters. Initially, these fisheries were
  carried out exclusively by foreign vessels but, over a period of 15 years, they evolved
  through a joint venture phase and into the current situation where the quotas are
  harvested only by domestic entities. These fisheries are large and complex. Substantial
  quantities of groundfish are harvested in the EEZ off Alaska, with catches of
  approximately 200,000 - 250,000 t per year. being taken from the Gulf of Alaska, and 1.5 -
  1.8 million t per year from the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands region in recent years. Major
  species are walleye pollock (<i>Theragra chalcogramma</i>), Pacific cod<i> (Gadus
  macrocephalus</i>), yellowfin sole (<i>Limanda aspera</i>), rocksole (<i>Lepidopsetta
  bilineata</i>) and other flatfish, rockfish (<i>Sebastes</i> spp.), Atka mackerel (<i>Pleurogrammus
  monopterygius</i>), and sablefish (<i>Anoplopoma fimbria</i>). The fleet is large and
  diverse, and includes catcher vessels delivering to motherships and shoreside plants, and
  catcher/processor vessels which process catches at sea. Gear types include bottom and
  midwater trawls, long-lines, and pots.</p>
  <p>Separate management plans have been established for the groundfish fisheries of the
  Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands area and each of these plans
  establishes a quota harvest management system for the major groundfish species or species
  groups. Each year, stock assessments are performed, and the assessment scientists make
  recommendations for Allowable Biological Catches (ABCs). Based on these recommendations,
  the North Pacific Fishery Management Council recommends Total Allowable Catches (TACs)
  which are implemented by NMFS. TACs may be apportioned by area, season, and/or gear type
  and are generally managed in a manner which allows the major portion to be harvested by
  target-specific directed fisheries but provides sufficient quantities to meet bycatch
  requirements in fisheries where they are not targeted. Certain species which are taken in
  these fisheries may not be retained because their harvestable biomasses are fully utilised
  in other fisheries. These include Pacific halibut (<i>Hippoglossus stenolepis</i>),
  Pacific herring (<i>Clupea harengus pallasi</i>), salmonids, and several species of crab.
  In most cases, possession of these species on commercial groundfish vessels is illegal.
  However, this bycatch must be accounted for and, in the case of Pacific halibut, bycaught
  animals must be returned to the sea as quickly as possible and with minimal injury.
  Incentives to reduce bycatch of these Prohibited Species (PSC) include fleetwide bycatch
  quotas (or caps) in some fisheries, and requirements for individual vessels to keep
  certain PSC bycatch rates within limits in some fisheries (Pennoyer 1997).</p>
  <p>In the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands Area, a certain portion of the TAC (10% for pollock
  and 7.5% for other species) is set aside for the Community Development Quota (CDQ)
  programme. Under this programme, the CDQ is divided among a number of Western Alaska
  native community groups to be utilised for fisheries-related economic development. In
  general, these community groups have leased CDQ harvest rights to existing fishing
  companies so that these companies and, in some cases, the individual vessels which they
  own, may harvest only the specific quantity of CDQ catch that they have contracted to
  purchase.</p>
  <p>The information requirements for managing these fisheries are substantial, and, since
  much of the catch is processed offshore, in-season management of quotas and PSC caps
  depends, to a large extent, on monitoring by independent fisheries observers. Furthermore,
  stock assessment scientists require detailed information on catch quantity, composition,
  and temporal and spatial distribution which would be difficult, or perhaps impossible to
  obtain without a large and well-trained corps of observers. </p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P959_115146"></a><b>4.2 Monitoring: The North Pacific Groundfish Observer
Programme (NPGOP)</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>Placement of observers aboard foreign vessels harvesting groundfish off the U.S. West
  Coast and Alaska began in 1973. Initially, this was a small programme and observers were
  deployed only upon invitation of the host countries. The programme was greatly expanded in
  the late 1970s, when observer coverage on foreign vessels became mandatory, and a
  condition of the permits which were required of all participants in these fisheries,
  following implementation of the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (French
  <i>et al.</i> 1982). Coverage requirements were maintained as the fisheries evolved, from
  exclusively foreign, through a joint-venture phase to the exclusively domestic fishery,
  which has been in place since 1990. Regulations issued in 1990 established the current
  domestic observer programme with 30% coverage requirements for groundfish vessels of 60 ft
  - 125 ft length overall (LOA), 100% coverage requirements for vessels greater than 125 ft
  LOA, and coverage at shoreside processing plants based on the quantity of fish processed
  each month. In 1997, the programme deployed approximately 500 observers for about 30,000
  coverage days.</p>
  <p>The programme is expensive to operate since vessels are deployed from ports throughout
  Alaska and, in some cases, Washington and Oregon. The large factory trawlers may stay at
  sea for up to three months at a time, while many of the smaller catcher vessels must
  return to port every few days. The annual cost of operating the programme is $US10-12
  million. Approximately $US2.5 million is provided each year by the federal government.
  This covers costs associated with training observers, providing them with safety and
  sampling equipment and supplies, supporting them in the field, debriefing them upon return
  from the field, and all the expenses associated with managing and disseminating the data
  they collect. Direct observer costs, including costs associated with deployment, observer
  salaries and benefits, and insurance are borne by the fishing industry. Under the service
  delivery model currently in place, NMFS is responsible for training and certifying all
  observers, and the observers are hired by one of the five private companies certified by
  NMFS to provide observer services. Fishing companies required to obtain observers must
  contract directly with one of these five companies. Observer companies charge between
  $US250 and $US300 per observer per day. In 1990, when this system was first put in place,
  it was recognised that this service delivery model was not consistent with the requirement
  for collecting independent, verifiable information and a commitment was made to devise a
  replacement procurement system which would be free from the potential for conflict of
  interest. This has yet to occur.</p>
  <p>North Pacific groundfish observers are trained to perform a variety of functions
  including the collection of data on the quantity and composition of catch and bycatch,
  fishing effort, biological characteristics of catch species, fishery interactions with
  marine mammals and seabirds, and compliance with federal fisheries regulations. Observers
  file reports electronically on a weekly or daily basis, and their data are used in near
  real time by in-season managers who must project fishery closures based on their best
  estimate of when catch, bycatch, or PSC limits will be reached. Certain PSC species are
  taken in very small quantities, and observers must make special efforts to account for
  them and, in the case of Pacific halibut, observers must document handling procedures and
  the condition of halibut returned to the sea such that compliance with special handling
  regulations can be evaluated. Observers also monitor for compliance with a number of other
  regulations including those designed to reduce or eliminate discard of certain species,
  prevent the discharge of oil or dumping of general waste, and maintain gear type, time, or
  area based management restrictions. In the CDQ fisheries, the catch of each participating
  vessel is monitored by the observers on board, and fishing must cease when limits are
  reached. Observers monitoring in the long-line fisheries are trained to pay special
  attention to lethal bycatch of birds, and measures taken by crew to prevent them.
  Mortalities of the endangered short-tailed albatross (<i>Diomedia albatrus</i>)
  occasionally occur in this fleet, and can induce closure of the fishery if these
  mortalities exceed the small, allowable bycatch of this species. While uncommon, lethal
  bycatch of various marine mammals, some of which are threatened or endangered, also
  occurs.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="P970_119804"></a><b>5 OBSERVER PROGRAMMES IN CANADA</b></h2>

<ul>
  <p>Fishery observer programmes in Canada are authorised under the federal Fisheries Act
  for domestic fisheries and the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act (for foreign national
  vessels fishing within the Canadian EEZ). The Fishery (General) Regulations are the main
  instrument that provides for at sea observing activities by authorising the Department of
  Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) to place observers aboard fishing vessels, providing legal
  designation of observers, defining observer rights and duties, and defining the
  obligations of the vessel master toward observers. Information requirements of observer
  programmes are often mandated by fishery management plans and departmental policy,
  although the recently enacted Oceans Act will place a legislative requirement for certain
  types of fishery information available through observer programmes.</p>
  <p>Observer programmes throughout Canada follow a consistent pattern of government
  control, programme delivery by private contractors and cost sharing by industry and
  government. DFO's Conservation and Protection Directorate provides national co-ordination
  for observer programmes, promoting programme consistency among the five regional DFO
  offices (four Atlantic and one Pacific) that each oversee and co-ordinate the delivery of
  individual programmes by contract with private sector firms. In general, there is a
  consistent approach to funding arrangements throughout Canada for domestic fisheries with
  DFO paying the programme administration costs (about 30% of the total programme cost) and
  industry paying for the costs of the observer. Foreign flag state vessels conducting
  fishing operations within the Canadian EEZ generally pay the full cost of observer
  programmes, including programme administration. The tri-party relationship between
  government, contractors and industry assigns contractors the responsibility for service
  delivery including: recruitment, training, deployment, briefing/debriefing and supervision
  of observers; data quality assurance and delivery; contract administration and management;
  and interaction with government and industry. Government is responsible for programme
  delivery through its control of the regulatory regime, the contracting process,
  requirements and administration, coverage levels, deployment strategy and policy, and
  product quality management. Industry is responsible for carrying observers as required and
  paying the associated costs.</p>
  <p>The Government-contractor relationship is regulated through contracts and a Government
  observer-certification process. Observer service contracts are awarded through an open and
  competitive process, to establish a single observer service provider for each of the five
  DFO regions. By authorising a contractor the exclusive right to deliver observer services
  within a specific geographic area for a specific time period, this model avoids the
  conflicts of interest that would arise through direct service purchase negotiations
  between industry and the supplier. The arm's length relationship created through this
  service delivery model has been very effective in ensuring that programme outputs are both
  reliable and perceived as reliable by all stakeholders.</p>
  <p>Certification is a prerequisite to working as an observer. Observer service providers
  hire, train and carryout certification examination for their observer candidates. Training
  generally takes three weeks to cover all aspects of the fishery, management and
  regulations, vessel operations and observer duties. In addition to meeting the training
  requirements, proficiency in at sea work must be met to retain certification. Recently,
  Canada has adopted national standards for observer training, certification, and code of
  conduct, providing more consistency between observers working on different programmes or
  regions (CGSB, 1997). </p>

<h2><a NAME="P983_123653"></a><b>6 OVERVIEW OF CANADIAN PROGRAMMES</b></h2>

<ul>
  <p>Canadian observer programmes began with the introduction of the 200 N.M. EEZ in 1977,
  as a measure by DFO to monitor activities of foreign fishing vessels while conducting
  operations within Canada's jurisdiction. As domestic fishing fleets expanded in capacity
  following the introduction of the EEZ, observer programmes were also introduced to these
  fleets and now have become part of the total management scheme for all major fisheries.
  Overall a corps of about 250 observers provides about 22,000 days of at sea monitoring per
  year within Canada.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P990_124233"></a><b>6.1 Atlantic region of Canada</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>In the Atlantic Region of Canada there are four separate observer programmes for each
  of DFO's administrative regions (Maritimes, Gulf, Newfoundland, and Laurentian). Close
  co-ordination between programmes is necessary as many fisheries and fleets span more than
  one region, resulting in observers from different Atlantic regions potentially
  contributing toward the monitoring of the same fishery. As a whole, the four observer
  programmes deploy about 180 observers for a total of 15,000 days per annum. </p>
  <p>Atlantic Canada's large continental shelf area supports annual fish harvests of over
  650,000 t (1996), principally shellfish (41%), pelagic fish species (39%), and groundfish
  (18%). Observer programmes play an important role in the management of these fisheries,
  ensuring their compliance with fisheries regulations and gathering vital fishery
  information that can not otherwise be obtained from fishing logbooks or shore-side landing
  inspections. The objectives of observer monitoring may vary by fishery but, in general,
  they are to monitor compliance with regulations (closed areas, small fish protocols, gear
  restrictions, high-grading, landing and reporting requirements) and gather data for stock
  assessment and to provide input into opening and closing fisheries.</p>
  <p>Coverage levels for domestic fisheries are variable and usually between 5% and 20%. The
  northern shrimp fishery, which involves a fleet of 17 large catcher/processor vessels,
  operates with 100% observer coverage as do the majority of experimental fisheries and
  foreign vessels conducting fishing operations within the Canadian EEZ. </p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P1001_125868"></a><b>6.2 North Atlantic Fishery Organisation (NAFO)</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>The North Atlantic Fishery Organisation (NAFO) Regulatory Area has been of interest to
  Canada because of potential impacts on fisheries within Canada's EEZ. Since 1996, NAFO
  Conservation and Enforcement Measures require observer monitoring of all NAFO
  member-nation vessels conducting fishing activities within the NAFO Regulatory Area. As a
  number of NAFO member countries did not have observer programmes when this regulation was
  implemented, Canada stepped forward to provide both funding and observers (through the
  Atlantic region's observer service contractors) to ensure the 100% coverage requirement
  was being met. The Canadian government also provided funds for training programmes, course
  curricula and other resource materials to assist the countries involved in developing
  their own observer service capability. Through these efforts, Canada supported about 3,800
  observer coverage days in the NAFO region out of a total of approximately 12,000 observed
  days in 1997.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P1008_126891"></a><b>6.3 Pacific region of British Columbia</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>Within the Pacific Region of British Columbia, there are two main observed fisheries:
  the domestic groundfish trawl fishery and a foreign joint-venture trawl fishery that
  targets Pacific hake (also known as Pacific whiting). Observer monitoring occurs on a more
  limited basis in a variety of other fisheries including salmon (all gear types), shrimp
  trawl, groundfish hook and line fisheries, herring spawn-on-kelp, and experimental
  fisheries. In total, Pacific region observer programmes involve about 75 observers
  providing 6,000 data collection days per year.</p>
  <p>Pacific Region ministerial policy raised compulsory observer coverage levels for the
  domestic groundfish trawl fleet to 100% in 1996. This decision recognised the critical
  need for providing of observers' independent, at-sea estimates for the management of the
  Individual Vessel Quota (IVQ) system, which was to be implemented in 1997. The fleet of 75
  vessels fishes year round throughout offshore British Columbia with total landings of over
  50,000 t. Over 80 fish species are captured in this fishery, and 22 of these are managed
  by area specific quotas. Thus, management of the fishery relies on accurate accounting of
  catch (including discards) for 55 different species-area quota units. Halibut bycatch and
  discards of unwanted fish are also significant management issues in this fishery. Bycatch
  rates are highly variable, with 10% of the total fishing operations accounting for nearly
  half the total quantities discarded and, conversely, nearly half the fishing operations
  result in about 10% of the total discarded catch. Thus, observer monitoring provides
  individual accountability for the fishing vessels, benefiting those with low bycatch rates
  and penalising those that catch and discard large quantities of unwanted fish.</p>
  <p>Observers monitor all fishing operations at sea and all dockside-offloading operations
  to obtain accurate weights by species of landed fish. During a typical year, there are
  about 900 fishing trips or about 5,500 observed fishing days constituting approximately
  20,000 trawl fishing sets. Fishery management utilises data collected at sea and dockside.
  The database updated upon the completion of each trip, in order to monitor overall catch
  and the quota holdings of each fishery participant. Biological sampling by dockside and
  at-sea observers meets an increasing amount of the scientific information needs for the
  stocks concerned. </p>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="P1018_129360"></a><b>7 SAMPLING AND DATA QUALITY</b></h2>

<ul>
  <p>In considering sampling and data quality, we first evaluate the factors which affect
  the accuracy of data collected by observers; these range from broad concerns regarding
  programme structure and appropriateness of objectives to more specific issues related to
  the difficulties associated with sampling on board commercial vessels, observer skill and
  experience, and the effects of inclement weather. Following the discussion of accuracy,
  some insights on sampling design are presented which demonstrate the extent to which
  sampling intensity influences precision when estimating catches of target and bycatch
  species.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P1025_130004"></a><b>7.1 Factors influencing the accuracy of data collected
by observers</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>Observer sampling is a three-stage process (V�lstad <i>et al</i>. 1997). The
  between-vessel level defines the proportion of the fleet observed, the within-vessel level
  is the proportion of hauls or sets within a vessel sampled by the observer, and the
  within-haul level concerns the selection of samples from individual catches.</p>
  <p>Random selection of vessels is difficult and often impossible to achieve and is of
  concern only when coverage levels are less than 100%. When an observer programme works
  with a small, homogenous fleet that is not greatly dispersed in space and time, it may be
  possible for the programme manager to maintain familiarity with the activities of all
  participating vessels, and allocate observer coverage in a random manner. If vessel
  operators lack the incentive, however, to carry observers, they can readily subvert plans
  for random placement. Many programmes cover a diverse fleet that is spatially and
  temporally dispersed. In such situations, it is virtually impossible to track fleet
  operations and ensure the random placement of observers. Assumptions that the catch
  characteristics of observed and unobserved vessels within the same fleet are comparable
  may be difficult to support, particularly if compliance issues are involved.</p>
  <p>Random selection of hauls or sets within a vessel is generally easier to achieve. In
  some cases, it may be possible for observers to sample all hauls or sets while aboard
  their vessels. In other cases, standard random sampling methodologies can be applied for
  selecting which hauls or sets will be sampled. </p>
  <p>In some situations, it may be possible to select random samples of catch within a haul,
  or time intervals during the retrieval of a longline. An observer's ability to sample
  accurately, however, is influenced by many factors. These include: objectives and
  expectations, working conditions, sampling methods, and observer qualities. Because
  observer programmes are often designed to address multiple objectives and provide
  information to a range of clients, the integrity of their operation is of paramount
  concern. However, when reliable information is available from a fishery, different
  stakeholders, sometimes with opposing views, can focus on analysis and problem solving
  without becoming preoccupied with debates over the validity of the information.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P1038_132387"></a><b>7.2 Objectives and expectations</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>Observer programme objectives may be narrow or broad. While there is a tendency to
  place many and varied responsibilities on the shoulders of observers, there is a finite
  limit to the amount of work they can accomplish, and requirements for training and
  previous experience may be greater for programmes with more demanding and complex sampling
  requirements. On the other hand, a programme designed simply to document specific types of
  fishery encounters with marine mammals or seabirds may underutilise its potential if
  observers are directed only to events which occur very rarely. Furthermore, when
  interactions with endangered species are concerned, it may be particularly important to
  document normal fishing activities and catch characteristics so that scientists can be
  provided with data to help them understand the circumstances under which these rare events
  occur. </p>
  <p>Certain types of catch monitoring objectives can be addressed only by observer
  programmes. These include documentation of at-sea discards and high-grading, interactions
  with endangered or threatened species, collection of geo-referenced information on catch
  quantity, composition, and biological characteristics, and monitoring for compliance with
  certain types of fishery regulations (e.g. discard of oil and plastics, careful handling
  to reduce mortality of discards, vessel and haul specific bycatch rate limits), In other
  cases, observer data may be required to supplement or verify other sources of information
  such as for verification of logbook or catch reporting requirements, and monitoring for
  compliance with time, area, and/or gear restrictions. </p>
  <p>Most programmes are designed to support multiple objectives, and, for many managers and
  policymakers, observer programmes are particularly valuable because of their ability to
  meet information needs for science, management, and enforcement. This makes it
  particularly important for those who design and manage observer programmes to recognise
  resource limitations, the feasibility of each objective, and the need to establish clear
  and unambiguous data collection priorities for observers. They must also understand that
  it may be necessary to compromise certain observer sampling objectives in order to ensure
  that other objectives are satisfied. It is also important to guard against placing
  unrealistic demands on these programmes and, hence, on the observers themselves.
  Over-ambitious tasking can lead to frustration when observer programmes cost more and
  deliver less than expected. Examples of conflicts which may arise as a result of
  incompatible objectives or over-ambitious tasking of observers include: placing
  unrealistically high scientific sampling requirements on a programme designed primarily to
  meet catch accounting and compliance monitoring goals in individual quota fisheries, and
  placing increasing demands for enumerating rare or protected species that must be returned
  to the water quickly, on a programme designed to provide accurate, haul-specific catch
  estimates. In these, and other similar situations, problems can sometimes be resolved by
  working with observers, industry, and other interested parties so that compromises can be
  reached without undermining the value of the data collected.</p>
  <p>In addition to the need for identifying and prioritising programme goals, there is also
  a need for periodic reviews and adjustments to programme sampling designs and priorities
  which may also involve various stakeholders. Objectives and data collection priorities,
  however, are sometimes unduly influenced by political and economic considerations and
  under these circumstances conflicts may arise in the establishment of programme objectives
  or priorities. As a result, participants may fail to support the basic requirement for
  establishing programmes with achievable goals, and basic programme requirements, such as
  the need to provide observers with reasonable remuneration and suitable working
  conditions, may be compromised. Consequently, programme managers may find it difficult to
  maintain standards that encourage observer professionalism, and programme integrity may
  suffer. Evaluation of the overall performance of a programme should include review of its
  ability to respond to observer needs such as wages, resources, communication, programme
  involvement, safety and support. </p>
</ul>

<h4><b><i>7.2.1 Enforcement objectives</i></b></h4>

<ul>
  <p>Observer programmes are being used increasingly to monitor for compliance with fishery
  regulations. The deterrent effect of observers for most fisheries is a direct function of
  the coverage level. While there may be marginal compliance control value with low coverage
  level fisheries, high coverage levels are generally required to support this function.
  Because the presence of observers directly influences crew behaviour in these types of
  situations (and is intended to do so), data obtained from the observed portion of the
  fleet should not be used to make inferences regarding the unobserved portion.</p>
  <p>In Canadian programmes, observers are directed to point out compliance concerns, giving
  fishers the opportunity to correct problems. This approach has resulted in more
  enforcement concerns being settled at sea, but with increased crew pressure on observers,
  particularly when the data they are collecting affects fishing or economic opportunity.</p>
  <p>Observer-related cases are often difficult and time consuming to prosecute, and may be
  further complicated by the fact that, because there is a high turnover rate in some
  programmes, it may be hard to locate the observer once a case goes to court. The
  credibility of observer data is often an issue during the enforcement process, and defence
  lawyers may attempt to cast doubt on an observers' professionalism during prosecutions.
  Observer programmes that employ standardised protocols for recording and handling
  compliance related issues are, therefore, more successful in providing admissible
  evidence. Given these challenges, it is important for programmes to develop mechanisms to
  support and protect observers so that they can carry out their duties and, when necessary,
  be available to act as witnesses. </p>
  <p>Observers may be reluctant to collect compliance-related data, particularly if they
  feel agency and contractor support is lacking. While fisheries enforcement personnel
  should prioritise actions to protect observers from interference or harassment, the
  personnel involved may have little understanding of observer responsibilities or the
  programme objectives. Observers may be reluctant to report compliance problems if they are
  unsure of the support which enforcement officials will provide. Programmes which allow
  fishing companies to negotiate freely with observer contractors may not be conducive to
  effective compliance monitoring by observers because fishing companies are free to
  terminate their association with a contractor and take their business to another
  &quot;more co-operative&quot; contractor if they feel it necessary.</p>
</ul>

<h4><b><i>7.2.2 Industry objectives</i></b></h4>

<ul>
  <p>Fishing industry groups have a vested interest in ensuring that independent, verifiable
  information is used to characterise fishing operations and evaluate the condition of the
  stocks. Under these circumstances, they can defend themselves against criticism from other
  industry groups and environmental organisations. Thus, from the industry's point of view,
  programmes must not only meet their objectives but must also be perceived by all clients
  to meet their objectives. Observer programmes often provide data to the fishing industry.
  This has, in some cases, supported activities directed at improving fishing gear and
  fishing strategies, increasing catch rates, decreasing bycatch, and developing new
  fisheries. These activities all tend to foster industry support of observer programmes.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P1063_140186"></a><b>7.3 Programme structure</b></h3>

<h4><b><i>7.3.1 Service delivery</i></b></h4>

<ul>
  <p>The overall programme structure and service delivery model plays a significant part in
  creating an environment for observer professionalism and hence, providing high quality
  data. Historically, agencies have preferred to maintain in-house observer programmes with
  all functions being carried out by government personnel. In recent years, however,
  agencies have been under pressure to reduce employment levels and recover programme costs
  from industry. As a result, private sector participation in observer programmes has
  increased and this has provided increased flexibility with regards to meeting the often
  substantial observer programme labour requirements, work seasonality, and accommodating
  systems which allow for cost recovery from the fishing industry.</p>
</ul>

<h4><b><i>7.3.2 Programme responsibilities</i></b></h4>

<ul>
  <p>Observer programme managers are challenged with designing strategies to create an
  employment environment that attracts and retains high quality observers. Elements that
  contribute towards the development of professional staff include;</p>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><b>Fair compensation</b>. Observers should be remunerated at a level which is consistent
    with the challenges they face collecting the data, and the importance of their
    observations to the conservation and management of the stocks. They are often deployed at
    very short notice and may be required to complete lengthy assignments. Isolation, long
    work hours and the sometimes unfriendly work environment add to the stresses they must
    endure. There is no standard approach to establishing observer salary, but problems may
    arise when observer pay levels are markedly lower than those provided to government
    employees who conduct similar work, or vessel crew;</li>
  <li><b>Resources</b>. Observers appreciate having the right tools for their work and
    performance improves when they have the resources appropriate for carrying out their work.
    Instruction manuals that clearly explain the work requirements; data sheets that are well
    designed; reference materials that are up to date and informative; and sampling equipment
    that is in good repair and appropriate to the work requirement are all important. Adequate
    working space and access to the catch should also be of concern; this requirement may be
    addressed through regulation or industry outreach;</li>
  <li><b>Monitoring observer concerns and work attitude</b>. Because observer programmes are
    generally de-centralised, communications can be difficult. However, interaction with
    observers in the field is critical to the success of any programme, and steps should be
    taken to provide the resources necessary to meet this requirement. In some situations,
    electronic communication systems allow programmes to monitor observer performance on an
    ongoing basis, otherwise, monitoring of observer performance in the field can be
    accomplished through use of field personnel, telephone interviews, and other means.
    Debriefing is an important function of most observer programmes which provides a mechanism
    for identifying and resolving data collection problems and making any necessary
    corrections;</li>
  <li><b>Involvement in programme design and evaluation.</b> Observer programme staff may not
    always interact with the groups involved with programme design or data use on a regular
    basis. It is very beneficial for programme staff, including observers, to understand the
    intended uses of observer data and to be involved with development of sampling protocols.
    In gaining a broader understanding of how the data are used, observers gain a greater
    appreciation for the value of their work. Likewise, users of observer data who regularly
    interact with observers and programme staff gain a broader understanding of the fishery
    and the limitations of the data. Furthermore, observer work often improves when observers
    understand the uses to which their data will be put. This information can be provided
    during training if trainers are familiar with the scientists, managers, and enforcement
    officials who depend on their data;</li>
  <li><b>Observer Support.</b> While programme managers have little direct control of the work
    setting, observers depend upon their employers to respond when serious issues arise. In
    pursuing their work responsibilities, observers may experience various forms of harassment
    including sampling interference, sexual harassment, verbal or psychological abuse, or
    assault. Programme managers must provide observers and industry personnel with a clear and
    unambiguous policy on observer interference and harassment and have the authority,
    resources, and determination to take all necessary actions when such problems arise.
    Observer mistreatment is less likely to occur when guidelines are clear and the response
    to incidents is timely and appropriate, and</li>
  <li><b>Safety.</b> Observer programmes must provide an environment that ensures the highest
    standards of safety for observers. Observer safety is an important but complex issue as
    vessel safety relates to both compliance with safety regulations and the manner in which
    the vessel is operated. Programmes need to empower observers to make the final assessment
    on safety and support their decisions. Programme managers must also ensure that observers
    are supplied with the necessary safety equipment for their work assignment and that they
    are trained in safety procedures. Fishing industry participants share the responsibility
    for providing a safe working environment for observers.</li>
</ol>

<h4><b><i>7.3.3 Agency responsibilities</i></b></h4>

<ul>
  <p>Regardless of whether service delivery is provided in-house (by government employees)
  or by private sector contractors, government retains the responsibilities for setting the
  rules under which an observer programmes exist. This may be accomplished by statute,
  regulation, and/or policy. Through this process, broad goals and objectives should be
  established, and requirements for service providers, fishing industry, and observer
  participants defined. Supplementary regulations and/or policies may implement management
  programmes which depend on monitoring by observers. Through these regulatory processes,
  agencies have an obligation to ensure that expectations are realistic and resources are
  adequate. They must also regulate to address issues regarding data collection integrity,
  safety, and suitable working conditions for observers. When compliance monitoring
  responsibilities are involved, or sampling interference and observer harassment are
  expected to occur, agencies are obliged to provide enforcement resources to back up
  observers and to ensure that the consequences of interference and harassment are
  appropriate. </p>
  <p>Even when observer services are provided by contractors, it is generally preferable for
  agencies to retain responsibilities for such functions as training, certification,
  decertification, long-term data management and analysis. If all observer programme
  functions are contracted, agencies run the risk of losing programme functionality when a
  change in contractors occurs. This can be prevented by maintaining responsibilities for
  oversight and certain programme functions. </p>
  <p>In some cases, the need to recover costs from the fishing industry results in the
  implementation of programmes with service delivery models under which fishing companies
  pay observer contractors directly for supplying observer services. This direct working
  relationship between contractors and industry may compromise government control and
  flexibility in placing observers, setting coverage levels, and designing sampling
  protocols. Furthermore, serious concerns about conflict of interest arise when companies
  compete for industry clients without government involvement and this process may erode
  confidence in the integrity of the data. Systems of this type also complicate and perhaps
  compromise government responsibilities for directing the placement of observers and
  holding contractors responsible for the quality of work performed by their employees. </p>
</ul>

<h4><b><i>7.3.4 Fishing industry responsibilities</i></b></h4>

<ul>
  <p>The fishing industry is directly involved in the process of catch monitoring and must
  play a substantial role in the design and implementation of observer programmes if they
  are to be effective. Fishing companies are responsible for establishing a safe, effective,
  and respectful working environment for observers and assuring that crew co-operate with
  observers when appropriate. Unfortunately, certain types of data collection objectives may
  provide incentives for crewmembers to be unappreciative, suspicious, or even hostile.
  Under such circumstances, fishing companies and observer programmes must work together on
  creative solutions. Some programmes conduct observer placement orientations in order to
  familiarise skippers and crewmembers with observer duties, sampling protocols, and crew
  assistance requirements. Education and outreach efforts are more likely to succeed if
  there is a positive incentive for industry to co-operate. Noteworthy instances of
  co-operation have stemmed from working directly with fishermen and including them in
  research programmes. </p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P1095_149187"></a><b>7.4 Working conditions </b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>The nature of the work setting aboard fishing vessels has a significant influence on
  the quality of information obtainable by observers. Fishing vessel design and operations
  are tailored to the efficient capture and handling of fish and involve processes which may
  not be conducive to data collection by observers. Very often, catch determination is a
  primary goal of observer programmes and observers direct the majority of their work time
  to catch monitoring tasks including estimating catch quantity and species composition,
  determining quantities of retained and discarded fish, and, in some instances, determining
  the viability of discards. Observers face a number of challenges in gathering this
  information; these may be caused by:</p>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><b>Fishing methods</b>. The fishing method used will strongly influence the observer's
    ability to estimate catch. Gears such as long-lines and traps bring fish aboard
    incrementally and, though catch may be easy to identify and count, gear retrieval may
    occur over long time periods. In these instances, observers usually select random time
    intervals during which to enumerate catch. In contrast, trawls and seines bring (often
    large) catches aboard instantaneously causing sampling difficulties which may be
    considerable. In these instances observers may find it difficult to take random samples of
    adequate size from the catch;</li>
  <li><b>Catch size and composition</b>. The quality of catch estimates obtained by observers
    is influenced by the quantity and diversity of species in the catch. In many fisheries,
    catches may be large enough to create sampling problems for observers. Even when species
    diversity is low, thorough determination of catch composition may be difficult, especially
    in pelagic trawl fisheries were catches can be high (&gt; 100 t) and the incidence of
    important bycatch species low (&lt;&lt; 1%);</li>
  <li><b>Catch handling methods</b>. Fishing vessels vary in the layout and amount of deck or
    factory space for catch handling and this influences the way that catch is transferred
    aboard, sorted and processed. Observer sampling opportunities and methods are governed by
    access to monitoring control points and the amount of time and space available for sample
    collection and processing. There may be no single control point from which to enumerate
    all aspects of the catch in a similar fashion. For example, primary culling of discarded
    catch may occur on the trawl deck and final sorting on conveyers. In addition, when catch
    is brought on board, observers must work around a number of activities. Crew members may
    be busy stowing or preparing gear for re-setting, culling and removing unwanted catch, and
    processing or storing fish in holds. Observers must overcome these challenges when
    deciding how and where to allocate their sampling efforts, and they may need to employ
    suboptimal sampling methods when their needs conflict with others on the vessel, or when
    safety concerns arise;</li>
  <li><b>Crew co-operation</b>. Crew co-operation is essential to the success of most observer
    sampling activities. This subject is discussed at greater length in the preceding section
    on industry responsibilities, and</li>
  <li><b>Weather</b>. Weather encountered during the trip may force the vessel to modify their
    original fishing plan, or minimise work activities. In these circumstances, ambitious
    sampling designs may be reduced to visual estimates made from the safety of cover. </li>
</ol>

<h3><a NAME="P1108_152580"></a><b>7.5 Sampling methods</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>Basic observer sampling generally involves two major tasks: estimation of catch
  quantity, and collection of data for determination of catch composition. The most common
  include: visual estimation, basket sampling, counts applied to average weights,
  volume-density estimates, and whole haul catch enumeration. Even though visual estimation
  of catch quantity is discouraged due to the uncertainty and reliance on observer
  experience, it may, in some circumstances, be the only method available. Since weighing of
  catch at sea occurs in only a few fisheries, many programmes obtain catch weights by
  applying density coefficients to catch volume estimates. Several factors influence
  density, including the morphology of the species involved and the extent to which fish are
  compacted; since these factors may be difficult to take into account when obtaining
  density estimates, inaccuracies in catch quantity determination may arise (Dorn <i>et al.</i>
  1997a). Most observer programmes strive to provide observers with a `tool kit' of sampling
  methods and guidance on practical approaches to use in particular circumstances. Programme
  managers depend upon observers to evaluate the overall circumstances of the work setting
  and employ the best methods for the particular situation.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a NAME="P1115_153868"></a><b>7.6 Observer qualities</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>The success of an observer programme is highly dependent on the qualities and strengths
  that the individual observers bring to it. Fishery observers are faced with unique
  challenges because their work occurs in remote, hostile locations, and sampling problems
  are often difficult to resolve. Nevertheless, many programmes have been successful because
  they have attracted high quality individuals and provided incentives for them to remain in
  the job. In contrast to a more centralised work setting, such as an office or factory or
  even a research vessel, where workers have regular and frequent supervisor contact,
  observer programmes are highly decentralised. Observers are isolated from each other and
  their supervisors and do not generally have the opportunity to seek advice when unique
  situations arise. Programme staff are generally unable to evaluate the observer
  methodologies and data until after the assignment has been completed. Since it may be
  difficult or impossible to monitor and correct problems during a trip, it becomes very
  important for managers to find ways to ensure that observer information is collected
  properly. Development and maintenance of a professional observer staff is, therefore,
  critical to the success of a programme and to the production of high quality data. The
  qualities which professional observers bring to a programme include:</p>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li><b>Experience</b>. Experience develops with time spent at sea in a diverse range of
    sampling situations. Through this process, individuals learn to meet programme sampling
    objectives in a practical manner, and co-ordinate their activities with those of vessel
    personnel. Experience (and maturity) also allows observers to enhance their abilities to
    approach sensitive issues in a respectful manner;</li>
  <li><b>Knowledge</b>. Core training for observers covers all aspects of the fishery,
    management and regulations, vessel operations, fishery biology, and observer duties. Other
    knowledge, gained through practical work experience aboard fishing vessels, includes
    working and living aboard fishing vessels, and fishery issues from the perspective of the
    fishers. Once they have received basic training, many programmes require their observers
    to attend periodic briefings to refresh and update their skills. The degree of experience
    and training required of observers will depend, largely, on the specific data collection
    responsibilities of the programme. Training should be reviewed frequently to ensure that
    observers are properly prepared, and new objectives should only be incorporated in a
    programme when it is clear that training and observer skill levels are appropriate;</li>
  <li><b>Integrity</b>. In their role as data collectors, observers collect and document
    confidential information on fishing activities that may be critical to the business
    operations of the companies involved. In programmes that address management needs,
    observer-provided information directly affects fishing or economic opportunities for the
    fishing vessels and their crews. It is critical that observers report information honestly
    and be respectful of the importance and confidentiality of the data they collect, and</li>
  <li><b>Motivation</b>. Since they cannot supervise observers directly, programme managers
    rely on the initiative of their observers to complete the work requirements properly.
    Observer motivation and commitment to the job is essential when observers are faced with
    such challenges as poor weather, uncomfortable working conditions, repetitious sampling
    duties, and potentially hostile treatment.</li>

<h3><a NAME="P1127_157415"></a><b>7.7 Coverage levels and estimation uncertainty</b></h3>

<ul>
  <p>Uncertainty associated with catch and bycatch estimates should be of concern to
  scientists responsible for stock assessments. However, catch estimation methodology does
  not always lend itself to the estimation of associated variances, and stock assessment
  methodologies generally consider catch information in a deterministic manner. In the
  Alaska groundfish fisheries, quota monitoring and, hence mortality estimation, is
  accomplished through an <i>ad hoc</i> process which uses observer data in some cases,
  industry reports in other cases, and stratifies according to the quantity and quality of
  data available in each temporal, spatial, gear type, and target fishery or bycatch
  category. Thus, it is difficult to link coverage levels directly with the information
  needs for the various objectives of the programme.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, since a substantial portion of the Alaska groundfish fishery is subject
  to 100% observer coverage, it is possible to develop catch and bycatch estimators with
  associated measures of uncertainty. A number of such studies have been carried out by NMFS
  at the Alaska Fisheries Science Centre, and they provide useful insights regarding
  coverage levels required to address different types of catch information requirements. </p>
  <p>Dorn <i>et al.</i> (1997b) calculated the percent error (defined as: upper percent
  error = ((upper bound of the 95% confidence interval/estimate)-1) x 100, lower percent
  error = ((lower bound of the 95% confidence interval/estimate)-1) x 100) associated with
  estimates of catch and bycatch based on observer data in several target fisheries,
  although they considered only the variability associated with the proportion of vessels
  observed in a given fleet. Their analyses indicate that low levels of observer coverage
  are associated with relatively high levels of error for most target and non-target species
  (Fig. 1). For target species and some non-target species, error decreases rapidly as
  coverage increases from 10% to 30% and much more slowly under further coverage increases.
  For some bycatch species, however, uncertainty remains high, even when all vessels are
  observed. </p>
  <p>V�lstad <i>et al.</i> (1997) conducted a detailed analysis of sampling and catch
  estimation in the (100% observed) trawl catcher-processor fisheries for walleye pollock
  and yellowfin sole in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands region. They developed a methodology
  for estimating catch and bycatch exclusively from observer data and provided associated
  measures of uncertainty. They also examined the trade-offs between uncertainty and the
  proportion of vessels in the fleet observed, and the proportion of hauls sampled by
  observers. In common with Dorn <i>et al.</i> (1997b), they did not consider uncertainty
  associated with within-haul sampling because appropriate data were not available. Also in
  common with Dorn <i>et al.</i> (1997b), they determined that the error associated with
  fleetwide estimates of target catch in these 100% observed fisheries was low, but that
  estimation uncertainty decreased for some of the major bycatch species, such as Pacific
  cod and rock sole (in the pollock target fishery), and much more so for the rarely
  occurring prohibited species, Pacific salmon and Pacific herring. The simulations they
  performed indicated that variability is high when either the fraction of vessels sampled
  within the fleet or the fraction of hauls sampled within a vessel is low. If random
  selection of vessels were possible, and the observer effect was not of concern, estimates
  of the catch of frequently occurring species with acceptable error bounds could be made by
  sampling approximately 30% of the vessels. For less frequently occurring species, a much
  larger proportion of the fleet would need to be sampled. Once aboard a vessel, observers
  generally sample 60-70% of the hauls, so the within vessel sampling fraction is generally
  not of concern. Examination of the results for bycatch of chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus
  tshawytscha</i>) (Fig. 2) indicates the extent to which the precision of the overall
  chinook bycatch estimate is sensitive to the number of vessels observed and the fraction
  of hauls sampled within vessels, and that variability is much higher on some vessels than
  on others. </p>
  <p>Even though salmon bycatch rates are very low in the pollock fisheries (substantially
  lower than 100,000 salmon in a total annual pollock harvest in excess of 1.0 million t in
  most years), certain highly productive pollock fishing areas may be closed when salmon
  bycatch limits are exceeded. The accuracy and precision requirements for salmon bycatch
  estimates, therefore, are high, but influenced by substantial sampling constraints. Since
  the work reported above considered only uncertainty associated with the between and within
  vessel sampling activities, Turnock and Karp (1997) conducted simulations to investigate
  uncertainty associated with the third sampling stage, the within haul level. Within haul
  sampling variability is of considerable concern when estimating bycatch of rarely
  occurring species which are likely to be highly aggregated. Since information on the
  within haul distribution is unknown, they made the simplifying assumption of a Poisson
  random distribution and simulated the sampling process to provide a basis for determining
  variability associated with each sampling stage. Because salmon bycatch may be limiting,
  and considerable between vessel differences are apparent, industry members are
  particularly keen to hold each fishing company responsible for its vessels' bycatch and
  fishing companies are keen to pass this responsibility on to their captains and crew.
  Consequently, managers are asked to provide vessel-specific salmon bycatch information,
  and they look to the observer programme for the necessary data. Recognising this need,
  Turnock and Karp (1997) paid particular attention to the sampling requirements for vessel
  specific sampling salmon bycatch determination. Their results suggest that variability
  decreases rapidly with increasing sampling intensity until the within haul sampling
  fraction approaches 20-30%, and that variability also remains high until 50-70% of the
  hauls are sampled (Fig. 3).</p>

</blockquote>

<ul>
  <p>Fortunately, observers are generally able to sample 60-70% of the hauls taken by their
  vessels in the pollock fishery. Unfortunately, however, individual hauls often exceed 100
  t, so the likelihood of sampling between 20% and 30% of the catch is small. Furthermore,
  the distribution of salmon in the catches is almost certainly more complex than was
  assumed during this analysis and, consequently, within-haul variability is likely to be
  much greater than predicted. Even though policy makers and managers may prefer individual
  vessel accountability for salmon bycatch in the pollock fisheries, practical limitations
  may preclude this possibility.</p>

<h2><a NAME="P1157_165362"></a><b>8 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</b></h2>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Observer programmes provide the only means for collecting certain types of data required
      for determining the status of our living marine resources and determining the consequences
      of commercial fishery operations. Furthermore, they are an essential component of an
      integrated fisheries monitoring system;</li>
    <li>Since they are generally expensive and complex, great care should be taken when
      designing observer programmes to ensure that the goals and objectives are clear and
      unambiguous, and that they are achievable. Managers and scientists who depend on observer
      data must recognise the uncertainties involved, and place demands on programmes, which are
      consistent with these uncertainties. They must also recognise the consequences of placing
      conflicting demands on their observer programmes;</li>
    <li>To properly serve the needs of industry and government clients, the integrity of
      observer programmes should be carefully protected. This can be accomplished by ensuring
      that the service delivery model is free from conflict of interest, which is the case when
      observers are employed directly by government agencies or by contractors who are
      accountable directly to government agencies;</li>
    <li>Industry participation in the setting of programme goals and priorities should be
      encouraged, but should be protected from political influences which might result in
      placing unrealistic expectations on a programme. While industry co-operation is essential
      to successful programme operations, industry cannot be permitted to influence placement
      decisions made by programme managers. The benefits that industry obtains from observer
      programmes are greater when the public perceives that these programme are not subject to
      inappropriate industry influences;</li>
    <li>The conditions under which observers work are often harsh, and sampling requirements
      which are easy to achieve in a research environment may be impossible to achieve on a
      commercial vessel. While demands placed on observers must be realistic, the observers
      themselves must be provided with the tools necessary to carry out their duties. These
      include training and the provision of suitable sampling equipment, agency and contractor
      support, and maintenance of a safe, positive and productive working environment at sea;</li>
    <li>Observer experience and professionalism are essential to the success of any programme
      and steps should be taken to ensure that employment terms, working conditions, and all
      other aspects of programme design and implementation meet standards which will encourage
      individuals who perform well to observe on a continuing basis;</li>
    <li>The service delivery model employed by a programme may directly impact its ability to
      delivery high-quality, independent data. While certain programme functions should be
      retained by government agencies, provision of observer services by private companies who
      contract directly with government agencies is generally successful and cost effective.
      When fishing companies are permitted to negotiate directly with service providers,
      conflicts of interest may arise, and data integrity may be compromised. This concern is
      exacerbated when observers perform compliance monitoring duties;</li>
    <li>Agencies must retain sufficient expertise to allow them to transfer observer programmes
      to new contractors without interruption of service;</li>
    <li>When sampling interference or observer harassment occur, agencies are obliged to provide
      enforcement resources to back up observers and ensure that the consequences of this type
      behaviour are appropriate;</li>
    <li>Random placement of observers on vessels is generally difficult to achieve and when
      compliance concerns are involved it may not be reasonable to assume that the catch
      characteristics of observed and unobserved vessels are similar, and</li>
    <li>Even though it may be possible to select the hauls or sets to be sampled in a random
      fashion, requirements for random subsampling within a haul or set may also be difficult to
      meet. </li>
