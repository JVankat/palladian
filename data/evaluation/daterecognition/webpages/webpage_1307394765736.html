                <h2 class="sectiontitle">Artist in Focus:- Leon Jordan</h2>
               
                <div class='wysiwyg'><p>We talk to poet and artist Leon Jordan, Leon uses his art to challenge social attitudes towards people with learning disabilities.<br /><br /><strong>This interview is in his own words.</strong> <br /><br />1. <strong>Brief biography about me&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>My name is Leon Jordan. I am a poet and artist and I use my art to challenge social attitudes towards people with learning disabilities. I am a young man with learning disabilities who grew up and still lives in&nbsp;Wandsworth. Outside of my art practice I work part time as an Office Support Assistant in the Adult Social Services team of Wandsworth Council. <br /><br /><br /><strong>2. What are you working on at the moment?<br /><br /></strong>I&rsquo;m currently working on three areas of art: poetry, drawing and story writing. My next goal is to start putting work into exhibitions. I&rsquo;m currently working with light and dark themes &ndash;not only in the drawing, but throughout my writing too. I have many sources of inspiration &ndash;nature, social events, social attitudes. Yesterday a friend and I went to Richmond Park. It was a beautiful cloudless day &ndash;the sun was perfect &ndash; and because I&rsquo;m artistic I gathered so many ideas. <br /><br />I also attend an art group at Generate (a supported employment service based in Wandsworth), where I get the opportunity to develop my ideas.<br /><br /><img alt="Picture of Leon Johnson speaking at Articulate conference " src="http://www.shapearts.org.uk/images/cms/pictureofleonjohnsonspeakingatarticulateconference.jpg" /><br />3. <strong>What is a usual day for you?</strong> <br /><br />Well outside of the days that I work, I like to get out and about in order to gather inspiration for my art. I often jump on the bus up to South Kensington and wander around the museums. I normally do all of my art work away from home as&nbsp;it&rsquo;s&nbsp; best to get it down while the ideas are flowing and inspiration is right in front of me. I also attend weekly art classes at Generate which form an important part of the time I dedicate to being an artist.<br /><br /><br />4. <strong>What is your greatest achievement?<br /><br /></strong>I have two! The first is getting my job. The second is that I am proud of having a disability and use it as a positive rather than a negative influence in my life. <br /><br /><br /><strong>5. If you had the chance to go back in time what piece of artwork would you have produced and why?<br /><br /></strong>Any artwork that challenges people&rsquo;s attitudes, as that is what is most important about art.<br /><br /><br /><strong>6. What artist, art form or arts movement has especially influenced you and your work?<br /><br /></strong>My mum is the one who encouraged and supported me to be more artistic. My own experiences of disability have been the inspiration for the themes of my work. <br /><br /><br /><strong>7. Who is your hero?</strong></p>
<p>I have absolutely loads! In a nutshell: My mum, based on her love and support. Louie Spence based on his ability to use his art to inspire others, Leonardo Da Vinci and Paul Cezanne based on their contribution to the world of art.<br /><br /><strong>8.&nbsp; What is the biggest challenge as an artist today?<br /><br /></strong>Well I speak for myself when I say the biggest challenge is how to go about channelling all the ideas and inspiration I gather into pieces of art. My &lsquo;mixer theory&rsquo; explains it well. Imagine me opening my kitchen cupboard and, without any thought, I grab a number of random ingredients and put small amounts of each into a mixing bowl. I then let a food mixer do the work, before trying a small sample of my creation. This is artwork in itself but also works well as a metaphor for how I collate my ideas &ndash;I just mix my thoughts and feelings by trial and error to see what interesting new thoughts and feeling these create.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Art isn&rsquo;t about scissors and glue, it&rsquo;s about mixing things &ndash;combining things that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally think about as going together. This is the way that I produce my art.<br /><img alt="Picture of Leon Jordan" src="http://www.shapearts.org.uk/images/cms/pictureofleonjordan.jpg" /><br /><br /><strong>9. Do you think that the attitude towards working with disabled and deaf artists has changed over the last 10 years? <br /><br /><br /></strong>I&rsquo;m not sure about how it has changed over this period, but people&rsquo;s attitudes towards me as an artist have been really heartwarming. I receive a lot of respect and this in turn improves my confidence and helps me to produce more art. Disabled artists have an important platform from which they can educate and challenge society, and I make full use of that opportunity! <br /><br /><br /><strong>10. If you could invite any four people from the past or present to a dinner party whom would you have?<br /><br /></strong>Firstly, my mum. When I first found out I had a disability I was able to talk to my mum about my worries and fears, and she supported me through this totally so she is the most important person in my life. Secondly, Amelia Earhart because she always knew the direction in which she wanted to travel and didn&rsquo;t allow anything or anyone to stop her achieving her goals. Thirdly, Louie Spence because he is flamboyant, funny and artistic, and lastly, any one of my friends at Shape who have recognised my talent and allowed me to share it with them. <br /><br /><br /><strong>11. Is there any advice you would like to give to aspiring artists?</strong></p>
<p>Have a clear mind, set goals and trust your instincts. Also, collaborate with fate &ndash;it is not to be feared. I would also advise people to have faith in themselves and also in their artwork.<br /><br /><br /><strong>At the private view on Wednesday 16th February the <a href="http://www.shapearts.org.uk/news/newsdetail/index.asp?view=294">Uninterpreted</a></strong><a href="javascript:void(0);/*1302788626364*/"> </a><strong><a href="javascript:void(0);/*1302788626364*/">exhibition</a> was opened by the artist, Leon Jordan.&nbsp; In&nbsp;Leon's speech, he read out his beautiful poem called &quot;Pathways&quot;,&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.shapearts.org.uk/documents/Leon''s_poem.doc">click here to read Leon's poem </a></p></div>
