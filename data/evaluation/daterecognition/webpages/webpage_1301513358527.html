<p>The cops called him uncooperative.</p>
<p>But <strong>Joshua Radwan</strong> just wouldn’t shut up.</p>
<p>He kept asking <strong>Orange County sheriff’s</strong> <strong>deputies</strong> why they were searching him, then why they were hurting him. Finally, his questions turned to screams of pain.</p>

<p>His cries reverberated on a dark street in <strong>Laguna Niguel</strong> late <strong>Dec. 23, 2006</strong>, and off the walls of the <strong>Orange County Jail</strong> as the clock ticked into <strong>Christmas Eve</strong>.</p>
<p>Radwan, diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was handcuffed, placed in leg irons, smashed against the hood of a police car and shot with a Taser.</p>
<p>At the jail, his right shoulder was dislocated.</p>
<p>Radwan, nearly four years later, still wants to know why he was treated so forcefully. This time, he is asking his questions in <strong>federal court</strong>.</p>
<p>Radwan sued the county and <strong>six</strong> sheriff&#8217;s deputies, alleging excessive force and misrepresenting the facts to avoid discipline and civil action. The case is awaiting trial.</p>
<p>Sheriff’s officials declined comment on the case.</p>
<p>The department has been in the headlines several times lately for allegations of excessive force. In October, the county paid <a href="http://taxdollars.ocregister.com/2010/10/20/toy-white-victor-in-excessive-force-case-speaks-out/66530/">$449,400 </a>to Toy White, who was allegedly assaulted on her doorstep by deputies. And in May, the county agreed to pay <a href="http://taxdollars.ocregister.com/2010/05/06/county-pays-200000-in-video-taped-excessive-force-case/56663/">$200,000 </a>to a man who was tackled by a deputy while hugging his mother in the street. The county this year also paid <a href="http://taxdollars.ocregister.com/2010/04/29/former-inmate-gets-750000-in-use-of-force-settlement/56047/">$750,000 </a>to settle the suit of a man who was kneed in the head and shot with a stun gun while he was handcuffed in 2006.</p>
<p><span id="more-67844"></span></p>
<p>In the Radwan case, cameras mounted on the patrol cars that night, and carried by a deputy at the jail, caught the ordeal. The Watchdog has obtained the videos. All of the deputies carried belt microphones, but none were activated as required by policy.</p>
<p>What did Radwan do to deserve such treatment? Deputies wrote in their report that he pushed back with his body while being searched, and that he tensed his leg muscles while jailers tried to restrain him.</p>
<p>Radwan’s crime: possessing three ornamental knives in his SUV, in what deputies alleged was a violation of a court restraining order. The knives were gifts for his father, Radwan said. Deputies also found pepper spray and less than an ounce of marijuana.</p>
<p>Radwan says the deputies were mistaken in their interpretation of the restraining order, which only forbade him from carrying firearms. Radwan at the time was awaiting trial on charges of robbery, which were ultimately dismissed for lack of evidence. He pleaded guilty to possession of nunchakus, a martial arts weapon.</p>
<p>Radwan’s ordeal with deputies started about <strong>9:30 p.m</strong>. on <strong>December 23, 2006</strong>, at the corner of <strong>Paseo de</strong> <strong>Colinas</strong> and <strong>Golden Lantern</strong>. According to his lawsuit, Radwan and his girlfriend, <strong>Cassandra Fults</strong>, were arguing after a day of<strong> Christmas</strong> shopping.</p>
<p>Radwan, in an interview, said he kicked a tire on his <strong>Range Rover</strong>. A passerby saw the animated Radwan and called police. Deputies arrived, talked with Radwan and searched him. They placed him in a patrol car and searched his SUV, sifting through gifts. At one point deputies can be seen on video toying with two “Star Wars”-type light sabers they found.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve Deputy Mark Hergesheimer</strong> is called to transport Radwan to the jail, but he gets lost en route to the scene. At one point, the microphone in the patrol car catches Hergesheimer saying, “God, I’m getting pissed now,” after making one of several U-turns.</p>
<p>Finally arriving at the scene, Hergesheimer can be heard on the video responding, “I’ll get him good,” after being told that Radwan had already been searched. This time, Radwan’s face was bashed into the hood of a patrol car, causing his glasses to cut the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>When he protested, he was taken off camera and hit with a Taser, although he was already bound. In 2009, the hazards of electronic control devices prompted the Sheriff’s Department to amend its policy, prohibiting their use on handcuffed individuals, absent overly assaultive behavior.</p>
<p>On the way to the jail, Hergesheimer radioed that he had an &#8220;uncooperative.&#8221; Radwan insisted from the back seat of the squad car that he was cooperative.  A group of deputies in latex gloves were already waiting to escort Radwan when the patrol car pulled into the jail.</p>
<p>Deputies pulled Radwan out of the car as he screamed that he could not walk because the cuffs were tearing into his ankles. Deputies picked him up by his leg chains and carried him into the jail. At one point, a jailer stepped on the leg chains, causing the cuffs to bite further into his skin.</p>
<p>In a medical exam room, Joshua screamed while his body was contorted by deputies as they removed his cuffs and stripped off his outer garments. His shoulder was dislocated, Radwan says, preventing him from responding to a nurse’s questions.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, based on sheriff’s reports, charged Radwan with resisting police officers, but the charges were later dismissed.</p>
<p>Radwan, now 29, says he’s not suing the deputies for money. The entrepreneur, who comes from a wealthy family, is involved in a variety of businesses that allow him to live comfortably.</p>
<p>“I made the decision to bring a lawsuit against these deputies while they were using their Taser on me,” Radwan said. “They arrested me for something I did not do, handcuffed me, put leg irons on me, smashed my head into one of the cars and then used their Taser on me and then lied to cover their bad deeds, claiming that I resisted arrest when all I did was verbally protest their abuse of me.”</p>
<p>Radwan said the cameras in the patrol cars back his claims that he was mistreated.</p>
<p>He questioned why deputies at the scene did not have their belt microphones activated as required.</p>
<p>“The taxpayers of Orange County would be spared a lot of money from lawsuits against deputy sheriffs if the microphone requirement was enforced,” Radwan said.</p>
<p>If a jury finds in his favor, Radwan said any money awarded to him will be designated for a “mental health campus” to be established in Orange County for the public to learn about people with mental illnesses and for the mentally ill to go when they need help.</p>

		<p>I couldn&#8217;t even watch the whole video, it made me cringe! This is absolutely disgusting! Those officers (if we can call them that) should be ashamed of themselves, the Orange County sheriff’s deputies and department should be ashamed of themselves! This department needs to be looked into! There should be a full blown investigations, on the department and these officers! This is so disturbing!!!! </p>
<p>Watching the video, the kid cooperated from the start (yes he back talked a little) however the force that is being used here &#8211; Slamming his face on the hood of the car, the tossing of him to the ground as they are getting him out of the car &#8220;DISGUSTING&#8221;, the tightness of the cuffs &#8220;DISGUSTING&#8221; the knees on his back, with excessive force and the dislocation on his arm <img src='http://taxdollars.ocregister.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> ISGUSTING&#8221;&#8230;. as well as the few snickers and comments coming from the officers is &#8220;DISGUSTING&#8221;.. You would think they would have learned by now that everything is VIDEO taped! Over and above the fact that, that I question the  &#8230; coincidence that when they are filming someone, they never seem to film officers faces? </p>
<p>Personally I would sue the &#8220;CRAP&#8221; (lack of a different word) out of the department and each individual officer! I would sue for ABUSE, first and foremost, secondly, I would sue pain and suffering, harassment, emotional distress, mental anguish, damages, and anything else I could sue for. THIS IS SO OVER THE TOP and crosses the line. These officers are no better then a bunch of THUGS on the streets! </p>
<p>* I can only hope that someone from the Department reads these comments over here&#8230;&#8230; and they learn something and the way most of the public feels about them&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. WHAT a JOKE the deputies and the department has become!!!!!!!!! You&#8217;re reputation is no longer and hasn&#8217;t been what it was in the past. It&#8217;s SHADY!!</p>

<p>I remember reading that story&#8230;&#8230; ugh.. That poor family to have to deal with something like that. I am glad they got the money &#8211; how scary!</p>

		<p>where you there? No, you weren&#8217;t.  And until you are in their shoes (you would never be because I can tell what a pussy you are&#8230;) Do not act like you know  how to do their job!  Golden rule, when a cop tells you to do something, DO IT!  Don&#8217;t backtalk, to fight them, don&#8217;t yell, and you will not get hurt.  Any problem this punk did have was because he did not respect the officers.  People like you make me sick.  You will be the first one to call on the police for help when you need them.  Are you going to questions their authority when they are protecting YOU?  I didn&#8217;t think so&#8230;..</p>

		<p>The idea that you could &#8220;get hurt&#8221; for talking back or yelling at a cop is disgusting, but true.  People who defend cops who injure suspects that aren&#8217;t being dangerous are the reason we have bad cops.  Bad cops know that there will always be authoritarian badge-lickers who will defend anything they do.</p>

		<p>This knee-jerk support of the unsupportable is hard to understand in light of the video &#8211; did you actually watch it? You can support law enforcement (as I do) but be throughly disgusted with the behavior of these deputies.  Their use of force here was completely unjustified &#8211; they behaved as unprofessional thugs and frankly should be fired.  Defending their behavior just because they wear a badge is really backwards &#8211; their job is to protect citizens &#8211; not terrorize and abuse them.  Being a police officer does not put you above the law and convey the right to commit assault whenever you please with impunity(and that is precisely what transpired here).  I never cease to be amazed at the mentality that police officers are apparently held to a lower standard that everyone else &#8211; it&#8217;s OK for them to beat and injure you if they perceive the aren&#8217;t being &#8220;respected&#8221;? Really?  The opposite is true &#8211; they should absolutely be held to a higher standard &#8211; and these guys obviously have no standards at all. They&#8217;re a disgrace to their badge and LE everywhere.</p>

		<p>Even last month so did The Honorable Federal Judge….<br />
so why are ALL these Fraud-Enforcement Officers, they think are Deputies, jibber jabber chatter clattering about some make believe an illusional picture story, on open public access chat rooms, which represents how easily natured these Criminal Cops are portraying to the public nothing but continuous falsifying a story like there was never a Court Order by an Honorable Federal Judge. They know the law, and ignorance can not be an excuse for their conduct of that of organized criminals under a county blanket of Authority!!…NOTE: WHEN A CIVILIAN IS NO LONGER CLASSIFIED AS  A CIVILIAN AND IS THUS FORTH BEEN CALLED UPON THROUGH SWORN OATH  AS TO BE, &#8220;FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE, BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE&#8221; OR &#8220;TO SERVE AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC &#8220;.  IT IS ALWAYS ELABORATELY DISCLOSED, CONVEYED CLEARLY THE CLEARANCE LEVELS AND RELATIONAL HIERARCHY&#8217;S AND WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE /NONPERMISSIBLE FOR THE DIFFERENT RANKS OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY. WHICH LEADS UP TO THE HIGHEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT. IT TURNS OUT THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICERS WHICH INCLUDE (FEDERAL JUDGES)  WILL ALWAYS OVER RULE ANY STATE OR COUNTY OFFICIAL OR MUNICIPALITY. THE PENALTIES FOR PERJURY ARE EXTREMELY SEVERE FOR A NON CIVILIANS SWORN UNDER OATH ESPECIALLY A LOWEST OF LOW DEPUTY  WHO HABITUALLY VIOLATE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL RUELS. CLEARLY IT HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED ALL THE UNLAWFUL CONDUCTING DEPUTIES WHO HAVE FORGOTTEN THE UN-FORGETFUL  RULE NEVER TO OEVER STEP A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS RULINGS.  THAT IS THE ULTIMATE DISRESPECT OF HIGHER RANKING OFFICERS AUTHORITIES. WE MUST NOT  FORGET THE FACT THAT THIS IS THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH FOR AND FOREMOST FOUNDED BY OUR FOREFATHERS ON FUNDAMENTAL  EMPIRICAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT RIGHTS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN INCLUDING EVERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF GOVERNING OFFICER. SO THESE PEACE OFFICERS CAN NOT BE SURPRISED TO FIND A NICE COLD CELL VIA PAYMENT OF UNLAWFUL MISCONDUCT AS OFFICIAL ENEMY OF THE STATE!!</p>
<p>VIA COURT ORDER:<br />

		<p>First of all this is a highly edited video. The audio has been altered or in some parts been deleted. Unstill you the complete story and not a very bias reporter and article.

		<p>I say great job deputies. Don&#8217;t let these punks get away with anything. Once these dirtbags feel like they can backtalk and be non-compliant, they will be the ones controling the jails. Swift aggressive action by the deputies keep the thousands of inmates in line. The few that are dumb enough to act a fool get what they deserve!!</p>

		<p>Talk about muckraking journalism.  Isn&#8217;t there a professional organization that monitors ethics in a writer&#8217;s work product.  That video shows a guy that struggled with deputies the entire time.  I say don&#8217;t settle &#8211; a jury will see how calm the deputies were, and how they were constantly asking him politely to comply.</p>

		<p>Court Ruled it was Excessive Force:<br />
2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>
<p>MR. Radwan is the Plaintiff.. Dishonorable Deputies are Defendants!! WOW court order already so stop with your bs propaganda OCSD!!!!!!</p>

		<p>Well that was 17+ minutes of useless video. 17 + minutes of my life I will never get back! I see more on COPS. I don&#8217;t see the excessive force here, but I do hear a lot of yelling or whining by the idiot. I noticed the Deputies remained calm, and I never saw any punches or any movement of their arms to indicate they hit Mr. Radwan. The headline gets the people&#8217;s attention, but it&#8217;s a disappointment after watching the video (which is good, I guess). Excessive force, not even close! There&#8217;s force, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s excessive. I wouldn&#8217;t compare this to the other incidents, like Ms. White&#8217;s incident. If I remember correctly, the force there was a bit excessive, and the Department paid for it.</p>

		<p>I agree with you. This rich punk was already saying I&#8217;m gonna sue you guys from the very beginning. If he would have cooperated from the beginning then he would have not been treated with reasonable force. He was such a drama queen screaming he can&#8217;t walk because the leg cuffs were to tight, but he didn&#8217;t scream when then put more pressure on the leg cuffs when they picked him up by the leg cuff chain. He is mentally ill and reminds me of the idiot from the &#8220;Don&#8217;t tase me bro, don&#8217;t tase me&#8221; guy.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t see excessive force.<br />
I do see him trying to get up after being gently laid on the hood of a police car. If he cooperated and just stayed still, none of this would have happened. It is simple to just do as you are told.</p>
<p>You have the right to remain silent and should use that until you can talk to a lawyer when being arrested. Mouthing off is not usually a good thing because anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.</p>

		<p>Who Cares what any of you Fools think!!! When The court has already made the decision. You can only fool the uneducated.</p>

		<p>What you have posted looks to me looks like a ruling on a motion for summary judgment for the defendants.  The judge granted the motion for some of them, and denied it for those who actually participated in the actions in question.  That does not mean they have been found guilty, it means they don&#8217;t get off without a trial (or without the remainder of the trial taking place) &#8211; because if the evidence produced so far is interpreted *in the light most favorable to the plaintiff*, the force, though moderate, is in excess of the amount needed under the circumstances.</p>
<p>It is still to be determined whether the evidence should be interpreted in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, or not &#8211; based on credibility of the witnesses, additional evidence that has not yet been presented, belief systems and prejudices of jurors (if this is a jury trial), etc.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been following the legal proceedings, so I don&#8217;t know if trial has already started, whether it&#8217;s a jury trial (as I would assume), how far into it it is, etc.  I&#8217;m just going by the text that was quoted from the judge&#8217;s ruling.</p>

		<p>Youth, badge, gun, lack of leadership and no example of a good role model in the management of the sheriff&#8217;s department is a bad situation.</p>
<p>Remember LA sheriff&#8217;s training school had to be shutdown due to corruption &#8211; anyone think OC is different?</p>

		<p>How is  a deputy supposed to know the difference between a person with Bipolar disorder and your average socio-path? Bipolars have manic episodes where they go beserk.</p>
<p>Where do we draw the line? Sorry Radwan, but I hope I am on the jury. If you don&#8217;t want the police to harm you, don&#8217;t break laws and take your meds.</p>

		<p>Seriously? Wait till it happens to you for no reason&#8230; see if you &#8220;waste tax payers money&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t the real waste paying these lowlifes a salary and pension to do nothing but beat up our neighbors?</p>

		<p>Once you are announced &#8221; Uncooperative&#8221; at the gate, there will be many punk deputies waiting for you. They will find any excuse to beat you during the process. I didn&#8217;t see a Supervising Sgt during the process and I really don&#8217;t think that would have mattered, but was one there? Ruthless gang punk deputies doing what they do best and that&#8217;s costing the taxpayers more than enough money.</p>

		<p>Uh, not much of a &#8220;beating&#8221; but not very good treatment.  And the deputy gets lost?  This is why I would rather have a local PD and not have jailers, I mean sheriffs, patroling my neighborhood.</p>

		<p>Wow, another &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; article by Tony and the crew at OCR. It&#8217;s amazing how much those creative writing classes have helped in coloring up the situation.</p>
<p>The artice title asks a question.  Why not just be honest and change the question mark to a period?  At least that would be more in line with all of the conclusions drawn in this article.  </p>
<p>Man this is some slanted reporting.</p>

		<p>I do agree with your reporting comments, but there isn&#8217;t much in the article of bias&#8230; other than only getting one side of the story, but you try reaching the DA for comment.</p>

		<p>I dont see the use of force. The article says Radwan was arrested for arguing with his girlfriend. I looked in the California Penal Code and i don&#8217;t see the violation for arguing with your girlfriend, so he must of physically done something to her. Radwan could of prevented all of this by keeping his mouth shut and following the deputies directives.</p>

		<p>2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>

		<p>Violation of a restraining order, court order or domestic violence is “arguing with your girlfriend” to the news media when they want to create sympathy for the crooks.</p>
<p>====================</p>
<p>#1) A restraining order IS a court order and violating it is a criminal offense, against the law</p>
<p>#2) arguing with ANYONE  is NOT a criminal offense or against the law</p>

		<p>Yes there are many types of court orders. violating any of them is a criminal offense and that is what he was arrested for. Yet instead of stating he was arrested for violating a court order the register implies he was arrested for arguing with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Therefore &#8220;arguing with your girlfriend&#8221; is OCR media speak for CPC 166.</p>
<p>As for point 2. Actually verbal arguement can rise to the level of criminal conduct. anything from cpc 415 to cpc 422. Depends on what was said in the arguement.</p>

<p>=======================<br />
No &#8220;ARGUING&#8221; is not criminal conduct. Terrorists threast are not &#8220;arguing&#8221;. They are criminal threats-big difference.</p>

		<p>Obviously arguing with the cops is a criminal offense.You should be able to question the cops about you are being arrested,why should a civilian be threatened and feel threatened just for wanting to know why you are being charged for?Go to a country where your life is threatened every minute of the day and you begin to realize that the cops here make up situations where they force the victims to become angry because they are being unfairly arrested or unfairly treated and they know their rights are being abused.Cops should be able to tell the difference between a real criminal and a person defending his rights but of course you are not allowed to think for yourself in these situations,you are supposed to become total idiots an be at the cop&#8217;s mercy and hopefully they won&#8217;t feel like being to hard on you even if you are innocent and let you go with some stupid warning,when you didn&#8217;t do anything wrong any way.Cops are not here to protect you,they are here to fill there ego bubbles,the only way you can be sure if you are safe is to look after yourself,don&#8217;t trust anyone.</p>

		<p>Yes &#8211; by all means never speak up, always follow orders given by a power-tripping deputy, don&#8217;t make eye contact, be as servile as possible and maybe, just maybe &#8211; you won&#8217;t get wrongfully arrrested and beaten.  Great philosophy &#8211; worked well for the Nazi&#8217;s too.</p>

		<p>So where is the excessive use of force? Boring! I just wasted 16:47 minutes of my life. The OCR states he comes from a wealthly family. It doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t still breed losers.</p>

		<p>There was no beating here. A wimpy over reacting guy with a very low pain threshold and a little too emotional. With that said, I hope he gets every penny. These sheriffs are A-Holes especially in that area. Little wusses with a badge. They make me sick with their abuse of authority.</p>
<p>South county OC Sheriffs have ruined any respect I had for LE in this area.</p>

		<p>I agree. What bothers me more is that no one cares that most people lack respect for law enforcement due to their encounters with the Sherriff&#8217;s department. The OC Register puts these stories out quite often but just imagine all the mistreatment that doesn&#8217;t make the paper.</p>

		<p>Haha&#8230;me a cop? I hate cops. I have no respect for them whatsoever. My point was&#8230;there is much more abuse going on within OCSD that is never reported in the media. Get a clue, did you even read my post?</p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s the thing&#8230;.keep in mind i&#8217;m not excusing anyones actions. You see the video and can pick it apart as to what you think happened, even though you were&#8217;nt there. What you don&#8217;t experience is what the deputies are feeling&#8230;.not emotionally but physically. So many people are quick to judge by what they see, read or hear but were never on scene when it happened. I don&#8217;t get it, you people don&#8217;t want to be judged yet you are so quick to do it to others.</p>

		<p>it definitely seems to me this is a culture problem, which may have something to do with how ocsd first  trains their deputies by having them work in the jails for several years before putting them out on the streets. i think this really might create an us vs them mentality, and perceive any &#8220;suspect&#8221; as what they may have encountered in the jail.</p>

		<p>The expectation is for law enforcement to protect society and its laws. That goes for everyone even this guy who received a severe beating when it was unnecessary. The Sheriff&#8217;s Departments code of ethics is do so screwed up that they do not know the difference between a sick guy and a real criminal threat. Pitiful&#8230;</p>

		<p>Can you please point out when the severe beating took place?  As for the Sheriff&#8217;s having some magical ability to determine someone with a psychological disorder and a &#8220;criminal&#8221; how are they supposed to do that?  Many disorders cannot be determined except by a trained professional (psychologist..etc).  You were not there and have only seen one side of the story.  He claims he kicked his tire and some motorist called the police&#8230;.there is more to the story then he is telling.  But go ahead and make your judgements based on partial facts.  You already demonstrate your bias and lack of knowledge of law enforcement in general.</p>

		<p>Funny that most of the negative comments are based on the reserve officer. An unpaid volunteer who is a working professional with an education likely exceeding that of a typical paid street cop.</p>
<p>I guess maturity and education are not the solution to LE &#8220;problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young jail Deputies were the most professional cops shown in the video. They never lost their temper. They gave clear instructions to the inmate. Explained what the inmate needed to do and what the consequences would be if he resisted or delayed the booking process.</p>

		<p>100% yes they used excessive force. I went to h.s. with acouple guys that became OCS. They&#8217;ve been with the force well over 10 years. One a jailer, the other a gang enforcement officer. Now they are both without a job. I&#8217;ve spoken with them both and guess what they&#8217;ve admitted that excessive force is okay. The last time I was in OCJ was 15years ago and yes it did go on. They got cought, no pay the price deputies.</p>

		<p>Once again, the watchdog tells a once sided story instead of actual reporting.  The reporter takes information from one source, with no corroboration, and writes it as fact.  This is the reason that I never take anything the Register says at face value.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s 17 minutes I&#8217;ll never get back.</p>
<p>Talk about an axe to grind.  Saavedra&#8217;s story is the most biased and colored against law enforcement I&#8217;ve seen in this paper.  The comments (presumably) Saavedra makes in the captions show him trying to embarass the deputies.  &#8220;When he protested he was taken off camera and Tased&#8221;?  Really, that&#8217;s what you saw Tony?  You left out where Radwan ASKED the deputies to pick up his legs.</p>
<p>If Radwan had cooperated and fought his case in court (where you&#8217;re supposed to contest arrests) and not on the street, this would be a non-issue.</p>
<p>There are no blows shown on the video, they use bodily force and numbers to keep Radwan subdued.  Isn&#8217;t that what we&#8217;ve asked them to do?  These deputies deal with uncooperative people by the boatload, and it&#8217;s not fun.  But guess what, there are lots of cooperative prisoners who have absolutely no issues.</p>

		<p>You know, I&#8217;ve NEVER met someone that hated cops that wasn&#8217;t involved in something illegal, except for wimpy guys that got slapped around by their mommy and as a result, have life-long contempt for any authority figure. Which one are you, CopPower?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t fear the police at all. I don&#8217;t do anything illegal, and if by chance I happen to get caught speeding, I just do what they ask and they do their job and then I get on with the rest of my day. It&#8217;s pretty simple. Don&#8217;t act like an ass, swear at them, whine about &#8220;your rights&#8221; as though you know the law better than they do, or tell them that you&#8217;re going to sue them. For you CopPower, I&#8217;ll tell you a little secret that will improve your relationship with the police &#8211; tell them that your taxes pay their salary. They LOVE to hear that from a useless waste of flesh.</p>
<p>Bottom line &#8211; losers always have a problem with the police.</p>

		<p>Serious smack down, rex?  Please.  Coming up with grade-school comebacks does not equate &#8220;serious smack down&#8221;.</p>
<p>spinoc, you said it.  People who have had problems with the police because of their behavior are the ones who have issues with the police.  </p>
<p>And Sarah, take a report?  That&#8217;s all they police officers do?  So all those murderers, rapists, child molesters, drug dealers, burglars, robbers, and wife beaters that are in jails and prisons right now, did what? Turn themselves in to the prison because of a guilty conscience?</p>

		<p>How are deputies supposed to know the difference between someone with a mental problem and people who is actually a danger to them? Deputies have to put safety first and foremost. The moment they don&#8217;t do that then one of them gets killed. Now I&#8217;m not saying there aren&#8217;t bad cops because I know from first hand experience that there are, but the actual percentage is maybe 1%. Yes, that is too much. When someone is Tased, there is always another option other than the tasing. That other option is shooting to kill. Deputies do not always have the option of sitting around and talking somone &#8220;off the ledge&#8221; so to speak. It&#8217;s funny how people assume that the suspect is immediately innocent and the deputies are guilty. The officers were called out for a reason. The writers of this article have put their own slant on this. I wonder who was the one that pointed out when the shoulder became dislocated?</p>

		<p>So you dont think that cops should possess negotiating skills when working with the public? A good cop knows how to negotiate without having to use excessive force. Cops act so tough but it always takes 5 cops to hold one guy down!</p>

		<p>The logic behind overwhelming numbers is to insure officer safety and also the safety of the suspect.  It may not seem that way to someone who has no clue about police procedures, but a suspect that is swarmed cannot resist or fight back.  That way they are not seriously injured, as would be the case if an officer needed to respond physically one on one.  Look at the statistics in Phoenix Az before and after the deployment of the Taser.  Clearly shows a decline in serious injuries and even fatalities.</p>

		<p>What is there to negotiate&#8230;did he have a hostage?  You comply with the officers instructions.  Its not a negotiation.  If you fail to comply, your a moron.  Most things in these situations happen in a split second.  They don&#8217;t know the history or mental state of the individual, or if they are on PCP or some other substance.  Its easy to be judgmental when your not out dealing with this on a daily basis.  You already stated that you hate cops, so why the hate?  Cops have to deal with the ugly side of society everyday.  There are some bad ones thats for sure, but a majority do a great job protecting us.  All they get is your hate and scorn,,based on what your uninformed opinions?</p>

		<p>Negotiating is fine as long as the everyone involved is free to leave. But once it is an arrest situation the time for negotiation is over. At that time the suspect either submits to the officers arrest authority or force may be used to force his submission to arrest.</p>

		<p>JustAGuy, you miss the point of the article altogether.  Police officers are public servants hired to protect the public not torture them.  There is nothing in the videos that show any physical resistant by Mr. Radwan.  He verbally objects to whatever those cops were doing to him off camera.  Just what were they doing all that time to him?  Answer this question!  Why did all of the deputies not have their voice recorders on which is a mandatory requirement of their own department.  The answer is obvious, they wanted to mistreat Radwan and they did not want us to know it.  And Dina appears to believe it is alright to mistreat people who have mental disorders even though there is nothing in this story to show that Mr. Radwan was anyway mentally impaired or acting in an irrational or combative manner.  By the way, is this the same Joshua Radwan the Register reported on in this story? <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/nelligan-157278-car-fuentes.html?pic=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.ocregister.com/articles/nelligan-157278-car-fuentes.html?pic=1</a></p>

		<p>Ok, Rob.  Yes, police officers are public servants hired to protect the public.  Torture?  Really?  Nothing in the video that shows that Radwan is resisting?  First of all, what happened before Saavedra shows Radwan on the hood?  Could there be something there?  Maybe it wasn&#8217;t provided, it&#8217;s not mentioned in the story because Saavedra has an axe to grind.</p>
<p>You can tell by watching Radwan that he is pushing back on the officers while being searched.  He&#8217;s not cooperating from the beginning.  He had weapons in his car that are FELONIES to possess.  So you don&#8217;t think they deputies are going to search him extra carefully?  If he keeps pushing back on the officers, they are going to push him forward.</p>
<p>Why were the recorders off during the car stop?  I don&#8217;t know.  But it&#8217;s not so &#8220;obvious&#8221; as you say and doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a conspiracy.  You can still hear the voices from the microphone that&#8217;s in the car.</p>
<p>And about mentally ill people.  What are the deputies supposed to do?  Many mentally ill people are violent.  They are not psychologists treating someone, they are taking him into custody for a crime, and Radwan didn&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>Fight it in court, not on the street.  People just don&#8217;t get that.  As someone else said, give respect, get respect.</p>

		<p>And about mentally ill people. What are the deputies supposed to do? Many mentally ill people are violent.<br />
==================</p>
<p>Violent?? Soem are, others are not-dont make up falsehoods like that to support your weak argument.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
 They are not psychologists treating someone, they are taking him into custody for a crime,<br />
===============<br />
You may have heard of this mew tool the state and it&#8217;s muni&#8217;s use for cops-it is called TRAINING. It involves teaching cops-who have authority to use deadly force-how to handle and deal with the mentally disabled and ill-and it is ALWAYS taught NOT to use force when words will work. I guess you slept thru that training in your academy class.</p>
<p>Fight it in court, not on the street. People just don’t get that. As someone else said, give respect, get respect.<br />
================<br />
Being mouthy and getting the tar kicked out of you for it is not &#8220;respect&#8221; it is illegal conduct, but since the idiot cops wont pay the legal judgments/bills they have no reason to folow the law.</p>

		<p>This is one of the reasons why I take very little of what any of the &#8220;OC Watchdog&#8221; reporters have to say with any seriousness. It seems they all have some sort of axe to grind.</p>
<p>Was this excessive force? I don&#8217;t know, and I really don&#8217;t care. It seems to me what we have is some spoiled rich kid from So County who holds himself above the law. And, as is typical, police officers will know how to knock these people on their backside. It&#8217;s really quite simple: when confronted with the man (or woman) in uniform with a gun, settle down, loose the attitude, and DO AS YOU ARE TOLD.</p>

		<p>You don&#8217;t think all the other monetary rewards given out by several different juries due to excessive force by cops is not enough supporting documentation to make this a valid claim? This stuff happens all the time, it has nothing to do with a rich kid. Dont be jealous that his life turned out better than yours.

		<p>Chele,</p>
<p>Read your manual again, it&#8217;s police 101.</p>
<p>Excessive force is:</p>
<p>Excessive force by a law enforcement officers is a violation of a person&#8217;s rights. Excessive force is not subject to a precise definition, but it is generally beyond the force a reasonable and prudent law enforcement officer would use under the circumstances. </p>
<p>Force should be used in only the minimum amount needed to achieve a legitimate purpose. Police brutality is a direct violation of the laws within the police force. The use of excessive force is also a direct violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S Constitution regarding cruelty and protection of the laws. </p>
<p>KEY WORD&#8230;.. MINIMUM&#8230; if you break someones bones, dislocate their joints, that&#8217;s EXCESSIVE.</p>
<p>KNOW, you lose the attitude!!!!!</p>

		<p>It looks to me like Radwans attorney&#8217;s wrote this article and written comments on the video. In the article Radwan claimes he decided to sue when he was Tased but you can clearly hear him say he was going to sue all of them while he was on the hood. </p>
<p>The sholder injury came when he was being pulled out of the car &#8221; at his request&#8221; bucause the cuffs were uncomfortable. give me a break, this south county crybaby simply had no experience in submiting to authority and dug himself into this hole. </p>
<p>Except for the &#8220;minor&#8221; head bump into the hood I saw no wrong doing by any of the deputies.</p>

		<p>North Co,</p>
<p>Your quote &#8220;The shoulder injury came when he was being pulled out of the car ” at his request” because the cuffs were uncomfortable. give me a break, this south county crybaby simply had no experience in submitting to authority and dug himself into this hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you pull, push, toss someone out of the car where it dislocates their shoulder, like it or not,  that&#8217;s excessive force!</p>

		<p>Maybe the exchange should go something like:<br />
 &#8220;Sir please use your inside voice&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sir could you please fill out the psychological evaluation so that we know how we should proceed&#8221;<br />

		<p>Mike said &#8220;Give respect; get respect&#8221;.  Radwan became argumentative from the beginning, which set the stage for escalation.<br />
In a job  where you daily confront threats to your own safety, you better believe every person is seen as a possible threat.<br />
People should realize that it is in their best interest not to set up an attitude of confrontation at the first sight of a police officer.</p>

		<p>Why don&#8217;t these deputies turn on their recorders? It would protect them and save taxpayer&#8217;s a lot of money and maybe that would deter them from doing bad things to people.</p>

		<p>No evidence they were not turned out.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a common problem.</p>
<p>The recorder is out of range? accuse the cop of not turning it on.</p>
<p>The recorder has a dead battery? Accuse the cop of not turning it on.</p>
<p>The recorder cannot communicate with the receiver? Accuse the cop of not turning it on.</p>
<p>The recorder simply does not work? Accuse the cop of not turning it on.</p>
<p>The default setting is to blaim the cop. a better question is &#8220;why is there no audio recording from a belt mounted microphone?&#8221; It seeks the truth without assigning blaim.</p>

		<p>Excessive force? Give me a break. They only thing they did wrong per OCSD policy is not turn on their mics. I was also a little surprised to see only a few deputies at the receiving area, especially if the arriving deputy told them he had an uncooperative. There is normally between 10-12 deputies that come out to pick them up. I guess because it was Christmas eve they were light on staffing. He could have saved him self some grief by cooperating with the deputies. It&#8217;s not a good time to try your case while you are being searched on the hood of the car. The deputies did nothing wrong; however, there were a lot of things that guy could have done to prevent what happened to him. Constantly turning around like that is a big no no. To a deputy, it could mean the person wants to run or fight. &#8220;Getting stiff&#8221; like he was doing is also a big no no. His head got pushed into the hood because was being uncooperative and resisting the deputies. He might something because of being tased while cuffed, but nothing else. Unless that jury is stupid.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t mean the deputy pushed his head in to the car on purpose because he was resisting. His head was pushed in to the car because he was trying to get up and the deputy was holding him down. It was when he relaxed a little, while the deputy was still pushing on him, that he was forced in to the hood of the car.</p>

		<p>Argue that with the Judgement</p>
<p>2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>

		<p>Hm. Never had any of that happen to me. </p>
<p>Oh wait, I&#8217;m not a law breaking, whining, sniveling, self-entitled brat with an attitude with obvious contempt for authority. That might have something to do with it. </p>
<p>And Tony, seriously&#8230; using plaintiff counsel&#8217;s own video in your article? Have you no shame? If you did your own PRA the video wouldn&#8217;t have the narration and fly-in captions. </p>
<p>Said before, true to the core; respect = respect. Do what you&#8217;re told, your remedy is with the court system not the deputy on the street.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s the best you have? A rhetorical question that doesn&#8217;t even apply in this case?</p>
<p>This prisoner was not being killed, he was under arrest and being transported to jail; during this event he was uncooperative and had an unpleasant experience. </p>
<p>Prisoners need to understand that their lack of cooperation during the transportation phase of their event may experience a dynamic shift in their jail experience. He was given the option to cooperate on many occasions and chose option B.</p>

<p>shut you damn mouth otherwise a sleeping Giant will turn its attention towards internal affairs!! There is already a Judgement the deputies are criminals and Mr. Radwan is the Victom so stop  lying to our public sector who has no knowledge that a Federal Judge has already determined that you piece of work should be treat as a war criminal! and maybe that might just happen when the truth comes out on courtroom scripts and this issue become an international Affair</p>

		<p>If you don&#8217;t like the cops handling your business for you then don&#8217;t call them. It&#8217;s that simple. Apparently this crook has a mental problem that all his families wealth can&#8217;t seem to tame. Rather than shut his mouth all he does is whine and complain. Bet you he was housed in the mental unit when he got to jail because the other inmates would have shown less restraint than the deputies.</p>

		<p>So, its a crime to refuse to stop talking simply because a bully cop orders you to?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>By the way. The family wealth has zero to do with this event.  Your statement with regard to wealth is immature.</p>

		<p>wow&#8230;.where&#8217;s the excessive force? you people don&#8217;t know anything. The guy was clearly resisiting. Let me educate you&#8230;if you continue to move around you are resisting. They were holding his head&#8230;that just goes to show you he was resisting and trying to move his head &#8211; police can use the amount of force used to overcome resistance &#8211; that&#8217;s the law. So if he is moving around they can hold his head. Take anohter look at the video but if you saw what i saw then you saw him move his body abrutly and that&#8217;s when the deputies took him to the ground &#8211; or did they &#8211; you can&#8217;t see anything from there.  If the guy was tased prove it. There are ways. I&#8217;m just saying there is more to this story &#8211; more things the avergae person knows nothing about &#8211; the law.  but you people will think what you want so i&#8217;m wasting my breath &#8230;&#8230;.good job once again by the OC register to bash law enforcement&#8230;.way to go&#8230;. i think they get brownie points for the most comments they get for their articles&#8230;..kinda sad if you ask me.</p>

		<p>police can use the amount of force used to overcome resistance – that’s the law<br />
====================<br />
And if they go over the amount NECESSARY then they are using excessive force&#8230;this video is not very good, so I can&#8217;t make a fair determination.</p>

<p>The standard is one of being REASONABLE.  It is not one of being NECESSARY as you tried to point out.  </p>
<p>Were the actions REASONABLE for the conditions.  That&#8217;s how the incident is judged.</p>

		<p>Actually you are both half right. An officer may use a reasonable amount of force necessary to overcome resistance. </p>
<p>Dislocating a shoulder is not reasonable or necessary. </p>
<p>Was this guy &#8220;mouthy&#8221; oh yes. Is that being uncooperative? Courts in the past have ruled &#8220;no&#8221;.</p>

			November 11, 2010 at 1:39 pm</a>		</div>

		<p>well this is what Your Honorable Judge Concluded<br />
2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>

These guys have enough to worry about on the streets of this country, let alone deal with an idiot like Radwan, I heard himsay he has rights, yeah dumbass you also have the right to remain silent.

===========<br />
I agree 100%-unless you&#8217;re getting the tar kicked out of you ala Rodney King style&#8230;..</p>
<p>BTW-being &#8220;mouthy&#8221; is NOT against the law&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; nor is it grounds for beating the tar out of someone. If a cop encounters someone who is mouthy they can just IGNORE IT. If they go beyond being mouthy then they have the right to restrain the person as necessary.</p>

		<p>For you people who think any &#8220;excessive force&#8221; was used, you have got to be kidding me. I don&#8217;t know what style of &#8220;life experiences&#8221; you have had or what kind of jobs you have/done in your lifetime, believe me this tape showed not signs of &#8220;excessive force.&#8221; This tape will exonerate those deputies.<br />
&#8220;Finally arriving at the scene, Hergesheimer can be heard on the video responding, “I’ll get him good,” after being told that Radwan had already been searched.&#8221;&#8212;&#8212;- I interpret Hergesheimer&#8217;s statement as meaning &#8220;I&#8217;ll search him again real good.&#8221;<br />
The deputies should sue Joshua Radwan and his attorney<br />
for filling false charges.<br />
What do you want &#8220;Police Officers&#8221; to do, sing Kumbaya while they are booking a suspect. Grow up and join the real world people.</p>

=======================<br />
Please, if he meant SEARCH him real good he would have said just that SEARCH HIM REAL GOOD-not GET HIM REAL GOOD.</p>
<p>======================</p>
<p>The deputies should sue Joshua Radwan and his attorney<br />

<p>If the deputies win they can sue for filing false charges-malicious prosecution.</p>

		<p>Welcome to life in Orange County, I could go on and on about instances of excessive force used by OC Sheriff Dept.   Orange Co Sheriffs Dept is the last resort if you have a problem to call, you cannot  trust them and actually the city of Laguna Niguel needs to reevaluate their contract with them or hire a citizen ride along because it is really scary here in Orange Co.  Power trip doesnt even begin to cover them, it&#8217;s more like you are guilty until they tell you otherwise and they wont listen, understand or even try to, Laguna Niguel really needs to get ahold of this before they end up in a lawsuit over it also. There are a lot of bad apples out there ruining their reputation for the good ones, sad but even the good ones are hard to deal with.</p>

		<p>1) No microphones turned on &#8211; on ANY of the LE?  2) Absolutely ZERO reason for him to be pinned up against vehicle for that long a period.  It&#8217;s not safe for either LE or him.  3) Slamming his head?  Ridiculous &#8211; that&#8217;s stuff you learn NOT TO DO in the academy.  4) The clown getting lost on his way to jail &#8211; hilarious.  </p>
<p>#4 nonewithstanding, the kids got a viable claim. If LE doesn&#8217;t settle, they are idiots.  Why &#8211; video PLUS you have to believe that his attorney&#8217;s found stuff on at least 4 of the Deputies involved.</p>

		<p>My observations, also.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take ten minutes of pinning the guy to the car to successfully search him.</p>
<p>And, yes, wasn&#8217;t it revealing that all the cops involved had turned off their microphones so they could lie in their reports about what was said?</p>
<p>My major anger is that I expect the victim to win his lawsuit, and he should, but that the criminal cops won&#8217;t have to pay out of their own pocket nor will they be fired.</p>
<p>We need a law to force criminal cops to pay their own court ordered damages. That would slow down their bully attitude.</p>
<p>We also need a law to force the firing / termination of any cop caught engaging in lies within an arrest report. In San Francisco, they&#8217;ve found 125 cops who have been documented liars and they&#8217;re still on the job !  As a juror, would you believe a cop&#8217;s testimony who had a documented history of lies????????????</p>

		<p>And, yes, wasn’t it revealing that all the cops involved had turned off their microphones so they could lie in their reports about what was said?</p>
<p>===================</p>
<p>And that is not standard operating proceedure to turn off a microphone, or video tape or anything else meant to memorialize the encounters cops face on the street with citizens or suspects.</p>
<p> Video tape and microphones are to protect the cops-=and protect the citizens from the cops. That is what they are for-to record the encounter.</p>
<p>Once the cops get deposed or hit the witness strand and that fact comes out they are <b>toast.</b></p>
<p>There was NO reason to do that except for cover of illegal cop actions-and it is on video tape-pretty stupid if you ask me.</p>

		<p>Its winter time, he&#8217;s wearing biulky clothing and not cooperating. It takes as long to search him as the transporting offer needs to ensure the prisoner is not bringing contraband into the jail. Contraband that may be as small as a piece of meth the size of a grain of rice. How long would it take you to find that in someones parka while they are squirming around?</p>

		<p>No microphones turned on?</p>
<p>Here’s a common problem.</p>
<p>The equipment room is out of mics? accuse the cop of not turing it on.<br />
===================<br />
Just an excuse-out of mics order MORE, and make sure you have enough.</p>
<p>The recorder is out of range? accuse the cop of not turning it on.<br />
======================<br />
Yes, 20 feet from the unit is &#8220;out of range&#8221; get serious.</p>
<p>The recorder has a dead battery? Accuse the cop of not turning it on.<br />
======================<br />
Dead battery!!! Hahahaha&#8230;&#8230;Here is an idea-check the battery before the shift-just like you do with your gun and car. I can see it now &#8220;But Sgt., my gun had no bullets in it-I didn&#8217;t check to see if it was loaded before the shift started&#8221; <img src='http://taxdollars.ocregister.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The recorder cannot communicate with the receiver? Accuse the cop of not turning it on.<br />
==================<br />
See above about checking equipment.</p>
<p>The recorder simply does not work? Accuse the cop of not turning it on.<br />
================<br />
See above about checking equipment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;His cries reverberated on a dark street in Laguna Niguel late Dec. 23, 2006, and off the walls of the Orange County Jail as the clock ticked into Christmas Eve.&#8221; -Tony Saavedra are you a journalist or a a Stephen King wanna-be. </p>
<p>The video speaks for itself but Tony you speak for your own personal biases against cops and nothing more.  I think the cops showed restraint in dealing with Mr. Bipolar. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the OC needs another bipolar pot smoker running amok with a cache of martial art weaponry.</p>
<p>Props the to Green Wave.</p>

		<p>Sofa boy, you are clueless. Cops are not saints. They make mistakes, sometimes on purpose. Watch the video again and listen for the attitude of the reserve deputy. He arrives on scene late and mad for getting lost. He says something to the effect of &#8220;getting him good&#8221;. That speaks loud and clear to his state of mind, which is one thing the jury will be asked to focus on. Strike one. Just that may result in big $$ being awarded. The guy is already cuffed, had already been searched, and just needed to be transported to jail. Mouthing off is not cause for slamming his face in to the car hood, breaking his glasses and cutting his nose. Pulling him off the car hood when he is clearly not physically resisting and then tasering him handcuffed off camera is not within policy, which the jury will also be told. That is strike two so far and we are not even at the jail. The deputy then calls a non-cooperative intake knowing that 6-8 deputies will come out anticipating some action. When the arestee doesnt act out like they expected, they go to town on him anyways. Adrenelin is already pumping and what do you expect? They never back down no matter what. So then he is laying on the floor with at least 4 deputies on him. At one point you can see how limp his leg is when they let it go to get his pants off. They go ahead and again rachet up his legs in a pain compliance hold once the pants are off even though he is not resisting. Finally, they dislocate his shoulder just to get his t-shirt off while holding him down so it wont come off easily. Their own body weight on him causes everyone to feel as if he is resisting, when it is actually their actions that are creating the resistance. That is strike 3. They top it off by telling him to get up so the nurse can clear him from behind a closed door as if she/he can see the disloctaed shoulder with their magic glasses. Strike 4 and that will amount to some big bucks. The saddest part is no one will be disciplined. Nothing will change. Just another big pay out from a county that is already broke. </p>
<p>ps: never been a jail inmate but have put plenty of people in there. I have seen firsthand the act first figure it out later overreaction by a small but powerful group of deputies who intimidate everyone else into silence and complicity. Even their Sgts. are afraid of them and either look the other way or disappear at just the right moment. That is nothing to be proud of, green wave indeed.</p>

		<p>Wow, mr. smith.  Can a post be more wrong in all of its conclusions?</p>
<p>You are clearly already biased against the police to assume to know what the reserve deputy meant or was going to do by one statement, but ok, I guess you have magic glasses too.  So much for strike one.</p>
<p>The suspect is pushing back the entire time he is being searched.  You can see his body language and the tension in his face and the tension in the deputy&#8217;s hand that Radwan is pushing back.  So what does is the deputy doing?  He&#8217;s pushing forward to overcome Radwan&#8217;s pushing back.  Eventually, he pushes hard enough to make Radwan stop pushing back and Radwan&#8217;s face hits the hood.  Not tasering handcuffed suspects was not against policy in 2006 (please read more carefully next time) So much for strike two.</p>
<p>You should be HAPPY that they called him an uncooperative suspect, because there is now video, that there otherwise would not have been.  I&#8217;m not sure where you see the &#8220;excessive force&#8221; on that part of the video, but they use overwhelming force on Radwan so that he has no way to lash out and fight.  That&#8217;s what the public has told OCSD that we want them to do.  Don&#8217;t hit them, don&#8217;t taser them, use overwhelming force of numbers to keep them compliant.  As for the dislocated shoulder, all of the armchair commentators on this board have pointed to various parts of the video for the moment the &#8220;dislocation&#8221; occurred.  Non-issue, so much for strike three.</p>
<p>And you want to be the nurse that walks into a cell with uncooperative prisoners to touch them?  We already know you have magic glasses, so maybe the nurse borrowed yours.  So much for strike four.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;ve established that you have no strikes and no balls.</p>
<p>Once a prisoner has been uncooperative, it is not a big stretch for them to go off again, especially the mentally unstable.  Your logic is to let the guy go off again and for a deputy or nurse to get injured.  No thank you.  </p>
<p>Good post, Sofaking Tired</p>

		<p>Radwan’s crime: possessing three ornamental knives in his SUV, in what deputies alleged was a violation of a court restraining order. The knives were gifts for his father, Radwan said. Deputies also found pepper spray and less than an ounce of marijuana.<br />
Radwan says the deputies were mistaken in their interpretation of the restraining order, which only forbade him from carrying firearms. Radwan at the time was awaiting trial on charges of robbery, which were ultimately dismissed for lack of evidence. He pleaded guilty to possession of nunchakus, a martial arts weapon.</p>
<p>So a felon with priors happens to be Bi-Polor. Which means he had the right to remain silent, but not the ability. the Deputies have a job to do and are tempted to go beyond what is allowed. The question for the jury is did they cross the line or not. I would have to see the medical report, but dislocating a shoulder is usually over the line in a case like this, as is tasering someone already in custody (unless they break free and fight&#8211;but then they aren&#8217;t in custody. . .)</p>

		<p>Mr. Radwan The Victim/Plaintiff was never convicted but the deputies were…look as follows</p>
<p>2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>

		<p>Tim, you keep posting that same ruling, which is NOT a conviction.  It is a refusal to simply acquit them without any further process, based on the evidence that has been presented so far.</p>
<p>The cops who didn&#8217;t do anything were granted summary judgment &#8211; because no prima facie case was made that they had actually done anything.</p>
<p>The ones who did something were not granted summary judgment &#8211; because a prima facie case had been made against them, and they would have to defend themselves against the accusations and evidence presented against them.</p>

		<p>If I were on the Federal jury hearing his case right now, I&#8217;d vote in favor of damages against the deputies. They clearly used muscle and they virtually admitted they were in the wrong by intentionally turning off their belt microphones in direct violation of departmental policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the taxpayer loses every time a criminal cop gets sued successfully. Its the taxpayers who have to lose the money even though the victim wins.</p>
<p>Then, the cops are not fired.</p>
<p> In San Francisco, they just discovered that they have 125 or so cops on the job who have been documented liars. Their department, the SFPD, then violated State Law by not alerting prosecutors and defense attorney&#8217;s that the cops might lie in various criminal cases.</p>
<p>We need a new California State Law that has teeth and which forces cops who are convicted of criminal behavior or any misconduct to pay the victim out of the cops own pockets. Why should taxpayers have to pay for criminal cops?</p>

		<p>rex, you are a one trick pony.</p>
<p>How many MAs and PhDs do you possess?  Clearly you are so educated.  You bathe us in your logic, insight, and intellect on a daily basis.</p>
<p>You always love the GED comment, so put your cards on the table.  Of course, no way to verify it.</p>

======</p>
<p>FACT= 80% of ALL new hires in PD&#8217;s in major metro areas have just a GED or HS Diploma-at hire. That has been the standard for at least 25+ Years-I am sure it was more than 80% going back further  in time. Jo Ann Galinski-the friggen SHERIFF only had a GED and a 9th grade education</p>
<p>FACT= You could fill EVERY single cop and FF position that opens up with a college graduate today-they don&#8217;t so they can keep the cronyism and nepotism gravy train rolling.</p>
<p>Sorry, the LE spin won&#8217;t work here.</p>
<p>As for Rex, he may not be the smartest dog on the block but Rex will run circles around Jo Ann Galinski on ANY standardized test.</p>

		<p>I hope this man bankrupts the city of Laguna Niguel and that ALL badged street thugs get fired.  They are worse than street gangs in that instead of wearing colors so we know what they are, they carry badges to fool us into thinking they are &#8220;the good guys.&#8221;  What a joke! They are egotistical thugs who&#8217;d rather beat up a guy for kicking his own tire on his vehicle than chasing down an armed, hardened known criminal.  Unconscionable that one of those thugs threatened him by saying, &#8220;You get up and you&#8217;ll be shot.  Do you understand?&#8221;  The man was extremely polite, using the word &#8220;please&#8221; repeatedly.  Not one thug showed him an ounce of humanity.  Any citizen who calls the thugs the next time they see someone kick their own tire on their own vehicle better keep in mind that next time they could be the victim of the thugs.  Mind your own business because there are no &#8220;good guys.&#8221;  Just gang members wearing badges.</p>

		<p>The bottom line is that you cannot taser someone who is already completely under control.  End of story.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t control yourself, if you overreact to some kid shooting his mouth off, then you may be in the wrong line of work.  I don&#8217;t care if you had a crappy day, if your wife just left you, if your baby puked on you as you were trying to leave for work, if the bum you last hauled down to the station took a swing at you.  You&#8217;re paid to be a professional so act like one.</p>
<p>I do put a great deal of the blame on the department itself, the management of the department and it&#8217;s unwillingness to create an environment and culture where the rank and file understand that they cannot step over the line.</p>

		<p>I watch the entire video. He was never once punched, slapped, kicked, kneed or elbowed. The only force shown on the video was control holds and pain compliance.</p>

		<p>Common sense tells you the force went beyond &#8220;control holds and pain compliance,&#8221; whatever compliance is supposed to mean.  The man has a dislocated shoulder, cut on face, broken glasses, etc.&#8221;  So what precinct are you from?</p>

		<p>Your reaction seems to be based more on emotion than &#8220;common sense.&#8221;  But neither has any place in a use of force discussion. What matters is state law, federal law and the applicable case law.</p>
<p>It will be the job of the county lawyers to educate the jury on the applicable law and then they will judge the incident according to the objectively reasonal standard set by graham &amp; garner.</p>

		<p>Here is the law kid</p>
<p>2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>

		<p>What happened was unacceptable. Too bad I am not selected for jury duty this time because I am thinking of seven figures award for the victim.</p>

		<p>wow you already made up your mind without hearing both sides&#8230;.thank god for jury selection.  I was always taught to hear both sides of an argument before deciding.  I guess your more of a reactionary kind of person and facts just get in the way of the truth.</p>

		<p>We just saw and heard both sides.  Are deaf and dumb?  And do you think it was just a &#8220;coincidence&#8221; that all officers violated the rule of turning on their belt microphones?  Hopefully, you will not be selected for this man&#8217;s jury because you cannot recognize facts when they&#8217;re right in your face.</p>

		<p>Are you in the LE field?  Are you familiar with policy and procedure?  You make assumptions and accusations based upon your own bias.  I want to let you in on a little secret, when you are subduing someone who is not complying with directions it looks harsh.  You make the blanket statement   that there are alot of cops on here justifying , but I&#8217;m not a LEO.  I am educated on the subject, and understand the realities of what they face.  In your daily job do you run the risk of being shot?  Every time an officer approaches a car or situation they have no idea how it can turn out.  Walk in their shoes for awhile before you start judging.  A video is but one myopic view of a situation and may not tell an entire story.  You know nothing about what your talking about.</p>

		<p>Sherylnne:<br />
You are absolutely CLUELESS!   You can sit there and say you saw and heard both sides?  You have got to be kidding&#8230;Did you hear any of the deputies version of what happened,  did you happen to see the whole video?  Many parts are missing..It has been cut and pasted or whatever you want to call it, this is not the whole video, look at it again it is missing many parts, But you think you saw and heard everything from both sides,  you are flippin clueless&#8230;and then you think you are judge and jury with your limited knowledge&#8230;this is why our whole country is in the mess it is&#8230;</p>

		<p>After reading these posts, I have come to the conclusion that there are a lot of cops on here  trying to justify thug behavior.  I&#8217;m not buying it.  The video speaks for itself.  And, whoever thinks you don&#8217;t have a right to know why you are being questioned or arrested, is a moron.  For you, take your own advice and get your rights trampled on.  But, don&#8217;t try to make the rest of us willing victims.  If the cops have &#8220;cause&#8221; for action, the victim has a right to know. The law doesn&#8217;t give the cops the right to purposely impose extreme pain on a cooperative suspect, dislocate his shoulder, refuse to help him while shackled to exit a squad car, purposely step on the chain to inflict pain on the cuffs on his ankles, and then threaten to shoot him.  This is not a third world country.  This is a civilized nation with laws to be abided by for  both the citizen and the cops.  In deference to the cops belief, they are NOT above the law.  If you don&#8217;t have the courage to do the job the right way and within the law, then take your bully tactics and  find a namby-pamby job where you can bully and get paid back.  I wouldn&#8217;t mind hearing your screams of pain.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Please, if he meant SEARCH him real good he would have said just that SEARCH HIM REAL GOOD-not GET HIM REAL GOOD.&#8221;</p>
<p>Been there done that. No subject/suspect  handcuffed or not gets into the back seat of a unit until he/she is searched again real good by deputy/officer doing the transporting.<br />
Key word for jury here is interpretation, remember   Hergesheimer said that after being told the suspect had already been searched.</p>

		<p>Yep. The reserve Deputy was clearly working a transportation assignment. As such he is responsible for searching the prisoner, again, prior to transporting.</p>

		<p>True story.  7/28/09.  Laguna Niguel.  Traveling south on Niguel Road mid-morning.  Motorcycle cop pulled around a car behind and in the lane next to mine to get behind me and put the siren and lights on to pull me over.  It was just north of Marina Hills.  I am a 64 year old woman driving a moderately-priced late model vehicle.  The car in front of me and the two in the lane next to me were upscale brands, driven by men.  The officer pulled out of the side street and manuevered to get to me.  Anyway, I immediately navigated to the curb.  After handing him my drivers license, registration and insurance, the officer asked if I knew why he was stopping me.  I did not and told him so.  He stated I was speeding.  I told him I didn&#8217;t think so since I was in keeping with the traffic in front and to the side of me.  He stated I was going 51!!  He then asked if I knew what the speed limit was.  I looked out my windshield  and pointed to the speed limit sign posted directly in front of me, which read  &#8220;50.&#8221;  Without saying anything, I pointed to it as I looked at him.  He claimed he &#8220;got me&#8221; north of Marina Hills and the speed limit there is 40.  When I asked exactly where &#8220;got me&#8221; and if he could please show me the proof since all 4 cars (mine and the other 3 were traveling at the same rate of speed) he said he didn&#8217;t have any to show me.  Where he was positioned on the side street, there is no way he could have since it is a hill leading up to Marina Hills.   As he handed me the ticket, he stated he &#8220;had a family to feed.&#8221;  So there ya go.  He targets an old lady who appears to be the person who would offer the least resistance and &#8220;apologizes&#8221; for having to feed his family.  The Laguna Niguel Police Force at its finest.

		<p>As he handed me the ticket, he stated he “had a family to feed.” So there ya go. He targets an old lady who appears to be the person who would offer the least resistance and “apologizes” for having to feed his family. The Laguna Niguel Police Force at its finest. At least, he didn’t dislocate my shoulder or threaten to shoot me. His mother must be proud.</p>

Hey Sherylynne &#8211; didn&#8217;t you hear??</p>
<p>&#8230;ALL you have to do is be 1) polite to the occifer and he will let you go with just  a &#8220;warning&#8221;!!!!!</p>
<p>No really, all the cops on here say that is true-if YOU are polite they NEVER write YOU up-it is only the ones who are NOT polite that get the tickets-according to all the occifers here anyway <img src='http://taxdollars.ocregister.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

		<p>Your comment about him saying he had a family to feed makes no sense at all, when officers do not get compensated for writing tickets. The city itself gets a very small percentage of any traffic citation fees.</p>

		<p>30 years on this planet, never once been put in a situation to have to answer questions from a cop or be considered suspicious by a cop.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a very easy life.</p>
<p>This guy is a loser and deserves everything he&#8217;s getting.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t want problems?  Don&#8217;t put yourself in this situation.</p>
<p>2 major points here.  bi-polar and possessing 3 knives.  bad combination.  I&#8217;d be on the defensive too.</p>

		<p>You are all liars that is not what the DA or Judge determined so f what you think…its not your mind to make the decisions you obviously have no respect for the Victim Mr. Radwan and Especially you have No consideration nor respect towards The Honorable Judge!</p>
<p>2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>

		<p>This guy is a total tool. He thinks he is better than everyone else. I do know him personally. The OC Register should learn to be objective. There is really no point in showing part of the video where the officer gets lost. Officers do not know every street in the county. Navigating the streets looking for landmarks or other known objects at night is hard enough. Then there is the statement of &#8220;I&#8217;ll get him good.&#8221;, the officer is obviously talking about searching the suspect again prior to putting him in his patrol. It is the officer&#8217;s own safety that is going to be put into jeopardy if the suspect still has weapons hidden on him. Rightfully so the officer is going to search him again &#8220;good&#8221;. Then there is the tasering&#8230; you can obviously hear the rear car doors opening up, while the officer searches the back seat quick to make sure there is nothing for the suspect to get his hands on, and then that is when the suspect is &#8220;pulled off&#8221; the car to be taken to the back of the car to be put in the back seat. Radwan can be heard resisting arrest and not listening to the officers when they are taking him to the back of the car and then he gets tased. Anyone can walk with a 1 foot chain between their legs&#8230; it is called baby steps. Then he has to complain about it like a baby. </p>
<p>The OC Register just likes to bash the police at any chance they can get. I feel very sad for the reporters that they feel they need to get their name on another poorly written article by bashing the police every other day.</p>

		<p>You are nothing but an apologist for the inexcusable.The video does not lie.I don&#8217;t support the mistreatment of anyone, even if you think he&#8217;s a tool.Law enforcement needs to do some housecleaning to get rid of the bad apples.</p>

		<p>Your only fiction……</p>
<p>Here is the Fact!!</p>
<p>2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>

		<p>The reason that Orange County hasn&#8217;t become like Los Angeles in terms of widespread crimes is because our local Law Enforcement takes a pro-active attitude towards dealing with the &#8220;bad guys&#8221;. Some people really need to step out from behind their gated communities and get a dose of what goes on in areas outside of their &#8220;little world&#8221;. We pay the police to take of the problems that we don&#8217;t want to deal with and sometime things can get ugly fast; look at recent murder of Officer Ryan Bonaminio in Riverside. The world has a lot of wicked people in it who wouldn&#8217;t think twice about hurting you if they could get away with it, so please support our police and military.</p>

		<p>Wow, where is the excessive force.  It is clear he was pushing back with his head as the deputy was controlling him and when he let up on the pressure his head went down on the hood.  That is perfectly clear and I don&#8217;t know how anyone could see anything else.</p>
<p>He is under arrest and all arestees will be searched.  Would you want the officer to put some one in the back seat of his car that might have weapons on him.  No way.  He was clearly resisting the entire time he was being searched.  When a person is arrested he has to obey the officers commands.  This BI-POLAR individual did not obey any commands the officers gave.</p>
<p>At the jail he had the opportunity to walk but he clearly want to drop his body weight and refuse to walk.  He was then carried into the jail.  The body dropping and child-like behavior all fall in line with a BI-POLAR behavior.  He actually did less complaining while being carried in.</p>
<p>They laid him on the floor and did a methodical search, giving him clear commands all the way through the search process.  </p>
<p>The officers showed professionalism and restraint during the whole process and the defendant will get nothing in court.  </p>
<p>The register however, has once again given a slanted and very twisted view of the video.  The register is truly prejudiced against the Orange County Sheriffs&#8217; Department.  The register, what a rag.</p>

		<p>The questions are absolutly stupid.  How about<br />
1) The officers did use excessive force?<br />
2) The officers did not use excesive force?<br />
3) Could not tell form the video if the officers used excessive force.</p>
<p>The register is one of the worst paper going.  The questions they posed are so slanted it is ridiculous.</p>

		<p>2.2.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The Court again turns to the Graham factors in analyzing the need for the force. Again, these factors strongly favor finding excessive force.</p>
<p>The first factor, the severity of the crimes at issue, weighs against a finding of excessive force. The analysis here is the same as it was in Section 2.1.2.</p>
<p>The second factor, whether Plaintiff posed a threat to officers or bystanders, strongly favors finding excessive force. Plaintiff was in handcuffs and leg irons, and he was surrounded by multiple police officers. Like in the analysis for the first excessive force incident, Defendants contend Plaintiff was resisting and kicking his legs, and Plaintiff denies such conduct. Further like the first incident, the video evidence is inconclusive concerning whether Plaintiff was actually resisting. Thus, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, Plaintiff posed very little threat to any officers or bystanders. See Davis, 478 F.3d at 1055-56.</p>
<p>The third factor, whether Plaintiff was resisting or posed a flight risk, also strongly favors finding excessive force. Again, the video evidence is inconclusive concerning whether Plaintiff was resisting, so the Court must accept Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the events, where he was not resisting. And Plaintiff posed no flight risk since he was in restraints and surrounded by police officers.</p>
<p>On balance, the Graham factors (and thus the need for the force) strongly favor finding excessive force.</p>

		<p>Facts from the judge<br />
2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>

		<p>Sta18veteran, you are so full of it bringing the murder of a PO into a disccussion of a video that clearly shows crimminal acts being done to a citizen. </p>
<p>   There is no one that wants to see cops killed at work, but there sure seems to be many cops and cop toadies that have no problem killing citizens or permantely maiming one, and then declaring that the deserved it!!! <img src='http://taxdollars.ocregister.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

		<p>Hey Pat, a citizens life is not about dollars you fool. The Constitution does not allow the state to torture and kill citizens because they may comment on the way they are being molested by state agents with guns.</p>

		<p>Any one that is siding with the cops on this is a complete moron. Watch the video and you&#8217;ll see the truth . These cops are running around arresting gang members when in all reality they are the largest most corrupt group of gang members in this country . You want to talk about organized crime you have it right here in front of you people , these bullies think they are above the law , untouchable ! Open your goddamn eyes people this  is what is going on all around you , and any  one that is agreeing with the cops has never been in that position or you are one of them committing these crimes hiding behind the badge thinking it gives you an authority that you don&#8217;t have . This man is a tax payer he is the one they are supposed to be protecting , he pays these morons wages and for anyone that sits here and agrees with what these scumbag officers did the night was the right thing watch the video again and put yourself in Mr .Radwan shoes and imagine the pain he endured that night and then tell me you agree with  what went on . No one that had felt his pain would agree with the officers that night and the only ones on here that are agreeing are probably those same piece of crap officers trying to save there own ass by posting derogatory statements against the real victim  in all this , and the victim is Mr Radwan . Peace and God bless all of you goodnight</p>

		<p>Well, we are 100% in agreement on this one.I worry,as I know you do , about police excess.I will never forget about the H.B. murder at the hands of the cops of the MacDonald girl.That case haunts me to this day.And to think that those cops walk free today is an insult to justice.</p>

		<p>Joshua</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what you wanted the deputies to do?  You were verbally hostile, you challenged them to fight and you and were physically uncooperative&#8230;</p>
<p>Should they have removed your cuffs?  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate, but sometimes people have to be physically controlled!  Seems to me the deputies were very methodical in searching you taking you to jail, then removing your clothes (for your safety) until you sobered up (or calmed down).</p>
<p>A suggestion for those of you who cant watch this video, grow up!    Joshua needed to be dealt with, that&#8217;s why the police were called in the first place.</p>
<p>Joshua,  I suggest you get on a regular routine with your medication!  </p>
<p>OCR another fine job of trying to make LE look like the bad guys!</p>

<p>With Plaintiff victim Radwan the Federal Judge Denied Motion of Summary Judgement so you better cease and desist. Keep Trying To Slander the Plaintiff. Keep on Addressing Mr. Radwan the Victim this is clearly intimidating a victim witness. And threaten the News again please! And those 6 out of 9 are really getting Royal Treatment. Also why dont you Address the victim plaintiff  Mr. Radwan with the bully attitude of a non-professional LE. I think you need not step anymore boundaries with that badge number</p>

		<p>2.2.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The Court again turns to the Graham factors in analyzing the need for the force. Again, these factors strongly favor finding excessive force.</p>
<p>The first factor, the severity of the crimes at issue, weighs against a finding of excessive force. The analysis here is the same as it was in Section 2.1.2.</p>
<p>The second factor, whether Plaintiff posed a threat to officers or bystanders, strongly favors finding excessive force. Plaintiff was in handcuffs and leg irons, and he was surrounded by multiple police officers. Like in the analysis for the first excessive force incident, Defendants contend Plaintiff was resisting and kicking his legs, and Plaintiff denies such conduct. Further like the first incident, the video evidence is inconclusive concerning whether Plaintiff was actually resisting. Thus, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, Plaintiff posed very little threat to any officers or bystanders. See Davis, 478 F.3d at 1055-56.</p>
<p>The third factor, whether Plaintiff was resisting or posed a flight risk, also strongly favors finding excessive force. Again, the video evidence is inconclusive concerning whether Plaintiff was resisting, so the Court must accept Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the events, where he was not resisting. And Plaintiff posed no flight risk since he was in restraints and surrounded by police officers.</p>
<p>On balance, the Graham factors (and thus the need for the force) strongly favor finding excessive force.<br />
2.3 The Use of Force in the Medical Observation Cell</p>
<p>The third incident is the use of the force in the medical observation cell. The Court finds that, under Plaintiff&#8217;s version of the facts, this force was not reasonable.</p>
<p>2.3.1 The Severity of the Force</p>
<p>The use of force in the medical observation cell incident was moderate when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. Plaintiff was still unable to walk due to the pain from his leg restraints, and the officers refused to loosen the restraints. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:15-11:25.) The officers lifted Plaintiff by holding his arms backwards behind him and holding the chain of the leg restraints that were hurting him. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 11:25-12:16.) Then an officer stood on the chains of Plaintiff&#8217;s leg irons, and other officers twisted Plaintiff&#8217;s arms and pinned Plaintiff&#8217;s legs, all of which caused him pain. (Plaintiff&#8217;s Exhibit G 12:16-18:30; Radwan Decl. ¶¶ 95-101.) This use of force was moderate.</p>
<p>2.3.2 The Need for the Force</p>
<p>The analysis for the second factor, the need for the force, is similar to the analysis in Section 2.2.2. The crime at issue weighs against finding excessive force. But the threat posed by Plaintiff and whether he was resisting or a flight risk weigh very strongly in favor of finding excessive force. Thus, this factor strongly favors finding excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.3 The Balance of the Force Used against the Need</p>
<p>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, there was a moderate use of force but only a minimal need for the force. The balance of these interests supports a finding of excessive force.</p>
<p>2.3.4 Conclusion</p>
<p>The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff supports a finding of excessive force. Further, this constitutional violation was clearly established at the time of the incident, and no reasonable officer would have believed the use of force to be constitutional. See Palmer, 9 F.3d at 1434-36.</p>
<p>The Individual Defendants also argue that Essoe, Fouste, Prince, Hilliard, Kunar, Hergesheimer, and Kurimay are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not personally participate in the use of force during this incident. (Defendants&#8217; Chart 50:19-51:1.) The Court agrees, and summary adjudication is GRANTED as to these Defendants. But as to Garcia, Hernandez, Padilla, and Foster, who personally participated in this incident, summary adjudication is DENIED.</p>

		<p>It is  people with your mentality that make the system as bad as it is . You  speak about something you know nothing about , and are you a doctor ? What makes you qualified to be giving Joshua your advice to exactly how he should be taking his medications , you are assuming for one that he is even prescribed medication. So really until you really know all the facts you should really just keep your ingonant non factual comments to yourself , bc we can read right through your slandering of the victims character. But since we are all doing our fair share of assuming around here on this  blog I&#8217;m going to assume these sheriffs are going to all be in need  of surgery here very shortly to have you removed from their asses. From my understanding which i am speaking about facts that can be proven , joshua is a man of God and he has devoted his entire adult life to helping the environment , putting his own life in jeoporty to save the life of a complete stranger with never a moment of hesitation , he teaches as a professor for the King of  Saudi Arabia at his university , he has won a Medal of Valor from the state of Calif. If you google his name under google scholar you will find the victim there , something that a very small percentage of the entire population can say for themselves as can Mr Radwan . And the list goes on and on for which this man has done to help the community. So with just the few facts I just spoke about i would want an entire community full of people like the victim Mr Radwan . If everyone was more like the victim we as a society would not have the need for police officers period and definitely not officers  like these scumbags that are patrolling our streets . We live in this country so we do have rights , Mr Radwan was only asking why his rights were being violated as per his , your ,and my 4 th admendment right . He had every right in the world to be upset as which would   any citizen of this country would be if their rights were violated and removed at the decretion of a few gung ho  officers . So i ask anyone reading my post remove yourself from your world as you see it through your eyes and put yourself in his place before you comment on this sensitive subject or before making your final opinion in this case. Thanks for taking time out of your life to read my post .God Bless all of you and I will pray that nobody needs to ever suffer like this man of God had to that christmas eve night five years ago . But with the fact that all these officers are still patrolling our streets the threat of this happening to anyone of us still exsists. Pretty scary thing when your more concerned with getting pulled over by a sheriff then getting car jacked by some thug gangbanger as I am . Peace and God Bless and have a goodnight</p>

		<p>hmmm I think this should be resolved in the court room.  the current venue seems to biased against LE.  that means you OCR.  why do you always try to poison the jury pool before the case is concluded in the court room.  shame on you.  YOU RARELY PUBLISH THE MANY CASES THAT ARE DECIDED IN FAVOR OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.   and I bet when this one is decided in favor of the cops there won&#8217;t be a word printed about it.</p>

		<p>While I am no fan of the OC Sheriff&#8217;s Dept or law enforcement in general, I think the register has compromised its impartiality (as seems to be the case all too often anymore) by referring to the incident as an &#8220;assault&#8221; in the print edition of the article (Nov 12, 2010, Local p1).  The use of this term implies criminal culpability on behalf of the dupties involved.</p>
<p>Secondly, I went to high school with this individual over a decade ago and it appears not much has changed.  Lets just say he alledgedly has a problem with authority and it was rumored that he was kicked out of the school I was attending for attempting to fight a teacher during Saturday school.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, he likely got exactly what he deserved.</p>

		<p>Attorney@Law, Tiny Tim, Joshua Radwan or whatever name you choose to respond with, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to call someone illiterate who has typed a clear and coherent message, it just doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>In addition, you should probably not call a person illiterate through this word vomit: &#8220;live an illiterate life what are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>You sound like Yoda, but without  the insight and with a learning disability.</p>

		<p>The use of this term implies criminal culpability on behalf of the dupties involved.</p>
<p>==========<br />
No it does not imply that.</p>
<p>Assault is a civil and criminal term, and there are civil and criminal remedies for it.</p>

		<p>It seems like the police officers did what was necessary.  They were calm, Joshua was not.  They gave clear directions, Joshua responded with taunts.  Joshua needed to be restrained so that&#8217;s what the cops did.  </p>
<p>Did they use excessive force? By making him walk? By pushing his head back down on the hood of the car when he would not do it on his own?  Give me a break.  Please don&#8217;t waste my tax dollars by giving this irreverent @$$hole a voice in the courtroom.</p>

		<p>These officers are no better than street thugs. What do you expect when the police departments hire people with minimal education (High school grad or GED) and give them a badge and a gun and a patrol car. Not only that, but their actions are so disgusting that you see these officers have no sense of moral compass.</p>
<p> I hope this happens to their children.  What goes around comes around.</p>

		<p>Sam Habibi,</p>
<p>Please! Keep your hopes like what you hope will happen to their children to yourself. </p>
<p>Actually I really Disagree with that last line where you try and caste a spell over their young innocent children that have absolutely nothing to do with their actions towards me.</p>
<p>I am totally against these Deputies but in no way shape nor form shall any woman or children be brought into this regardless of how awful the parents are!</p>
<p>I do not tolerate such wickedness toward innocent children regardless of who they are related to! I would appreciate if you renunciate that last line pertaining towards their children&#8217;s future and karma!</p>
<p>Joshua Radwan<br />

		<p>I tried to commit suicide about five years ago.  My wife called the police and they came pounding at my door.  I left out the backdoor and ran away.  I spent the next half-hour hiding in a corner a few blocks away.  When I came back, there were multiple cars in front of my house with lights flashing and all the neighbors out.  They rushed me and handcuffed me and put me in the back of a squad car.  They told me I was a wimp and that I could never show my face in my neighborhood again.  They told me I was a disgrace.  When I reached the hospital, I asked one of the less critical deputies why the others were so angry.  He said it was because they had to spend so much time waiting for me to come back.  In the report, they said they chased me all over the neighborhood when in fact, I was hiding in a corner and they were waiting in front of my house.  Shortly after, I was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder.  Afterwards, I only left the house for doctors appointments for several months.  I did feel disgraced and the officers&#8217; words that I could never show my face in my neighborhood again echoes through my mind to this day.  My neighbors are all still good friends of mine and nobody treats me differently.  They&#8217;re just happy I got help.  I don&#8217;t think the officers understood any of it.  I don&#8217;t think they understand mental illness.  I think they believe were are all just disgraceful wimps.  I&#8217;m sorry Joshua had an even worse experience.  I hope he can heal.</p>

		<p>Disgusting.  But unfortunately as long as we continue to recruit the dregs of society and turn them loose on the streets with a badge, a gun, and little or no accountability, this will continue to happen.  What we need is to seriously downsize law enforcement to a smaller group of better quality individuals AND begin to elect DAs who have the guts to go after the rogues.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not a crime to mouth off an officer (read the case law), it&#8217;s a crime to use excessive force. So ironically the only ones committing crimes in this video are the police. Ironic but ever so common. Ask Oscar Grant and all the others who have been victimized by the police. Joshua, I hope you win and I hope the men who did this to you are stripped of their badges.</p>

		<p>All the comments that compare this incident to Oscar Grant, Rodney King, torture, or making crazy-a$$ connections to Nazism are dishonoring the memory and making light of the pain of people who have really suffered.  That is Pure Disgust.  Trying to put Josh Radwan&#8217;s name alongside these people is not only inaccurate, it is extremely disrespectful.  Radwan, get back your in Range Rover drive home to the mansion your parents bought  for you and get  your boo boo bunny out of the freezer.  I bet Oscar Grant would have kicked your ass.</p>

		<p>I have no connections to the OCSD or any type of law enforcement.  I&#8217;m pretty neutral on the debate of law enforcement.  I just see trend in comparing mundane events to catastrophes.  It&#8217;s irrational, much like this entire case. </p>
<p>“I made the decision to bring a lawsuit against these deputies while they were using their Taser on me,” Radwan said.</p>
<p>It is clear in the video that Radwan decided before the taser was used on him that he was going to sue.  This makes me question if any of Radwan&#8217;s statements are reliable.  He seems to be out to prove some sort point or get some sort of notoriety.  Rewarding him a monetary settlement means he&#8217;s getting my tax dollars and I would rather not have some knife-wielding-nunchakus-restraining order pot smoking kid get it.  Even if he wants to put it toward mental health services, I would rather he doesn&#8217;t get to decide what to do with our money.</p>
<p>I think a more practical solution is to give Radwan a kleenex. He doesn&#8217;t need hundreds of thousands of our dollars to dry his tears.  Radwan, you were taunting and hostile to the people who were called in to protect your girlfriend.  Man up, take responsibility for your actions, and stop wasting our time and our dollars.</p>

		<p>In reading about the cause for this arrest &#8211; it seems as though the accusations were not well founded.  Hear-say by a witness that saw a lovers quarrel and then the male kicked the tire of his car?  Look out, that means arrest in this here town!  Not only arrest, but, ripping arms out of the sockets, breaking eye glasses against the hood of the car, torchering the legs by chaining the ankles together and then telling the person to walk?   I don&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>It just seems to bare witness to &#8211; too many cops with built up anger bursting out and causing these unethical actions.  Remember, these are the police men that we teach our children to look up to.  They are safeguarding humanity.  This sort of action is actually inhumane and uncalled for.  Mr Radwan was not an uncooperative menace to society.</p>

		<p>Orange County sheriff are thugs with authority.  Abuse of power is the mainstay in EVERYTHING they do with this case being just the tip of the iceberg. Thank you OC Register for keeping them in check as someone needs too.</p>

		<p>What&#8217;s needed is Civilian oversight of the Sheriff&#8217;s Dept.  Disband the ineffective Sheriff&#8217; Dept&#8217;s Internal Affairs section and have trained objective civilians do the investigation of any wrong doing.  This would save OC taxpayers millions of tax dollars in lawsuits.</p>

		<p>I went to Jr. High (Westminster Christian School) with that POS Jarrett Kurimay.  I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll pull the born again Christian defense that &#8220;he&#8217;s not perfect, just forgiven&#8221; crap and have his megachurch pastor little brother Danny to cover for him.  Real &#8220;Christian&#8221; people these Kurimays are!  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m more afraid of power tripping armed cops than I am criminals.  Nowadays,  I can&#8217;t tell the difference between the two.</p>

		<p>NO POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN BE EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH<br />
EVERY KIND OF &#8220;DOSORDER&#8221;. THESE ARE NOT MENTAL HEALTH<br />
PROFFESIONALS. LIFE IS SIMPLE. SHUT YOUR YAP. SAY YES<br />
SIR AND NO SIR, OR MAM, FOLLOW BASIC &#8220;POLITE&#8221; RULES.<br />
TOO BAD FOR THIS GUY, BUT HE BROUGHT IT ALL ON HIMSELF.<br />
IF YOU DRIVE A RANGE ROVER AND HAVE A GIRLFRIEND YOU<br />
SHOULDN&#8217;T BE OUT IN A PARKING LOT &#8220;ARGUING WITH YOUR<br />
GIRLFRIEND&#8221; OR ANYTHING ELSE TO ATTRACT ATTENTION.<br />
IT SIMPLY DEMONSTRATES THAT YOU HAVE NO CONCERN FOR<br />
ANY ONE OR ANY THING BUT YOURSELF.</p>
