<center><b><u>HOW TO HELP FREE MARC EMERY:</u></b></p>
<p>Download the NEW "Free Marc Emery" information handout!<br />
<a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/files/FreeMarcEmeryHandoutFront.jpg">Front page</a><br />
<a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/files/FreeMarcEmeryHandoutBack.jpg">Back page</a></p>
<p>Download the NEW "Free Marc Emery" petition!<br />
<a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/files/MarcEmeryTransferPETITION.pdf">PDF file</a></center></p>
<p><b>First of all and most importantly, please be polite and respectful – but very firm – when contacting the following people. </b></p>
<p>Secondly, strongly emphasize that Marc Emery is a Canadian citizen who never went to the USA and carried out his activities in Canada. If he has broken the law in Canada, he should be tried and sentenced in Canada, not sent to a foreign country to be punished under much harsher laws. </p>
<p>Try to bring up these important points along with the "Facts About Marc Emery" (listed further below) to help you better explain why Marc Emery should not be imprisoned in the USA:</p>
<blockquote><p>a) Vancouver police investigated Marc in 2003 and tried to have charges filed in court, but the Crown refused, so the VPD admitted that the USA picked up the file to get harsh punishment for Marc in the USA. The Vancouver police worked with Americans on Canadian soil to create the US case. If Marc couldn't be charged in Canada, he should not be charged in America.</p>
<p>b) The US District Attorney arranged a plea deal in January 2008 that would allow Marc to serve his time in Canada, as long as the Conservative government laid charges here in Canada, but the government refused. Again, if the government wouldn't charge or punish Marc in Canada, he should not be charged or punished in America.</p></blockquote>
<p><BR><BR></p>
<p><b>1) Contact your Member of Parliament in Canada or your Representative in the US Congress. Let them know about Marc Emery’s situation, and why you and thousands of other voters want Marc to be free in his home country Canada. </b></p>
<blockquote><p>Don't be afraid or nervous about meeting your representative! They are paid with <i>your</i> money to represent you, and their job is to listen to you and take your concerns to Parliament/Congress. </p>
<p>Canadians: Meeting your Member of Parliament is something you should do not just for Marc, but also for the future of Canada (you should express concern about the "tough-on-crime" drug laws, like Bill S-10). Your Member of Parliament is in town every weekend to meet local voters, and that includes you -- so make sure you get your voice heard amongst the anti-marijuana advocates who are visiting their MPs! <a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/2010/05/21/Free-Marc-Occupations-Call-Drug-Peace-Conservative-Culture-War">Click here</a> for coverage of the Conservative MP office protest/occupations taking place across Canada!</p>

<p><b><u>DEA admits Marc Emery's extradition is ALL about politics and activism</u></b></p>
<p>The US Drug Enforcement Administration admitted on the day of Marc Emery's arrest that his investigation and extradition were politically motivated, designed to target the Marijuana Legalization organization that Emery spearheaded and ran for over a decade in Canada.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/files/Tandystatement.jpg" target="new"><img src="http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/files/Tandystatement.jpg" width="600"></a><br />
<i>Large image of Karen Tandy Statement: <a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/files/Tandystatement.jpg" target="new">here</a></i></p>
<p>Here is the original text of DEA Administrator Karen Tandy's statement released on July 29th, 2005:</p>
<p><b>Today's DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery, publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine, and the founder of a marijuana legalization group -- is a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada, but also to the marijuana legalization movement.</p>
<p>His marijuana trade and propagandist marijuana magazine have generated nearly $5 million a year in profits that bolstered his trafficking efforts, but those have gone up in smoke today.</p>
<p>Emery and his organization had been designated as one of the Attorney General's most wanted international drug trafficking organizational targets -- one of only 46 in the world and the only one from Canada.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery's illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canada. Drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on.</b></p>
<p><br><br />
<hr><br />
<br></p>
<p>Canadian Marc Emery has been fighting extradition to the USA and possible life imprisonment since July 2005. In March 2008, the Canadian Government decided to turn down a unique type of <a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/5177.html" target="new">plea deal</a> the USA and Marc Emery's lawyer had arranged -- one that required Canadian charges to be laid and the incarceration be in Canada.</p>
<p>In July 2009, Marc's co-accused, Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams, were sentenced to 2 years probation in Canada because Marc had agreed to take a plea deal. In early September 2009, Marc Emery signed a plea deal for a 5-year sentence in the US federal prison system, which was the only way to avoid the possibility of a mandatory minimum 30 years and up to life in prison. You can read Marc's reasons for taking the plea deal in his blog post <a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/node/18283" target="new">"Why I'm Cutting a Deal"</a>.<br />

<p><u><b>FACTS ABOUT MARC EMERY:</b></u></p>
<p>• Marc Emery is a Canadian citizen who never went to the USA as a seed seller.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery operated his seed business in Canada at all times, with no American branches or employees.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery declared his income from marijuana seed sales on his income tax, and paid over $580,000 to the Federal and Provincial governments from 1999 to 2005.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery is the leader of the British Columbia Marijuana Party, a registered political party that has regularly participated in elections.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery has never been arrested or convicted of manufacturing or distributing marijuana in Canada, as he only sold seeds.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery gave away all of the profits from his seed business to drug law reform lobbyists, political parties, global protests and rallies, court litigation, medical marijuana initiatives, drug rehabilitation clinics, and other legitimate legal activities and organizations.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery helped found the United States Marijuana Party, state-level political parties, and international political parties in countries such as Israel and New Zealand.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery has been known as a book seller and activist in Canada for 30 years, fighting against censorship laws and other social issues long before he became a drug law reform activist.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery has been a media figure for 20 years with regards to marijuana and drug law reform. He is very well-known to Canadian, American and international news media organizations.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery operated his business in full transparency and honesty since its inception in 1994, even sending his marijuana seed catalogue inside his magazine "Cannabis Culture" to each Member of Parliament in Canada every two months for years.</p>
<p>• The US Drug Enforcement Administration admitted in a press release from Administrator Karen Tandy that his July 29th, 2005 arrest was based on drug legalization efforts -- a copy of the document can be viewed at <a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/4685.html" title="http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/4685.html">http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/4685.html</a> -- </p>
<blockquote><p><i>"Today's DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery, publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine, and the founder of a marijuana legalization group -- is a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada, but also to the marijuana legalization movement. </p>
<p>His marijuana trade and propagandist marijuana magazine have generated nearly $5 million a year in profits that bolstered his trafficking efforts, but those have gone up in smoke today. </p>
<p>Emery and his organization had been designated as one of the Attorney General's most wanted international drug trafficking organizational targets -- one of only 46 in the world and the only one from Canada. </p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery's illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canada. Drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on."</i></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="inline inline-right"><img src="http://cannabisculture.com/v2/files/images/MarcEmeryPhotoFramed-.jpg" alt="" title=""  class="image image-_original " width="203" height="300" /></span><b><u>Who is Marc Emery?</u></b></p>
<p>Marc Emery is a Canadian businessman and political activist who owns and operates "Cannabis Culture Magazine", "Pot-TV", the "BC Marijuana Party", and "Marc Emery's Cannabis Culture Headquarters" (previously "BC Marijuana Party Bookstore" and "Hemp BC" before that). Marc also ran "Emery Direct Seeds" in a store in downtown Vancouver BC and through mail-order, for over ten years, with the goal to fund anti-prohibition and pro-marijuana activists and organizations across North America and the world -- a fact that DEA Administrator Karen Tandy crowed about in the press release about Marc Emery's arrest. (Numerous other seed-selling businesses operate in North America, some even on the same block as Marc Emery's businesses today, but they are not seen as high-profile activists, so they are not targeted by the United States Government and law enforcement.) </p>
<p>Marc paid provincial and federal taxes on his income, had no business outlets in the USA, and never went to the USA to conduct seed transactions. Everything was done openly and transparently, because Marc has always been honest and vocal. He's a political party leader and media magnet, always happy to explain how and why he did everything. He spent the proceeds from all sales on ending the drug war in Canada, the USA, and all over the world: he financed numerous political parties, ballot initiatives, election campaigns, court challenges, medical programs, drug treatment centres, legal fees, conferences, organizations, events and more. That's what his mission was, and he even ran in provincial and municipal elections five times as a seed seller, gaining many votes and endless media coverage. </p>
<p>Marc Emery had two employees that worked for his seed business: Michelle Rainey, and Greg Williams. Together they were called "The BC3" in earlier "No Extradition" efforts. They, along with Marc, are Canadian citizens who were heavily involved in Canadian and American anti-prohibition activism for over ten years, though they remained in Canada at all times. </p>
<p>The US Justice Department wanted to have the BC3 extradited to the USA to be charged with conspiracy to produce marijuana, conspiracy to traffic marijuana, and conspiracy to launder the proceeds of crime. ("Marc Emery Direct Seeds" was a marijuana seed business; the accused never sold any marijuana. The DEA even went undercover and tried to buy ten pounds of pot from Marc Emery, but he gave them a lecture about how he sold seeds, not pot, and told the female undercover agent she was ignorant and reckless to ask him to sell marijuana, because he's never done it before and assumes he's always monitored by law enforcement.) </p>
<p>Because Marc Emery was so successful in fighting against the US-led War on Drugs, the powers in America decided to shut him up along with cooperation from Canadian law enforcement who wanted him punished more harshly than the monetary fine he received the last time he was arrested and convicted in Canada for selling seeds. The United States Justice Department and DEA had Canadian police help execute a raid and arrests for extradition of three political activists to face 10 years up to life in US prison. Greg and Michelle are now free, while Marc Emery still faces extradition the USA.</p>
<p><b><u>Did You Know?</u></b></p>
<p>• In Canada, there are three precedents for selling marijuana seeds in Canada -- and two of them were charged and convicted AFTER Marc Emery's 2005 arrest and US extradition request:</p>
<blockquote><p>1) In the year case R. v. Hunter in the year 2000, the BC Court of Appeals found that a $200 fine, not jail time, is the appropriate punishment for selling seeds. Ian Hunter was based in Victoria, BC. <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2000/2000bcca363/2000bcca363.html">Read the official decision here</a>.</p>
<p>2) On March 7th 2008, the BC Appeals Court released a decision that the punishment for selling cannabis seeds should not be more severe than one month in prison and one year of probation, the punishment handed to Daniel Kostantin, a marijuana seed retailer in BC who was selling to Americans. <a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/5170.html">Read about the decision here</a>.</p>
<p>3) In March 2010, Richard Baghdadlian of Heaven's Stairway seed company was sentenced to 2 years less a day to be served in the community (no prison time). He was busted in 2006 and found with gold bars and plenty of property and assets. He sold to Americans, advertised in High Times Magazine, and ran an enormously popular growing information website, Overgrow.com, which took its name from Marc Emery's famous slogan "Overgrow the Government". <a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/2010/03/03/Canadian-Seed-Seller-Avoids-Jail-Sentence">Read about the decision here</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>• Marc Emery, Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams never went to the United States. The seed business, "Marc Emery Direct Marijuana Seeds", was Canadian-based and run by Marc Emery. There were no US-based employees, and only regular mail was ever sent across the border from Vancouver, BC to Americans who made orders online or through the mail. </p>
<p>• According to a 2005 survey done by the Strategic Counsel &amp; Angus Reid Polling, <a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/5153.html" target="new">58% of Canadians oppose extradition in this case</a>. In the years since, public opposition to extradition has only grown, with national newspaper editorials, local news columnists, and even Members of Canada's Parliament all urging the Justice Minister to refuse extradition in this case.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery paid Income Tax to Revenue Canada and Revenue BC on all of his income generated from his seed business. He paid more than $500,000 in taxes between 1999 to 2005, and put his occupation on the income tax declarations as "marijuana seed vendor".</p>
<p>• Marc Emery's magazine "Cannabis Culture" was sent to every Member of Parliament for over 12 years. Every issue of Cannabis Culture up to #57 (the issue printed on the very same day as the raid, July 29th, 2005) included the entire seed catalogue in it, so Parliament knew about the business.</p>
<p>• Health Canada, when it first began licensing medical marijuana users, recommended to Members of Parliament and licensed users that new cannabis growers should purchase seeds online from Canadian seed sellers such as Marc Emery Direct. Svend Robinson, the New Democratic Party Health Critic in Canadian Parliament, will testify to that fact.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery brought a capitalist approach to the marijuana legalization movement by starting "radical retail" outlets such as Hemp BC, and got politically involved by helping organize the Canadian Marijuana Party and creating the BC Marijuana Party, the latter which he still leads today.</p>
<p>• Marc Emery created his seed business with the purpose of using the profits to fund the cannabis movement worldwide. Through the sale of cannabis seeds, Marc was able to finance numerous drug law reform groups and events around the world, mostly in Canada and the United States. He funded global rally/march promotion, American and Canadian ballot initiatives, election campaigns, lobbying groups, conferences, drug rehab clinics, class action lawsuits, protests, patient bills and bail fees, and more. In total, over $4,000,000 was contributed to various activities and organizations.</p>

<p>Tell him this! "The Justice Minister of Canada can deny or throw out the whole extradition at any time according to the Extradition Act!" Just take a look at it here: <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/E-23.01/bo-ga:l_2-gb:s_23?noCookie">Substitution and Amendment of Authority to Proceed</a>:</p>

(3) The Minister may at any time withdraw the authority to proceed and, if the Minister does so, the court shall discharge the person and set aside any order made respecting their judicial interim release or detention.</i><br />
And:<br />
<i>44. (1) The Minister shall refuse to make a surrender order if the Minister is satisfied that (a) the surrender would be unjust or oppressive having regard to all the relevant circumstances; or (b) the request for extradition is made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person by reason of their race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, language, colour, <b>political opinion</b>, sex, sexual orientation, age, mental or physical disability or status or that the person's position may be prejudiced for any of those reasons.</i></p>
<p>Political Opinion... Is that the motivation behind Marc Emery's persecution? Decide for yourself after reading what Karen Tandy, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (resigned late 2007), released on her DEA stationery on July 29th 2005, the day of Marc Emery's arrest:</p>
<p><i><b><u>Major North American Marijuana Trafficker and Self-Proclaimed "Prince of Pot" aka Marc Scott Emery Arrested Today.</u></b></p>
<p>"Today's DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery, publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine, and the founder of a marijuana legalization group, is a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the US and Canada, but also the marijuana legalization movement. His marijuana trade and propagandist marijuana magazine have generated nearly $5 million a year in profits that bolstered his trafficking efforts, but those have gone up in smoke today. Emery and his organization had been designated as one of the Attorney General's most wanted international drug trafficking organizational targets - one of only 46 in the world and the only one from Canada. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery's illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canada. Drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on." - Karen Tandy, DEA</i></p>

<p><center><img src="http://www.cannabisculture.com/library/images/uploads/4639-Message.jpg"><BR><BR><u><b>MARC EMERY:<br />
Who I Am, What I Was Doing, And Why I Did It</b></u></center></p>
<p>The following is an article by Marc Emery that appeared in <i>Cannabis Culture #58 (December/January 05/06)</i>. It explains his history as a political and social activist in Canada; his reasons to run Marc Emery Direct Marijuana Seeds; how he funded global cannabis activist organizations and formal marijuana initiatives and campaigns; and what the US Drug War's influence on Canada has caused. Updated information has been added where necessary.</p>
<p><b>July 29th, 2005... I had that 'life flashing before me' moment.</b> The frozen second in time when everything was sharp, clear, and signaled a great convergence of all my effort into this precise moment. <i>"Marc Emery, you are under arrest for Extradition to The United States of America..."</i> Every seed sold, all the millions of dollars I had given to the cause, every speech to free our people, every arrest, jailing and raid I had endured: it was all for this moment in time.<i> "...for trafficking in marijuana seeds, for the production of marijuana, and for money laundering."</i></p>
<p><b><u>How Did This Happen?</u></b></p>
<p>In 1990, when I became a cannabis activist, all books, magazines, videos, pipes, bongs, everything about marijuana was illegal in Canada. As a bookseller at the City Lights Bookshop in London, Ontario, I was surprised and shocked to learn that the Canadian government had banned High Times Magazine, had police seize all copies of marijuana growing books (including the Canadian classic Grow Yer Own Stone), and pushed over 500 "head" shops across Canada into shutting down. There was no cannabis activist movement left in Canada. No books, no magazines, no activists, no hemp stores. Nothing. The United States activist movement had itself become muted through the Reagan and Bush years.</p>
<p>Into this strange wilderness, I decided that as a bookseller I had to defy this peculiar censorship law, which eliminated disseminating the truth about marijuana - a law that passed almost unanimously in the Canadian Parliament in 1987, with one lone dissenter: NDP Member of Parliament Svend Robinson. In the fall of 1990, I ordered through the mail a few copies of The Emperor Wears No Clothes, the classic book by Jack Herer on the suppression of cannabis hemp. Not available in Canada because of the ban (section 462.2 of the Criminal Code, which provided up to 6 months in jail, and/or up to a $100,000 fine for distributing books and any printed matter about marijuana or any "illicit" drug), I imported copies (illegally) and bought newspaper ads in the London Free Press, my hometown daily, to announce that I was breaking the literature ban on marijuana and welcomed the local police to arrest me.</p>
<p>This approach had always worked well for me in the ten years leading up to this time, as I went to court and jail after deliberately breaking various laws, such as the Sunday shopping ban, obscenity laws, and other Canadian social control laws that I personally, through civil disobedience, helped change.</p>
<p><b><u>The Day It All Came Down</u></b></p>
<p><i>(Read the July 29th DEA release admitting the political motivation behind Marc Emery's arrest <a href="http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/4685.html">here</a>, and at the bottom of this page.)</i></p>
<p>On the day of my arrest on July 29, I was in the maritime province of Nova Scotia to speak at the Atlantic Hemp Festival held by Maritimers United for Medical Marijuana. While I was handcuffed and being delivered to the dank cells of the Halifax lock-up, Vancouver police raids were underway in my home, my offices, and the BCMP Bookstore in Vancouver. No marijuana or any drugs were found, and in fact, only approximately 5,000 seeds at most were available to be taken from the Seed Desk at the BCMP Bookstore. </p>
<p>Up to 50 police officers were used to comb the premises of all the locations. A battering ram was used to force the door at our office at 22 East Cordova Street. Various computers were taken, but little else was of interest to police. Warrants specified that any records relating to the seed business were to be seized. Presumably, police had access to phone records to calls made to Marc Emery Seeds. Otherwise, it wasn't a business where we kept records. We destroyed all information after sending out orders.</p>
<p><span class="inline inline-right"><img alt="July 29th 2006 protests begin outside" width="166" height="320" src="/library/images/uploads/4639-DEARaid.jpg"><span class="caption" style="width: 166px;"><strong>July 29th 2006 protests begin outside</strong></span></span>In my cell in the Halifax lock-up, I knew that my life had entered a critical and inevitable phase. I have always been very, very transparent in the way I have conducted a career I have often described as "revolutionary retail" or "capitalist activism". From the day I arrived in Vancouver on March 1st 1994, I was going to change the way marijuana activism existed. Even in 1994, everything about cannabis and used to enjoy cannabis was still illegal in Canada, and I was determined to make an aggressive change in this landscape.</p>
<p>Penniless after losing all of my money in an ill-advised house-building project in Indonesia, I arrived for the first time in my life in Vancouver, British Columbia, determined to build a movement that used a retail model to generate money that would feed a vast network of activism. Within days of getting off the plane, I was selling High Times magazine and a variety of banned marijuana grow books that had been fronted to me by a distributor. I sold door-to-door, to strangers on the street, to magazine stores, to bookstores, to students. I would make on average $1 profit per item, and fortunately, after 6 years of non-availability in Canada, there was a pent-up demand for marijuana information. </p>
<p>My two children, my spouse and I lived on $20 a day for food, and all other money was put back into these books and magazines. Within one year, I was distributing 2,000 copies a month of High Times magazine and was wholesaling and mail order retailing over 40 books about marijuana and other "illicit" entheogens. </p>
<p>After selling these products on the street for 3 months, I was offered a former Communist bookshop (that had been subject of a firebombing!) for $500 first month's rent. As long as I cleaned the heavily damaged building up, the landlord said my "hemp revolution business", as I explained it to him, was fine. On July 7, 1994, I opened the HEMP BC retail store and began a decade of principled, purposeful lawbreaking, with every action aimed at ending the marijuana prohibition by any peaceful means possible.</p>
<p><b><u>Everything Is On The Line</u></b></p>
<p>On July 29th, while the police were raiding the various places they believed seeds and records were stored, activists like David Malmo-Levine, Chris Bennett, Dana Larsen, and brave others protested the attack with a very noisy street demonstration. The media, informed immediately by Chris Bennett and the Cannabis Culture magazine team, descended on the scene at BCMP Headquarters. </p>
<p>Within hours, everyone in British Columbia was bombarded by media with the news that the US government was seeking to extradite me and two friends to the USA, for my seed-selling ways. It was clear the potential penalties were severe if I were to be extradited and prosecuted in the US, probably a life imprisonment. Under Drug Kingpin legislation in the United States, selling over 60,000 seeds qualifies for the death penalty. The manufacture or distribution of 60,000 kilograms of marijuana, 60,000 plants or 60,000 seeds all are included in death penalty provisions of the medieval law passed by a Newt Gingrich congress. I would be the first person who could qualify under this recent law to be executed for the activity I have clearly done with the tacit approval of everyone in Canada.</p>
<p>Revenue Canada received $578,000 in personal income taxes (1999 to 2005) on income that was explicitly from the sale of marijuana seeds, and they ALWAYS were aware of it. It said "Marijuana Seed Vendor" on my tax returns. I explained my entire banking and money systems and always gave income tax all access to my accounts so they could verify everything I said was true. I told them the Money Mart location where I cashed some money orders; my bank accounts were explained so they could track the flow of money. I relayed how expenses and disbursements took place in the incriminating world of seeds. They knew how it all worked because I had nothing to hide. The government of Canada received about $378,000 of this money; the provincial government of British Columbia received about $200,000.</p>
<p>As for politicians: every Member of Parliament in Canada, all 305, had a free subscription to our magazine, which often their assistants, if not the Member themselves, read and perused, for eight years. My seed catalogue was in every issue. They knew it was there. No one ever complained to me or to the police about it. Former MP Svend Robinson said that when he was New Democratic Party Health Critic he asked Health Canada where medical cannabis exemptees were supposed to obtain seeds. "Health Canada said to go to the internet and buy seeds there." And that's what he told medical patients to do: buy seeds on the internet. In fact, that's what Health Canada also told others in letters that we have from 2003.</p>
<p>NDP leader Jack Layton came to my home in November 2003 and did a beautiful interview on <a href="http://www.pot.tv/archive/shows/pottvshowse-2271.html">www.Pot.tv</a>. I think Jack Layton is a wonderful guy. I think NDP Justice Critic Libby Davies has done a sterling job. If I had any kind of reputation as a "drug dealer", do you think a man who is a serious contender for Prime Minister is going to some drug dealer's house to publicly ask for support? I was asked to testify before the Senate Subcommittee in both 1996 and 2002 as to my views on legalizing marijuana. Do you think they would ask any known drug dealer to attend? </p>
<p>When the Wall Street Journal put me on the front page of its massively influential newspaper in a very favorable article on Dec. 10, 1995, Quentin Hardy, the journalist who wrote it, told me six editors were assigned to check out my background. "They talked to your teachers, your neighbors, business associates, your parents. They are NOT going to let anyone with even a whiff of 'drug dealer' appear on that front page." Nine years later, Mr. Hardy came to British Columbia and wrote the definitive piece on the British Columbia marijuana industry for Forbes Magazine, and I personally introduced him to many in the industry while he did that piece.</p>
<p>I spoke at IDEA CITY in 2001 and 2003. I spoke on the same stage as former Prime Ministers John Turner and Kim Campbell, and I was the marijuana provider to many famous Canadians at the Friday Night IDEA CITY Party at muchmusic/CHUM TV. In my speeches I talked about the incredible work in helping 18 year old Webster Alexander in Alabama, having his sentence for selling two ounces of pot reduced from an unbelievable 36 years to one year served on weekends. I talked about the amazing work at my Iboga Therapy House (that seed money had kept operating), and how we helped heavily drug addicted persons for free with amazing results. I talked about my mission in life and how I had developed this "seed thing" that paid for immense amounts of activism. </p>
<p>My very transparent manifesto, "How to Overgrow the Government Through Revolutionary Retail" was published in the first issue of Cannabis Culture magazine. I was written up and covered in TIME Magazine, MacLean's Magazine, The Economist, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the New York Times, Rolling Stone, Seattle's Post Intelligencier, CBS' 60 Minutes, CNN, Mexico's La Reforma, The Times of India, and hundreds of other publications around the globe. I never received one letter from anyone in 10 years asking me to stop selling seeds. No one on the streets of Vancouver or anywhere in Canada where I have spoken extensively (22 cities in 2003, 19 cities in 2004) has ever approached me and said, "I don't like what you are doing by selling seeds". I have never received a letter or a phone call or correspondence of any kind from anyone in Canada asking or demanding that I stop the sale and distribution of seeds.</p>
<p>Since moving to BC over 11 years ago, I never owned vehicles, property, bonds, investments, assets, or off-shore accounts. I leased everything on a month-by-month basis, including my vehicle and my apartment. If I had money stashed, the police or Income Tax people would have found it. I was watched extensively. I presumed my cell phone was always monitored. When, in late July, the DEA undercover agent posing as seed buyer tried to get me to sell her ten pounds of pot over the phone, I refused and told her that I always assumed my cell phone was monitored, so how could she be so foolish and naive? When she asked again at a later time, I lectured her at length. Not only did I not sell pot, she was being very reckless to even think about importing pot to the USA.</p>
<p>The DEA even has a subscription to Cannabis Culture, with their money orders on US Department of Justice cheques. I figured if the US government got that pissed off, they'd just ask the Vancouver Police to raid me, like in the 1996 to 1998 period. </p>
<p>I was always raided after appearing in A-list American media. A month after the Wall Street Journal: raided. A month after Rolling Stone: raided. Two months after the CNN Visits Canada's Prince of Pot special in October 1997: raided. The police took a million dollars in store and business assets in total, but I was not even charged on either occasion, and received small fines from the courts when I was charged on two others. The last fine I got for selling seeds in 1998 was $700 per count; seven counts, $5,000 in total. From a $700 fine for seeds in 1998, to life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty in 2005... that's an outrageous contrast.</p>
<p><b><u>Personal and Political Progress</u></b></p>
<p>A lot of good was accomplished through all that struggle, trial and tribulation. In 1994, there were no hemp stores, no activist activity, no medical marijuana program, no pot retail industry, not even legally obtained books and magazines about marijuana in Canada. Eleven years later, there are over 75 hemp activist stores; literature and magazines were made legal; medical marijuana is legal; the hemp industry is in a great revival. Marijuana legalization and the drug war have been discussed daily in the Canadian media for the past ten years. Regulations continue to improve for Canada's medical cannabis program. </p>
<p>Phillip Owen, a former Mayor of Vancouver (1993 to 2001) was at one time a very vocal prohibitionist in office. He denounced me in the New York Times. But by the end of his third term, he became a brilliant and articulate anti-prohibitionist after hearing me speak throughout local elections and in the media.</p>
<p>In December 2002, the White House Drug Czar came to Vancouver for a highly publicized speech at the Vancouver Board of Trade to set the Mayor and other "legalizers" straight. Before his speech began, I went up and asked the Drug Czar if I could have a photograph of us together; when he asked "and who are you?" a photo was snapped as I said, "My name is Marc Emery, I'm the publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine." He turned beet-red and was hustled away by his agents. As he spoke on stage afterwards, we heckled him when he rattled off his catalog of lies about marijuana. There were five tables of police at that speech, two tables of US Consulate people, over 50 Secret Service agents protecting Walters. Oh, he remembers me all right!</p>
<p><span class="inline inline-left"><img alt="Drug Czar John Walters meets Marc Emery" width="288" height="191" src="/library/images/uploads/4639-4588-JohnWalters_Emery.jpg"><span class="caption" style="width: 288px;"><strong>Drug Czar John Walters meets Marc Emery</strong></span></span>The next day, former Mayor Phillip Owen, Mayor-elect Larry Campbell and city councilors met with Walters. Owen later told the Vancouver Courier paper "It was the most intense meeting of my life. There is no one more uninformed about drugs than the Drug Czar." Members of City Council recently told me Walters and his lieutenants threatened, screamed at and insulted the elected Vancouver officials, and guaranteed that if Vancouver pursued legal marijuana policies, the border would be shut down to Canadian commerce heading for America.</p>
<p>Current Mayor (and appointed Senator to Canada's Parliament) Larry Campbell was my rival for Mayor in the Vancouver 2002 election. I got to speak about legalization on over 15 occasions in his presence. He was elected. He spoke at the Beyond Prohibition 2004 Conference in which a grant of $18,000 from Marc Emery Direct Seeds went to the BC Civil Liberties Association to hold the event. That conference is where Mr. Campbell famously and momentously announced that marijuana should legalized, taxed and regulated, and that prohibition should end.</p>
<p>I participated in elections in 1996 (Mayor of Vancouver); 2000 (Canadian Marijuana Party, federal election); 2001 (BC Marijuana Party, provincial election); 2002 (Mayor of Vancouver); 2005 (BC Marijuana Party, provincial election). During the 2005 BC provincial election, Vancouver City Councilman Tim Stevenson invited me to a fundraiser. He introduced me proudly to his supporters at the fundraiser and said "Marc is here to lend his support because he knows I believe in legalization". I did not run against him in that riding because Tim is a good man; but again, do you think if there was any taint anywhere in my life that these people would introduce me to crowds of key supporters?</p>
<p>Adriane Carr is leader of the BC Green Party. In 2002, the BC Greens launched a petition drive to get proportional representation on the ballot as a people's initiative. The BC Greens didn't have the money, but I believed in the cause so I personally gave Adrianne Carr $7,000 to finance the petition drive. That was money from my only source of income - marijuana seed sales!</p>
<p>I never met a person, government agency, politician, tax department, or any charitable or non-governmental agency who refused any money from me, even though I was world famous as a marijuana seed seller. Banks opened accounts and issued credit cards, and I was honest and candid with every last one of them.</p>
<p>Over 10 years, I gave just under $4,000,000 (four million dollars) to North American and international activist organizations, activist politicians, ballot initiatives throughout the United States, referendums, court challenges, Supreme Court of Canada challenges, refugees, bail costs, legal defense funds, political parties, individuals, drug addiction clinics, media, medical bills for activists (Terence McKenna, Jack Herer), Compassion Clubs (legal bills and start-up money), Hemp fests, conferences, Global Marijuana Marches (2000 to 2005), full page anti-prohibition ads in Canadian newspapers, HEMP BC Legal Assistance Centre... and the list goes on. It's an extraordinary record of unparalleled distribution of the proceeds from our beloved plant. </p>
<p>A month after Walters' visit, the Vancouver Police Department - who behaved so chummily with Walters on the evening of, and days following his speech - launched an investigation of my seed business with the intent of laying charges. Over 6 months, the VPD scoped out my mail order business, monitored my seed office, bought some seeds undercover, and in the summer of 2003 - during my very successful Summer of Legalization Tour - went to the Crown Attorney to lay charges. But at that time, marijuana was legal to possess in Canada and it was doubtful if seeds were actually illegal. The Crown Attorney refused to proceed with charges. </p>
<p>This had the impact of infuriating the Vancouver Police and John Walters. With the tacit approval of BC Solicitor-General Richard Coleman, the Vancouver Police investigation file was handed over to the DEA in October 2003. The DEA continued the investigation, committing substantial resources and finances to it. The DEA proceeded to order seeds by mail, and comb the records of American growers who were busted with evidence of seed purchases from me.</p>
<p>On April 27, 2004, while I was on a 22-city tour of Canada to promote support for NDP leader Jack Layton, arsonists tried to destroy the BCMP Headquarters and severely damaged it (the Blunt Brothers building next door was entirely destroyed). The Vancouver Police "investigation" revealed nothing, and it has long been thought to be the act of DEA or Vancouver police agents. </p>
<p>After the VPD had failed in their efforts to charge me locally and extinguish our headquarters, I was punished by being jailed for 62 days in Saskatoon Correction Centre on August 19th, 2004 for the crime of passing one joint in Saskatoon earlier that year. I did the same job that Martha Stewart did in her prison: I was the toilet cleaner and janitor for the senior administrative staff of the jail. In October 2004, while still in jail, the DEA started coming to my store to buy from the seed desk. They were assisted by the Vancouver Police Department and BC Solicitor-General Coleman in every way.</p>
<p><span class="inline inline-left"><img alt="Get Out of Our Country" width="320" height="208" src="/library/images/uploads/4639-DEAFlag.jpg"><span class="caption" style="width: 320px;"><strong>Get Out of Our Country</strong></span></span>On May 6, 2005, while I was campaigning in an election against Solicitor-General Coleman, a grand jury in Seattle, Washington indicted me for seed selling, conspiring to help Americans produce marijuana, and distributing my money (money laundering).</p>
<p>Under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty - which the US pressures every country to sign - the Attorney-General of Canada of Canada, then Irwin Cotler, agreed to allow my arrest for Extradition to the United States to face trial for my activities in Canada. Irwin Cotler, the former Canadian Justice Minister and Attorney General in the previous Liberal government, was himself a famous human rights activist. </p>
<p>No one in Canada has ever been sentenced to jail for selling seeds. Only two people have ever been fined: myself in 1996 and 1998; and Ian Hunter, fined $200 in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Now Canada has a Conservative Party government that believes all marijuana people who grow and sell and pass joints should go to jail! The Canadian Minister of Justice and Attorney-General, Conservative Robert Nicholson, may be the one who holds my fate in the balance. If the BC Supreme Court commits me for extradition after the Extradition Hearing, a five day affair beginning May 28, 2007, then Attorney-General Nicholson holds my fate in his hands.</p>
<p>Depending on how many people write, email or call the politicians of Canada, Robert Nicholson will decide if the government of Canada agrees to the Extradition. The maximum term of incarceration for murder in Canada is 25 years, yet under US federal sentencing guidelines, I would receive minimum 17 to 21 years for being, to quote DEA boss Karen Tandy of the on the day of my arrest, "designated as one of [the US] Attorney-General's most-wanted international drug trafficking organizational targets - one of only 46 in the world and the only one in Canada." I'd get an additional mandatory minimum of 10 years on the money laundering charge. </p>
<p>The head of the DEA fumes with contempt in her media release, reiterating four times that her principle concern is with legalization activities. She uses phrases like "publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine, and the founder of a marijuana legalization group", "is a significant blow ... to ... the marijuana legalization movement", "hundreds of thousands of dollars ... are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canada", "drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on".</p>
<p>Additionally, the DEA head referred to me as the only target of the DEA in Canada, virtually making me the biggest "kingpin" in all of Canada! She even called Cannabis Culture a "propagandist" magazine!</p>
<p>On CNN's Lou Dobbs program on March 30, 2005, the DEA claimed I was responsible for the manufacture of 100,000 pounds of marijuana for every year I was in the seed business. Eleven years of revolutionary seed retail activism means the DEA is claiming I am responsible for 1,100,000 pounds of marijuana, with a conservative wholesale value of $3,000,000,000 (three billion dollars). If you figure that aspiring hip hop performer Weldon Angelos got 55 years for one ounce of pot, what do think the sentence is going to be for a man the DEA and US Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales claims is the largest marijuana producer of all time ever prosecuted in the US criminal justice system? </p>
<p>I tell Canadians that to let me be extradited to the United States means Canada will never see me alive again. To the DEA, I am the leader of the movement that seeks to thwart, defy, undermine them and end their reign of terror over the cannabis culture. They are never going to let me walk and talk and campaign against them once I am in their clutches.  </p>
<p><span class="inline inline-right"><img alt="The DEA versus... little plant seeds?" width="300" height="197" src="/library/images/uploads/4639-seeds.jpg"><span class="caption" style="width: 300px;"><strong>The DEA versus... little plant seeds?</strong></span></span><b><u>For What It's Worth</u></b></p>
<p>Overgrow the Government. Inherent in that beautiful phrase are so many ideals and glories of a co-operative, peaceful society. Plant the seeds of freedom. Not overthrow, which speaks of violent conflict, but overgrow, using God's greatest plant and the enlightenment that comes from ingesting marijuana to further a peaceful, democratic, revolution based on tolerance and love and unity of all peoples. Plants, not violence. Reason, not murderous incarceration. Personal freedom, not Nazi-like paramilitary violence.</p>
<p>I am being punished for my success. I have achieved much in my eleven years in British Columbia. Clearly, the very dark and powerful forces emanating from the White House believe they have the upper hand, that they have stopped our revolution. This is the time when the Bush-Walters White House is making the most aggressive attack on our culture ever, and not just on me. </p>
<p>In March 2004, my wonderful friend Mike Smith received a 30-year sentence in an Oklahoma federal prison for growing 200 plants. He had already served six years on a previous cultivation offence. His wife, Yvonne Toy, received a 15-year sentence, her first offence ever, for those same 200 plants.</p>
<p>The Bush White House, the DEA, and US police forces are arresting more Americans for marijuana than ever before, pursuing marijuana people with a frenzy never before seen in history. On October 17, 2005, the FBI revealed 771,608 persons were arrested for marijuana violations in 2004. The total is the highest ever and comprised 44.2 percent of all drug arrests in the United States. Since 1965, 17 million Americans have been arrested for marijuana offences, and arrests have skyrocketed in the past 12 years.</p>

<p>Immediately upon my arrest in Halifax on July 29th, reaction was swift and loud throughout Canada. The Vancouver Sun had a screaming headline "UNCLE SAM ORCHESTRATES VANCOUVER POT BUSTS".  It was all over every Canadian media. I was kept in 4 different jails over 7 days, and saw none of the coverage until I was released on bail on August 5. </p>
<p>As I was being arrested, the largest issue ever of Cannabis Culture Magazine was rolling off the presses. By the time I was released, the magazine with the 12-page Marc Emery Seed catalog was printed, but could not be distributed until the readers were warned not to order seeds from my now-shut down seed business. A sticker was printed and individually attached to all 75,000 copies, and that took over 30 days to complete, delaying the release of the last issue by a full month.</p>
<p>I was now in the most difficult bind in my life. My only source of income was terminated, and I had to make Cannabis Culture Magazine, POT.TV and the BCMP Bookstore self-sufficient immediately. I had to find tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees (obtaining bail the first week took $18,000 in legal fees, an additional $20,000 cash bail for a cash requirement of $38,000 before I even got out of jail). I was without any income and had massive problems to deal with. I immediately had to lay off employees, move out of my apartment, return my rented car, and move in with my assistant editor (and now wife) Jodie. I had to survive on as little as possible; my only income was modest charity from supporters and activists. </p>
<p>With 21 arrests, 17 jailings, and now six raids for marijuana related activity under my belt, I feel experienced enough to tackle my greatest challenge ever. Facing brutal finances, huge legal bills, and life imprisonment without parole for something no one in Canada has ever even gone to jail for, I still have to provide focused, calm and convincing leadership. </p>
<p>I've done a record number of interviews with North American and world media since then. The CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes (twice) aired a segment to its twelve million viewers about my struggle to legalize marijuana. I am reaching new audiences: older people, Canadian nationalists, and - to my joy - people who don't smoke pot, and do not ordinarily identify with the cannabis culture. The staggering punishment to be meted out to me is common in the United States for marijuana offences, and many people in Canada are realizing this for the first time. </p>
<p>From September 10 to September 24 in 2005, there were demonstrations on my behalf at Canadian and US embassies and consulates in 43 cities around the world. <a href="http://mapinc.org">Mapinc.org</a> has archives of over 300 letters printed in newspapers condemning my extradition, and over 400 newspapers and publications have written about my work and the extradition request. </p>
<p>I tell people now that this extradition attempt is a blessing, because it has galvanized the world movement for cannabis peace. It has given me an even stronger personal urge to have marijuana legalized in Canada within two years, and I am given opportunity in regular media exposure to be a proud spokesperson for our great culture. I am not afraid of the task ahead of me. I am not afraid of jail for the rest of my life, undoubtably painful as that would be. I don't fear prison rape or abuse or suffering or lonliness, though those miseries will no doubt be present in a US federal prison. My fear is that the marijuana people will continue to be taken away to lives of ruin and despair by a murderous police state. My fear is that Canada will be absorbed as a compliant puppet state of the US War on Drugs. My fear is that the DEA, with offices in 65 nations around the Earth, will have more and more citizens from other countries extradited to the USA to face draconian punishments for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><span class="inline inline-right"><img alt="Marc and Michelle outside the BCMP Bookstore" width="300" height="226" src="/library/images/uploads/4639-BCMP.jpg"><span class="caption" style="width: 300px;"><strong>Marc and Michelle outside the BCMP Bookstore</strong></span></span>I fear for Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams, facing extradition for simply being in my activist organization. Greg, aka Marijuana Man of Pot.tv, is a fine and wonderful friend who brings knowledge, joy and pleasure to everyone he meets. He is being punished for being a supporter of me and the movement. Michelle is the most selfless activist I have ever known. A fantastic woman, she suffers daily with Crohns Disease, and needs marijuana to control her very damaged and disabled organs, yet has helped hundreds - if not thousands - of people with her unrelenting effort to make marijuana legal. </p>
<p>Michelle has been my great ally in this struggle, and she surely should be nominated for sainthood. She is so worthy of your support. She MUST NOT be extradited to a US jail. She will die in horrible pain there. My American friends, my Canadian friends, this cannot be permitted to happen. A terrible injustice will have occurred if Michelle Rainey exists in pain and torture in an American jail. There will be terrible karma in the world if one of God's most beautiful souls is allowed to be destroyed by apathy and cowardice in her most critical time of need. The people can save her from extradition, if they speak out to the Canadian Minister of Justice. Speak to power, my friends; her life depends on it. </p>
<p>The months ahead will be filled with unprecedented personal challenges for me. I will try to speak on behalf of our culture with passion, reason and good values. I will be interviewed extensively, and I hope I am a spokesman and activist and leader you can be proud of.</p>
<p>I certainly could use your help. I need an army of activists writing letters, petitioning, wearing NO EXTRADITION T-shirts, demonstrating in front of Canadian consulates and embassies, voting in elections, joining a political party in Canada or the United States to make your views on prohibition heard. I certainly need any money you can give. If you believe my record of service to our culture merits your support, then I tell you: <b>we need your support.</b></p>
<p>Marijuana is a 7 to 15 billion-dollar a year industry in Canada, where hundreds of thousands - perhaps half a million - people are growing and selling marijuana. Millions and millions of Canadians and Americans consume this marijuana. Canadian growers, dealers, and seed sellers deal with Americans every day. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of my arrest for activity I did here in Canada, it is apparent any activist or handler of seeds, medical marijuana, or commercial marijuana could be extraditable. If you have any connection to any marijuana transaction that traces to the USA, you are liable to be considered party to a conspiracy to import marijuana into the United States. That's certainly bringing the US drug war into Canada in an incredible and dangerous way. Everyone in Canada's cannabis culture is now at much greater risk because of this precedent.</p>
<p>Yet Canadians don't want this barbaric drug war. After 10 years of our activism, Canadians now overwhelmingly reject fines, jail time or any punishment as an option for marijuana possession, according to a NORML Canada November 2004 nation-wide poll. A majority of Canadians favor a taxed and regulated system of marijuana distribution.</p>
<p>While Canada pursues an independent approach to cannabis laws and prohibition, away from the US drug war model, there is hope for both Canadians and Americans of the cannabis culture. If Canada becomes free from prohibition, then American prohibition will fall. But if the United States government is allowed to triumph with intimidation, blackmail, and increased arrests in Canada, stifling our progress, and sending Canada backwards, then liberation for all North America is that much more elusive.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>I'm sitting here in total awe after reading Marc's recent post.<br />
From our family to yours Marc and Jodie our best wishes are with you and the BC3, we are doing what we can on our end for you. You have the hearts of many, It is like I stated in a recent e-mail with HT, We all fight for the same cause. So we must all stand for the same cause. Now is the time where we must come togeather, we must all stand and for those of us who cannot Marc, Greg and Michelle are standing for you.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't yet signed the petition, please do, take the time and do what you can. It will go far. Sink them in them in the paperwork. For those of you who have signed and do what you can, I will assure you that these great people really do appreciate each and every thing that you do to help.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know, I am a Canadian Pot Farmer somewhere in Nova Scotia, that is in total discust at the Canadian Government right now for even considering what they are against the BC3. Let alone that Nova Scotia had such an ugly part to play in all this, Who gives N.S. the right to arrest him...That really blows the whistle.</p>
<p>What blew me away was the many different charges they were attempting to lay on Marc, mind you meanwhile Marc's been declairing the is makings of his business to the Canadian Government...Money Laundering...That's the one that really blew my whistle. How dare they, they sit on their a$$e$ make money faster than I can even harvest...They all make money off Marc and Jodie's buisness, alot of money and they wanna play a greedy game like its not good enough for them anymore all of a sudden, they never minded spending it for years.... </p>
<p>Best wishes to you in these tough times.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>well what they are doing to these three ppl is very very wrong, my boyfriend and i just oreder seeds from the netherlands...and we had no problem getting them, there is no law that states owning seedds and seeling them is illegal(in CANADA THAT I KNOW OF), i dont understand how they can ever arrest sumone when its CLEARLY NOT ILLEGAL!!! this whole incident dicusts me very much so, i hope for the three of you nothing happens and that you can stay in canada, and not go to jail in the states, when i ordered my seeds the website even said that there law in counrties that prohibit owing seeds and that they dont keep up with all the laws and its not their reponsiblity to do so, if you live in a country that isnt allowed to posess seeds dont do so, its that easy,<br />
THE AMERICAN GOV. IS STUPID, AND NEEDS TO CHANGE, THEY ARE ALL SCREW UPS, EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT HAS EVER RUN THAT COUNRTY IS DUMBER THAN DUMB I COULD PROLLY RUN THAT PLACE BETTER MY SELF AND THATS SAD, ITS SAD THAT CANADIAN EVEN HAVE TO FACE THIS ISSUE, WHAT DOES THE STATES HAVE ANY BUSINESS ARRESTING 3 PPL WHO ARE JUST MAKING A LIVING, IF POSSESING SEEDS IS ILLEGAL IN THE STATES MAYBE THEY SHOULD REFRESH THE PUBLICS MEMORY, AND IF THEY DONT WANT SEEDS ENTERING THEIR COUNRTY, THEY SHOULD CHECK THEIR MAIL BETTER, WHAT MARCK AND THIS BUSINESS PARTNERS ARE DOING IS NOT ILLEGAL AT ALL...AND THEY DEFFINATLEY SHOULD NOT BE EXTRIDITED TO AMERICA WHERE THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING WORNG, NEVER GREW WEED OR SOLD ANY.....SO WHATS THE BIG DEAL?? STUPID AMERICANS....GOD I HATE THEMM....BE STONG MARK AND COLLEGUES, EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT WELL....YOULL BE HOME IN NO TIME......</p>

        <div class="content"><p>What I want to know is...where can you go? All governments are basically corrupt. If you want change, you have to shout it from the rooftops and do everything in your power to advertise for change. Marc Emery is a great example of activism at its finest. America can be saved...it has a lot of honorable people who love freedom. The USA had a revolution before, it can and will do so again. My country Canada wants to bring in Mandatory minimums and build a dozen new prisons...to house herb people. The world is fast becoming a prison planet. These are dark times. People have to remember... we are the government, not the corporations and their lobbyists.</p>

                <h3 class="title"><a href="/v2/articles/4639.html#comment-6177" class="active">Thank you Marc and God bless you.</a></h3>
        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>Along time ago we had no rights that today people take so easily for granted, to find a Bong was a treasure because the Law made these simple items contraband and you only had rolling papers and your own creativity. It was people like Marc Emery who is the frontier of these times that people so easily take for granted simply do not think of and the fact that it is possible to go backwards once more and lose what precious freedoms we’ve gained this far.</p>
<p>  People like Marc Emery come only once in a rare lifetime to be able to see the world and effectively make changes in areas that help causes and has shown to be an amazing motivator, while sharing us knowledge, enough for us all who sat in our closets in fear of our Government while he taught, “You are not alone, Knowledge is their to defend with real truths”.  So people like me and others who want to reach out and help that one person in the crowd to save someone but can’t, won’t or just don’t know how to help that person or even themselves. Marc is that one person, no matter what the criticisms out their may be, The screaming voice coming from the crowd yelling for help that everyone ignores and walks by, Marc reached out and so many others became strengthened and appeared from the crowd ready to help, when just before they stood in apprehension saying to themselves “What can I do?”</p>
<p>  It takes that one Leader from the crowd and soon you have the movement but if that one person never steps forward then it becomes the same repetitive sad story of, what can I do and nothing gets done. Marc said I know what to do and now he’s taking the bullet for being on that front line for us and it seems to me to be pretty honorable when the funds that he received went back to our cause and has nothing to his name to show for it but our memories and how we remember him. Sure Marc might have had multiple personal reasons which gave him his push but no one can say they have reached in this country as far as Marc has for changing the many Ignorant peoples minds from old misinformation of lies to the now we know inalienable rights and truths. This Man gave it all away and is possibly about to lose many years and we will look back and see what he sacrificed just to make it so we the people don’t have to hide like we are ashamed and instead yell I am a better person because of Cannabis. I am thankful to Marc Emery who showed me I am not alone and I should not be ashamed but be proud to choose a safer healthier lifestyle from the ones that Society forces upon us by limiting us.</p>
<p>  So when Marc does come back, hopefully; someone will stand at the front line trying to make changes on our behalf until that day and see it might take bigger shoes then they ever thought possible. </p>
<p>  Sorry to put you way up high on that pedestal Marc but someone has to be up their or there would be no Gandhi or Luther Martin King and you have that job for our cause in this country to help take away the draconian Laws that hold us down and I hope we remember this when he comes back and we may find that after time we have already lost Marc this day forever because prison does change you on the inside and could damage our Leader.</p>
<p>  Thanks again Marc for what you are giving up; I hope you know you did reach many and you did take away the frustrations and fears by giving us truer knowledge, a lot of us are no longer alone in our lives thinking maybe society is right and we are bad people. We all now stand a little taller because you gave us weapons of Mass Knowledge and now we can be armed with more truth than the deception imposed on us by our Governments.<br />
Thank you and God bless you, MARC EMERY.</p>
<p>Please give till it hurts if you can and try and make Marcs stay a little less like hell.</p>

<p>BTW, did you notice the new tactic being used here by people to sell stuff? Instead of saying buy this they say something that seems like a normal poster but then they put a link to a selling site instead of putting their name at the end of the post. Sneaky buggers just won't stop the scamming. Other people are actually replying to the scammers' posts as if they were real posts.</p>

If you want legal drugs, buy an island and move there where the normal, sane, and non-psychotic people can live in peace without you all. I hope the DEA just starts shooting users to get them off the streets and out of people's lives. Good luck and please choke on your next roach so the rest of us can live in peace.</p>

        <div class="content"><p>you make weed smokers seem like they are in the same playing field as heroin junkies, but they are not, heroin is a much worse drug. the thing that annoys me is that anti-legalization supporters do not know what it is like to smoke pot, therefore the only knowledge they have of it is what they get from propaganda. i smoke weed a lot and i have lost no mental capacity, i am not addicted to it in any way, and it has not become a gateway drug for harder drugs. i know a man that can support a family and has a military/government job and he smokes weed EVERY DAY and has done so for 40 years. so until you have smoked marijuana you cannot judge us based on what you think you know. bitch.</p>

I wish people like you would just shut up and learn some facts and become informed before just blasting your ignorant garbage, you only make yourself look like an complete idiot and coming on here and spouting your hatred for something you are totally ignorant about it just goes to show how intelligent you really are.<br />
go ahead and keep on believing the lies that the government and the news and media and your conservative party tells you, and one day you when you are ill and you have nowhere to turn these people that you persecute will be there to help you. your pathetic excuse for a human being wont even realize how lucky you are. and by then and only then maybe your undeserving ass may become humbled and grateful. but i hope that never happens. because even for me i would never wish the illnesses Ive seen cured and mellowed by cannabis on you, you can have your opinions but don't spread hate in the name of ignorance because that's what kind of garbage you are spouting here.<br />

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>Hi there Marc, I just wished to let you know I support you through thick and thin about all your opinions on Cannabis, The time is near. As most of us know Marijuana should not be illegal, It's benefits outweigh it's downsides, The legalization and control of Cannabis by most governments is inevitable within most of our lifetimes, Slowly but surely, all activists are getting their point across. Whether it be a small town hall meeting, or posting on a forum telling people the truth about this amazing plant. You change thousands of peoples minds on their opinions on Cannabis, We can not thank you enough for what you have done in the past and what you shall do for us in the future. The DEA's plan to extradite you is absurd, If justice does not prevail and show that you are not guilty of any crimes besides helping people through tough times, If that's a crime, then shoot me down. The DEA's influence on modern day, making people aware of what drugs are of harm to our society and wrongfully accusing recreational or even medical cannabis users to such an extent that it scares many others, They waste hundreds of millions of dollars imprisoning people that are harmless and have done no wrong. For something that originally growed naturally on this planet, it is treated so severely people are having their lives thrown away by some agency that thinks it's immoral to feel nice and cheery to all those around you. As for your extradition, I will work as hard as possible to do my part in preventing it. </p>
<p>Thank you Mr. Emery, you will always be a continuous inspiration to all of us, this century is truly one for the record books.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Lorne.</p>
<p>{HELP STOP THE EXTRADITION OF MARC EMERY SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT www.cannabisculture.com}</p>
<p>NEVER GIVE UP HOPE!</p>

        <div class="content"><p>Perhaps it is time to take this war on drugs back to the rat bastards in the American government who think they have a right to trample on others rights.</p>
<p>As anyone who knows politics can tell you terrorism is a valid working form of political expression in the world today. Anyone who doubts this need only look at the PLO and the way they are treated today on the political stage.</p>
<p>It may be time for the "Bill and Ted" attitudes of the past to be cast down for one of" an eye for an eye." Why not drive the cost of this war up another 1000% with each year it is extended. </p>
<p>Here is just one thing to get the ball rolling.<br />
Publishing all Narcs pictures. along with home address and family names might make them stop and reflect on what they feel is important</p>
<p>A destroyed squad car for a bust seems a fair trade.<br />
These bully assholes are used to hunting not being hunted. I am getting too old to turn the other cheek.</p>

Not the way my friends and family were raised. The culture in our government is SO OUT OF TOUCH with the culture of our people. I don't know how to change that. I wish I did. I don't blame people for hating the USA. It makes no sense that we would go after citizens of another country. I think Canada should tell the DEA to stuff it. By the way, what's with the Canadian Attorney General not telling the USA to piss off? I question both governments. Neither seems to have the good sense that God gave a duck. I'm sorry Mr. Emery, Ms. Rainey and Mr. Williams. Unfortunately you now know what it's like to be an American. It a lot of ways, it sucks.</p>

        <div class="content"><p>I could not agree more with the previously stated outrage presented by other American Citizens on this board. I can not believe that we would go after the citizens of another country...well I mean again (Iraq) but I digress. I will do everything in my power to help the Legalization movement. I myself have had a resent encounter with the US governments failed prohibition laws. I was in my own home causing no disturbance when a knock at my door alerted me to the police presence. Stating they had been called out on a domestic disturbance 9Of witch there was none.) The forceable entered my home despite my adoration against. They confiscated less than an eighth of marijuana. So far I have spent over a thousand dollars defending myself and the best out come still put me on probation for 6 months, 40 hours community service, and I have to take a drug awareness class (at my own expense might I add!) I am not trying to compare my story with Marc's however I feel his pain and I have become more soildified in my goal of ending the marijuana prohibition not only through my own encounters (witch sucked) but by seeing how much worse it could have been through Marc's story. FREE MARC EMERY!!!</p>

We are accepting signatures from all over the world though Many Canadians have signed it already</p>
<p>The petition is called: "Legalize marijuana and end the senseless "War on Drugs'". </p>
<p>Please take a moment to read about this important issue, and join me in signing the petition. It takes just 30 seconds, but can truly make a difference. We are trying to reach 1000 signatures - please sign here:</p>

        <div class="content"><p>For those who've not yet watched the CBS video "The Lens Price of Pot," available on multiple bit torrents, or the National Geographic video "Marijuana Nation" I urge you to view them. Marc Emery I do not know personally. I will not cease in defending his rights as a human being who has done nothing but sold SEEDS of PLANTS that GOD created and gave to humanity.

I know their children will surely miss them and I’ll never toke again without some real guilt!! The pot issue aside, we cannot allow Canadians to be deported to end up dying in US jails!! For smoking pot?? Especially after Obama’s own brother just got busted for pot in Africa last week!</p>
<p>Please call the number (613) 957-4222 as suggested in the article and voice your opinions. I have!! This is wrong and you now have a way to help our greatest dealer and really stand up for being a FREE Canadian as never before!!</p>

She told two friends, they told two friends and they told two friends, sooner, rather than later, we all told the U.S. what they can do with Extradition and Ancient drug laws. Isn't Cannabis an herb?

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>I speak from first hand knowledge of the rules that can be severe in the majority of states with respect to punishments that are harsh. The reasons for this vary from the use of the 'arrest' to humiliate the violator and use harsh penalties as an example of the 'down home' legal system. Many people in America do smoke for MMJ purposes that exceed recreational users. Unfortunatly the younger smokers are the problem. Not that serious and mature persons can't responsibly mandate the use and distrubution of MMJ, more the younger smokers seem to use it recreationally causing the 'close minded' effect around them. This is a short line among most states. "We" (Americans) are striving to more education through word of mouth. One day I hope we can reach an open-ness much as you have achieved so far in your life. I do not see an entire government bow down to a command based on laws of that country alone. If you have commited a crime in your own country, that is a matter that should be dealt with in your country. Americans in general try to convert others if they feel they are acting unlike the role model that America is trying to place upon the entire world. I do love America but I do respect the citizens of all other countries. I count on my country to take care of me no matter where I should be, as should yours. Many blessings to you and I am positive that an entire country such as your own would never bow down to the idle demands of justice for crimes not commited in America. Trust your brothers.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>Mr. Emery,<br />
I sincerely appreciate all of the work that you and many others have painstakingly accomplished towards the ultimate goal of legalization. It is only through sheer determination and immense hardship that change becomes evident. It is horrible and outright wrong that the United States has such a stranglehold on OUR political system, and I am ashamed to say that I live within a country that is so willing to fold under the slightest amount of political pressure. As the United States continues policing the entire world, I am sure that many others with a voice for reason will be singled out and be facing similar circumstance. It is obvious that you have become a great threat to the "war on freedom" and that the charges you face are strictly political. I personally pledge to not only buy a t-shirt but to sign the petition, contact the justice minister and forward a letter to all members of parliament, voicing my disgust for the situation afflicting the BC3. I cannot imagine what you and your family must be going through.<br />
You definitely hit a nerve and they know you represent a threat to our grandfather's anti-freedom policies.</p>
<p>My thoughts are with you throughout the struggle,<br />
Dan</p>

        <div class="content"><p>DEA of Washinton, should check out this bill/measure that went into effect in the state Washinton (attacted State Laws copy)..........</p>
<p> Home &gt;  Washington (medical)</p>
<p>Washington </p>
<p>Share This Page      </p>
<p>SUMMARY: Fifty-nine percent of voters approved Measure 692 on November 3, 1998. The law took effect on that day. It removes state-level criminal penalties on the use, possession and cultivation of marijuana by patients who possess "valid documentation" from their physician affirming that he or she suffers from a debilitating condition and that the "potential benefits of the medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the health risks." Patients diagnosed with the following illnesses are afforded legal protection under this act: cachexia; cancer; HIV or AIDS; epilepsy; glaucoma; intractable pain (defined as pain unrelieved by standard treatment or medications); and multiple sclerosis. Other conditions are subject to approval by the Washington Board of Health. Patients (or their primary caregivers) may legally possess or cultivate no more than a 60-day supply of marijuana. The law does not establish a state-run patient registry.</p>
<p>AMENDMENTS: Yes. </p>
<p>Senate Bill 6032, mandated the Department of Health to "adopt rules defining the quantity of marijuana that could reasonably be presumed to be a sixty-day supply for qualifying patients." In October 2008, the department finalized guidelines allowing patients to cultivate up to 15 cannabis plants and/or possess up to 24 ounces of usable marijuana. The new limits took effect on November 2, 2008.</p>
<p>Patients who possess larger quantities of cannabis than those approved by the Department will continue to receive legal protection under the law if they present evidence indicating that they require such amounts to adequately treat their qualifying medical condition.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 6032 also affirmed changes previously recommended by the state's Medical Quality Assurance Commission to expand the state's list of qualifying conditions to include Crohn's disease, hepatitis c, and any "diseases, including anorexia, which results in nausea, vomiting, wasting, appetite loss, cramping, seizures, muscle spasms, and/or spasticity, when these symptoms are unrelieved by standard treatments or medications."</p>
<p>It also limits the ability of police to seize medicinal cannabis that is "determined ... [to be] possessed lawfully [by an authorized patients] under the ... law."</p>

What a Government? What people do in CANADA should stay in CANADA! Just like Vegas!I wish i was somebody powerful so i could have a say in this situation.Whatever BC3,s do i back them! the us should worry about itself i mean come on Micheal Phelps the united states represenative swimmer inth us olympics is a pot head and the us didnt even know??? how lame the usa is!!!!!!!! Wish i were born in CANADA or somewhere else were plants and seeds are legal. Basically 99.3 percent of us smokes marijuana or if not that some other type of drug ive seen what alchol can do and thats legal. i could talk all day about this type of stuff. peace best of luck BC3 wish i could be in sams growhouse.

<p>I cannot tell you how sad, and outraged your situation makes me. You have done so  much for our rights to grow, and smoke marijuana. Im writing to thank you for your courage. I wish  I were a rich man so I could donate money to your cause. Yet,  I can promise to raise awareness with everyone I know about your case;  persuade them to write, petition, and complain about this terrible injustice, and misuse of power by the DEA. </p>
<p>Mr. Emery please keep your head up.... you are not alone. Eventually WE WILL win.</p>

plz look at them .<br />
cos i and others dont think they have the power or the right to make you go to court<br />
at all and as for the so called aint weed LAW its not a real law with any real power .<br />
its an Act and as such has no power as long as you dont give it power over you .<br />
 look up Human law and or comman and crim .<br />
 an Act of LAW is to be so limeted in its operation that NO right shall be prejudiced.<br />
Actus legis nemini injurm -an Act of law dose no man injury to NO man.<br />
 a natural person is a Human being-an Artificial person-a legal Entity (not Human<br />
thats how they get you they say to you are you mr.smith and you say yes your doomed<br />
the courts dont have the power to make you go to court untill "you" give it tom them<br />
plz look at the vids i have sent</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>The BC3 and Mark are one of the best things that have happened to civil liberties in a long time! I am an unproud American and only wish I was a Canadian!! There are significant differences between the social aspects of life between the two countries, namely the levels of violence and ability to think. While government is more or less the same everywhere, the U.S establishment is by far one of the largest tyranical entities known to all (they take the bloody cake). I have great respect for the courage and brutal honesty of the BC3 (and all advocates) for hemp and cannabis. It is unfortunate that the old mind has no place for the new mind and is remeniscent of vampiric activity (Peter Tosh said this) that sucks individual liberties and lives with substituted manufactured substances (i.e pharma, meth, heroin, booze, cigarettes, etc..), rather than a natural substance that has been with us for over 5,000 years. Marijuana will be around forever, wether certain stiff-necked "law makers" like it or not!!</p>

                <h3 class="title"><a href="/v2/articles/4639.html#comment-3044" class="active">the cusp of historically significant cultural change</a></h3>
        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>Ottawa should recognize that they are at the tipping point of a significant historical moment.  On the one hand they have a heroic figure who selflessly struggled against censorship, oppression, and what is nothing short of class warfare against people who seek solace in marijuana.  On the other hand, Ottawa faces intense pressure from a hegemonic neighbor, unconcerned with the sovereignty of its hemisphere trading partners.  The question will come down to whether Ottawa honors sovereignty and a homegrown civil rights leader, or is ruled primarily by fear of consequences and lack of backbone in dealing with an intolerant and pushy neighbor.</p>
<p>If Ottawa buckles under U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration pressure, history will lurch dramatically toward a unified North American fascism dictated in Washington.  If Ottawa strikes an independent chord, history stays open to further debate and a bit more diversity.</p>
<p>Marc Emery is already a historically significant figure, if nothing else for his efforts against censorship in a modern society.  Consider the possibilities of giving this man another decade or two to inform and educate.  We could be looking back at Canadian history that includes a figure as internationally significant as Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, Ghandi, and Susan B. Anthony.</p>
<p>In a world driven primarily by the near term exigencies of campaign fund raising and getting reelected, it would seem like the fate of the BC3 is sealed, with the death penalty or life imprisonment sure to follow the extradition hearing this June.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the prevailing political survivalist mentality, I believe that there is something lurking in the backs of our minds - a distinct uneasiness that Canada would be surrendering home grown civil rights advocate of significant import, effectively condemning him death for something that is inconsequential within Canada.</p>
<p>The long term consequences of cooperating with the DEA witch hunt would relegate Canada to the status of Panama, Columbia, and Bolivia, where U.S. intelligence efforts and overt political influence all but fully usurped sovereignty in the name of conformity.</p>
<p>It seems likely that our uneasiness is not rooted in concern for life itself or freedom of expression, or even a chance for liberty to grid against oppression on a level playing field.  More likely, it's the degree to which penalties are disproportionate to the 'crime', that any man's life might be traded for any policy, or perhaps it's the prospect of martyring a recognized civil rights leader in the name of good relations.</p>
<p>The unfortunate consequence of cooperation with the DEA is that Canada's sell out price includes Marc's life's work too. Few people have the necessary daring to risk financial security and personal freedom to fight for others' liberties - it's anti-Darwinian.  Extraditing the BC3 south of the 49th will mean Canada, perhaps all of North America will have to wait for another self-sacrificing genetic anomaly to be born before another champion can take up the issue.</p>
<p>So many people lose if Ottawa doesn't stand up to Washington.  The consequences will echo decades after the BC3 are convicted.  Oddly, neither Canada, nor the U.S. will have achieved anything beyond execution of policy. Other seed vendors already supply those who can no longer buy from Marc Emery Direct Seeds, so this is really not about stemming the supply, it's about stifling a conscientious objector, gagging an activist, making an example of anyone that dares to walk unarmed toward an armed fortress carrying a banner.</p>
<p>If people really understood that we're talking about cooperating with an avalanche - a mindless, inexorable force of executive authority unleashed over forty years ago, regularly burying survivalists clinging to the edge of the mountain.  That force is mindless in its intent, ruthless within its own borders, ignorant of relevant research.  Do we really want to sacrifice Canadians to this dragon?  If encouraged, this will certainly be just the beginning of a mounting wave of intelligence gathering, prosecution, and extradition.</p>
<p>This hearing is an opportunity to repair the dike before smart bombs seek targets that further weaken national resolve.  Turn Uncle Sam back now, while he's still trying to maintain an air of cordiality.  Bolster Canadian sovereignty - just say no to the DEA.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Mike Landis</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>In my State last year more people died from prescription drug overdoses then illegal drugs. So how is it the truly dangerous drugs people are dying from are the ones that come from a pharmacy? Prescription Methadone killed more people then heroin did, and now that heroin is cheaper then beer, how do the drug warriors expect to beat that drug off the streets? The answer is they cannot. L.E.A.P. (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition) is a great organization, and the name is accurate, LEAP is composed of law enforcement professionals who know first hand what prohibition does and that prohibition is the true cause of gang violence, it's all down to the fact that once a substance is illegal it is no longer a "controlled substance" it becomes an out of control, unregulated substance, sold with no regard for purity, and doseage, or of the age of the end user. It becomes a crime issue only because it is unregulated, prohibition is the primary cause of the damage in our cities and communities, and the gangs fight over the money to be made on their "turf" wars. The DEA has no mission save for it's own survival as a strong arm for a corrupted "justice" system. Senator James Webb along with now democratic Senator Arlen Spector have sponcered and gotten through a major blue panel of experts to study where American Justice has gone wrong in this drug war, the prison/industrial complex is an enemy of freedom, and one that should be completely revised. Each day here in America, $30 million dollars is spent on prisons, a complete waste of resources spent in the misguided drug war. Every two weeks we add 9000 more beds to our jails and prisons, each day 75% of all criminal court cases deal with non violent drug offenses, which fill up at least 65% of our jails and prisons, mean while the Banksters and Wallstreet white collar criminals sit back and rake off trillions of looted money from Americans, not one major Bank CEO has even been investigated, indicted, and then arrested for the frauds, and bailout money runs down the bottomless pit of corrupt corporations black hole accounting systems, millions are out of jobs and losing their homes, retirement funds, and kids go without proper food and housing and medical care, and educations go for want, futures are being stolen right out from under hard working,tax paying families, in short the American dream has become the American nightmare, with no end in sight, and we continue to fight this 100 year drug war. I suggest looking up Senator James Webb on the web, I strongly suggest checking out L.E.A.P.'s website. I suggest together we can change America, as a people with compassion for others in these hard times, it is long past due that we clean out the failed policies of the past, and find new answers, illegal drugs are bad, but prohibition is even worse. Today and every day in my state 18 people will die on average from tobacco related illness, in one week that's 126 people every 7 days, that's over 6700 people a year, from legal tobacco. If tobacco kills so many people as a regulated product, then how can the drug warriors even be worried about the deaths caused by the drugs they choose not to regulate? DEA won't even address tobacco as the major silent killer in this county that it is, WHY? We all know why, MONEY. Again it's corrupt politicians and the corrupt corporations strangle hold on the taboo tobacco subject. The drug warrior's prohibition claims don't hold up as a concern for public health when you look at the facts of tobacco related deaths. They simply have another agenda, not of public health and safety, it's prison's and jails and the corrupted justice system they want to keep alive, and therefore their jobs. It's a machine that once started, has a life of it's own, for no other purpose but it's own existence.</p>
<p>Check out LEAP, and support drug law, and criminal law reform, it our country, if we don't like what it has become, it's time to change it.</p>

        <div class="content"><p>It is appalling that the mindset of the usa is back to the way it was in 1935. 85 years almost gone and past. 85 years that marijuana could of provided for our people and benefit the world as a whole. It's time Canada's parliament gets it's head out of it ass. Come on now! Watch the movie "The Union" Can the moral of the story be any clearer sounding english? Marc Emery I might not be your biggest fan but I am one of your biggest supporter's! Reverse this extradition before you become the usa's assman forever Canada. Wait my bad when haven't you been? 1970 when our money was worth more eh?</p>

        <div class="content"><p>Hey Marc. Ive been learning about you and your fight to legalize marijuana. I believe that the U.S. government keeps marijuana criminalized because of its own political and mostly economical agendas. The majority of the public in the U.S. is misinformed about marijuana and its effects. I believe that what they have done to you, your wife, and your friends is immoral and unjust. keep fighting the good fight and ill do what i can from down here in the states to correctly inform people and fight to end the marijuana prohibition! </p>
<p>yours truly and good luck,<br />

        <div class="content"><p>I truly appreciate what you have done for every pro-cannabis person in the world. You have sacrificed your life to deal with many hardships and complete bullshit from the judicial system. I got busted for minor shit and it derailed my life for over a year. I could not fathom how much trouble you have gone through just to stand up for your beliefs. The truth is we live in an ignorant world run by leaders that typically are unreasonable. Marijuana is a plant grown from the ground that has medicinal uses just like any other drug without the additives and proven to be more effective in most cases. Where is the freedom in that? Denying a solution to pain, anxiety, insomnia, and other ailments is just simply stupid. Thank you sir.</p>

        <div class="content"><p>It is an entire waste of time to comment on stupidity and very obvious DEA posters. Please do not allow yourself to get angered by these antagonistic remarks. These remarks are not being made by your average American or average person for that matter. They are almost always being made by paid DEA personnel and should always be ignored as much as possible. Trust me, arguing with a paid brick is like arguing with a dead vulture.<br />
The only one who gains is the dead vulture.<br />
These people are paid to disrupt. Just like they were in 1945 in Nazi Germany. We have come so far!</p>
<p>I would like to heighten everyone's awareness to the fact that Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams are also victims and need much support. They may be even more innocent than Marc,<br />
in their very nature, as generous and ambivalent persons.<br />
I am 100% behind Marc, but these two need our attention as well. They will suffer most by the hand of the Nazis in power in the Christian Right led USA.</p>
<p>If you are wondering about the Christian Right, they have some very distinguished mentors and Adolph Hitler was one of their best.</p>
<p>I am not anti-christian. I am anti anything and anyone that forces their beliefs or principles upon others, for the sake of their own ideological perception of good. So, wouldn't I have made a great American Founding Father?</p>
<p>Let's all pray and send our heartfelt support to these three wonderful people in their time of need. Pray in what ever way you are accustomed to.<br />
I belong to no organized religion but my prayers are equally as strong as anyone in any faith.<br />
Prayer is not only for those who believe in God or Buddha, Mohamed, or Christ. Prayer is the power of Intent and turning that energy into a force of good, for creation.<br />
That being said. Pray for more awareness, and more funding, for all three of these people in their hour of need. And if you have to skip a meal at some convenient place to discover the 3-4$ then so be it. Just remember where to send it and that it is for a GOOD cause, and if you so believe, a GOD cause.</p>
<p>I forgot. Please, please, write everyone listed above and get any friends that you know or family involved as well. If you do not have the monies to contribute use some of your time instead, and get a few other people aware of the inhumane actions and activities that are going on right now, today!<br />
If we, as people, do not unite and give our support, worldwide, to these three unfortunate individuals, then we might as well keep on allowing the money funded Nazis take power and tell us what to do and where to piss everyday of our lives from here on until we perish.</p>

<p> Well.. I have to agree with you.. it's not worth argueing with a DEA agent, and the remarks aren't made by an Average American.. since I'm not an American, or a DEA agent.. I'm a Canadian, from Marks hometown of London Ontario... and I can assure you, I'm far from average...<br />
 And rule of thumb.. the minute you invoke Hitler, or Nazism to justify an argument.. you've already lost it. That's a cowards way to argue.. </p>
<p> Since your post, there's a new regime in power in the US, and Marc is still going to do the time... his 2 co-accused are free, with very little punishment.. Marc manned up, and took it like a man.<br />
 And as I've stated before.. I'm in full support of legalizing pot.. it would do great for the economy, and has it's uses for medical reasons.. I just want the idiot to pay the time for doing the crime.</p>

        <div class="content"><p>Hi, Marc,<br />
It took a lot of courage for you to bring the legalization movement this far in a relatively short time.  Anyone who can weather jail time after telling a government that its policies are harmful is a rare breed of patriot.  Thank you for opening my eyes to so much in just the last two and a half years since my mother died from alcohol-related brain damage.  It was the beginning of learning, "What's legal kills, what benefits is illegal."  Cancer patients I knew also made me aware of the need for better treatment, natural being far better than anything manmade.  I've learned more about my own family after studying what you write and watching your interviews on YouTube - my mother never told me about the Harrison Act of 1914 - Francis Burton Harrison was only mentioned as the Governor General of the Philippines, and I'll never know why his bill controling drugs was kept a family secret for almost a century. I'm spending more time than ever trying to undo the damage done by one of my ancestors.  I hope you will still be able to avoid further persecution, and I do believe in miracles.  Thank you, again, for showing me "the way."  Sincerely, Bob</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>First to mention - I have not known about Marc Emery before recently, surfing the internet on information about ... well pot culture. Im amazed that ANYBODY could convict such a wonderful person. It's completely lunatic to even think of throwing this man into prison for doing absolutely nothing wrong. Its true when he states that its not harmful in any way. In a statistic made by some english scientists they claim that only some drugs is the cause behind people going totally insane in weekends - and im not surprised that alcohol was the worst on their charts. But even with that kind of information straight from most brainy people on this planet - nobody does anything about that problem. I wont go into discussion about how to solve that problem, because it would be like telling a dead road accident never to cross the road again. I mean - if there was ANY scientific proof of pot being dangerous they would probably be too stupid to even use that as an argument. Thank god (and im not even a believer) we don't have such ignorant politicians in my country. By god what stupidity. I mean - what kind of mindless mongol country makes their own countrymen criminals by inforcing a law that that costs so much money? I mean - if you really want to fuck up your country this is the best way to do it. No question about that.</p>

Thanks for being such a great succsess and advocate for legalization,(where from do you get those seeds anyway? lol) I'm in BC too,the pot capitol of the world!

<p>You are true peace activists &amp; we love you for representing us.. </p>

        <div class="content"><p>Obviously he knew what he was getting himself into - but why would he bother unless it was for a good cause? He has strong beliefs and what he is doing is something so many people would not even be brave enough to try. There is nothing wrong with a ton of people being on his side and wanting him to be okay and not be sent to jail. Also I think you are missing the point that he is being sent to the US when they have no right to steal a friendly Canadian away from us for not harming ANYONE. I would like to believe that breaking an unjust law is something we all do or wish to do more often - there are a lot of stupid, stupid "laws" out there. He is doing nothing wrong and doesn't deserve this.</p>

        <div class="content"><p>So it really was the drug czar heckling incident which ultimately led to Emery's downfall. One month later the investigation began and eventually was handed over to the DEA. Right after the heckling, which could very easily have been anticipated to result in a whole lot of heat, Marc should have cleaned everything out and moved the seed sales to another location entirely. Instead, he just kept on doing business as usual. Can't imagine why he did that, but he's a big boy and if he doesn't mind prison I guess that's his choice.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>Look, If you want to free Marc Emery one need look no further than "Solutions in Commerce".</p>
<p>Look, I don't mean to be rude - because up until a few years ago... I didn't know this stuff either.</p>
<p>Until I started to read and understand Solutions in Commerce I thought I knew law - turns out I didn't even know ENGLISH! And I'm only getting started, as a group we might be able to get him out!</p>
<p>For all of you who think I might be wrong... contemplate this:</p>
<p>How would you plea in his position...</p>
<p>a) Not Guilty?<br />
b) Deal? (Guilty with explanation)<br />
c) Innocent?<br />
d) Guilty?<br />
e) None of the above</p>
<p>If you answered A) - you're automatically in contempt, the court may hear what you and your lawyer have to say, but it won't matter unless they feel like it.. thanks for playing.</p>
<p>B) Same as A) pretty much, except you understand that they're going to do what they want and you hope to get a less crappy bargain.</p>
<p>C) Innocent, innocent no longer exists - there is only guilty and not guilty and variations thereof... innocent is in the movies.</p>
<p>D) Guilty... getting warmer... but not quite.</p>
<p>E) None of the above! Yay - that's the answer and that's because!</p>
<p>YOU WANT TO BE GUILTY! Huh? The only way to plea and truly win in court in the common wealth (including Canada and the US) is pleading GUILTY TO THE FACTS.</p>
<p>Why? because that is saying that you are willing to settle the matter based on the facts. That's what Guilty means: "I will settle the accounts". </p>
<p>Ok - here it is and it's free:</p>
<p><a href="http://dl.btjunkie.org/torrent/Winston-Shrout-Solutions-in-Commerce-Kelowna-BC-8-DVD-s/37800b40527ea2240cbd09d347cfa0e40619eec6c4cf/download.torrent" title="http://dl.btjunkie.org/torrent/Winston-Shrout-Solutions-in-Commerce-Kelowna-BC-8-DVD-s/37800b40527ea2240cbd09d347cfa0e40619eec6c4cf/download.torrent">http://dl.btjunkie.org/torrent/Winston-Shrout-Solutions-in-Commerce-Kelo...</a></p>
<p>That's a torrent link to an 8 DVD seminar Winston Shrout did in BC - watch it... and try to set Marc Free with it - it's the best way.</p>
<p>Here's Shrout's home page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.winstonshroutsolutionsincommerce.com/" title="http://www.winstonshroutsolutionsincommerce.com/">http://www.winstonshroutsolutionsincommerce.com/</a></p>
<p>But I'm not suggesting you spend money anywhere - watch the DVD set I just shared and do what you can.</p>

It is only the people, the ordinary citizen who pays the price. The government authorities are immune to prosecution because the people of Canada and the USA are too complacent to do anything about these things. Marc has been victimized by these authorities, and the people sit by and do nothing. I believe we in Canada and the USA are getting dangerously close to an uprising of the people.

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>If you've been victimized by said authorities then you need to realize that the only reason they can do so is because they enjoy the benefits of "PUBLIC OFFICE" this gives them a bond, which is like an insurance policy. If you put a bond in place to protect yourself (Solutions in Commerce) - see the post above. Then you can do something about it.</p>
<p>Basically we're all going to court against these guys and bringing a knife to a gun fight. They have bonds in a courtroom where not having a bond is automatic contempt. They won't tell you that tho, because they want to do the song and dance to rob us of our money. Sometimes you get justice usually you loose a lot of cash in the process to your lawyer.</p>
<p>Take them out of the mix, get a bond, fire your lawyer - make their lawyer fiduciary debtor.. call upon the judges oath - enter in facts from the floor and force the judge to rule based on the facts (by his oath). When he or any other PUBLIC official does not perform their office... use your unlimited bond to FIRE THEM.</p>
<p>I can't do these things for you - and I'm not out there getting these so called authorities riled up, I lay low for my own reasons... but if you have or you know someone who has get them to watch videos with "Winston Shrout" on google and youtube or download them or go buy them from his site and play their game and win.</p>

        <div class="content"><p>Here's a guy, who sold mail order pot seeds, totally out in the open, hurting no one, and who in fact, filed and paid huge taxes each year to a willing and grateful receiving Canadian government. Business as usual, right?</p>
<p>But now, didn't that rub a little shit up the nose of the American DEA? After all, it was the AMERICAN'S who provided the bulk of the business, with their insatiable thirst for BC bud. So the swollen ranks of these DEA scum, with nothing better to do than justify their own immoral existence on OUR southern border, as if they haven't got enough work keeping busy bashing Mexican heads on their own southern border, make Harper cringe at their stinkin' feet for having the audacity to not crucify Emery sooner, just to save some ugly face. "Better yet Steve, just hand him over to US. Not to worry. We'll make sure he's taken real good care of in some dumbed down backwater, like Alabama, where he can get life in prison at the drop of a kkk noose".</p>
<p>So of course OUR chicken shit government, upon being told what's what by their daddies down south, offers up Emery faster than Jesus was given up by HIS old man. So then, being that Revenue Canada was "in on it" all these years, why the fuck aren't THOSE assholes handed over right along with Emery? Willing accomplices should be held just as responsible as our so-called 'perp', right?</p>

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>My "Letter to the Editor" </p>
<p>The time has come to legalize marijuana, tax it, and create a few hundred thousand jobs. Marc Emery is currently waiting to see if we will let the US extradite him, to face a possible life sentence for selling seeds on the internet.</p>
<p>44% of Canadians have admitted to smoking weed, leading to the obvious conclusion that millions of Canadians currently possess marijuana seeds. If you mailed a couple seeds to your friend in the US in a Christmas card, should you face a possible life sentence in prison? </p>
<p>Marc Emery should get a noble peace prize for his work.<br />
He has helped alleviate much pain and suffering. He has given people the means to grow their own medical marijuana so they don't have to interact with drug dealers. Many "Mom and Pop" grow operations were started with his seeds, reducing the market share of organized crime, and their profits.</p>
<p>Many cancer patients can't afford medical marijuana in the US but can afford seeds, the same as in Canada.  People have used his seeds to grow marijuana for compassion clubs, some of which gave it away freely to chemotherapy patients.</p>
<p>Marc's seeds have helped many family farms. When pork and beef prices crashed, some farmers were loosing money, trying to keep food on OUR tables. Some turned to growing marijuana as a means of survival.</p>
<p>For his contribution in taxes, and the huge amount he has given to charities,  the pain and suffering that has been eased, are we will really going let the US Government extradite him? One of our legendary heroes?</p>
<p>Sadly I doubt he will get the Peace Prize, it isn't like he sent thousands of troops off to war.</p>
<p>The 6797 Proposal (6797.com) recommends making labour intensive services tax deductible, Small Market Media Tax Credit, Legalizing and Taxing marijuana and NOT letting the US extradite Marc Emery for a possible life sentence. </p>
<p>To help get our message out, we have created an activist portal, where Canadians can make their voices heard (more features coming soon), available at 6797.com/portal.php </p>
<p>We would all like the power to deny certain businesses/industries the right to exist based on our own personal morals/beliefs, banks come to mind. The reality is marijuana has been around for thousands of years and won't go away any time soon. Do we really want to keep spending millions of dollars on marijuana prohibition, or would society be better served by regulating the industry, taxing it, keeping people safe and creating jobs? </p>

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>Thanks marc,you have done so much for the cause,I'm proud to be a Canadian knowing we have such great People like you who fight so much for our freedom.</p>
<p>I to have been persecuted only they did it in such a way as to make my loved ones think I am nuts and now I have been discredited by them.</p>
<p>I tried to explain it at blogger but Twice the rcmp came and harassed and threated to arrest me because of it so I took it offline untill I have completed explaining all that they did to me.<br />
I will then place it back online when complete(soon)then they will come and arrest me or better yet they will try to place me in pych ward because they are trying to keep this out of the media and the courts.<br />
The police know for a fact marc that I can solve the murders of abducted and tortured/murdered children but have been waiting quitely for many years for peacefull people like you marc to legalize marijuana.<br />
They know that I have abilities others don't and so they try to get me to flip out at them so they don't have to answer to the persecution charges.<br />
They keep trying to find a reason to take me away and it is only a matter of time before they come back and harass me again.</p>
<p>The ministry for children and the police spied on me and my home the entire time my wife and I were foster parents.<br />
I went to a friends bedside when he was dying of cancer and told him I would watch his two boys and we did very well with them but they set out to destroy the relationship and persecute and destroy my life.<br />
I was once a volunteer for the red cross and emergency social services but resigned because they to help police carry out the persecution.<br />
They destoyed my chances of ever taking over my fathers roofing company and I am now making plans to leave my wife and town because of the constant harassment from the police.<br />
My story is a long one marc by all means go to my INSANE BLOG at twoalberniserialkillers@blogger.com,as I have said it is offline now but soon when done it will be back online for all to see.</p>
<p>I need support and people who believe in me before I hand over everything it takes to solve the murder of children.<br />
America will not take you away marc and if they do then I will have something to say about that.</p>
<p>The rcmp are corrupt cowards who cannot confess to their wrong doings so keep an eye on the news because they will have no choice but to arrest me and take me away all because of my writtings.</p>
<p>Thanks again marc for fighting so hard for the cause,love to sit down and smoke a joint with you sometime since I bet we could give each other some advice .</p>
<p>Now watch what I can do for the cause</p>

<p>he's going to jail for shipping an illegal product into the US. end of story.</p>
<p>he knew full well that whats happening to him now was a distinct, and very real possibility. did he not do any reading on what the US did during the "cocaine wars" of the 80s? they make a regular habit of extraditing into the US people who in many cases had never set a single foot on US soil for breaking US laws</p>
<p>do i think its right what is being done? no, of course not ... but he should have seen this coming and the fact that he's pissed away who knows how many dollars of donations fighting an extradition (that everyone with an ounce of common sense knew was going to happen anyways) is pretty telling ...</p>
<p>not to mention that he negotiated a plea deal that it now appears he's trying to get out of ... he better hope the judge doesn't turn around and say "ok, plea deal off the table ... now you can be sentenced to the full extent of the law" ... could turn his 5 year plea agreement into a hell of a lot longer stretch</p>

Emery's cause may actually receive more attention because of this than if he had played it safe.  One could view it as a very expensive (and painful) form of propagandizing.</p>

<p>This is the Noble Lie that WE ALL PAY FOR - We are the problem and the solution. Until We the People (not the sheeple) take ownership of OUR government (not the gov't) we are doomed to be enslaved by fascism.</p>

<p>"Mr. Long is charged with a law that is unconstitutional. Even though he himself is not in medical need of marijuana, it is certainly open to him to challenge the law on the basis that it is unconstitutional [2]  It is well within his right to argue that the current criminal prohibition is unconstitutional as it fails to provide a constitutional exemption for those in medical need – even though he is not one of those persons.  Having succeeded, he cannot be found guilty of a law that is unconstitutional. Therefore, the charges against him will be dismissed."</p>

They are changine the ads again (which I already paied for).  I'm still really sad about cannabis culture carrying the knock-offs of the Ubie (AmericanSmokeless.Com http://TheUbie.Com).<br />
I think they have been working this to my disadvantage and yourse.</p>
<p>I invented and patenteded the lighter vaporizer to sell it.  Not for them to follow me evryehre and rip me off.  I hope your case goes well.  I have no idea why all this is happening. But it hurts my business and I miss the ocasional chats.</p>
<p>Don't know if you have much time to write. But I hope so.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

        <div class="content"><p>i don't care what any one else says Mark is the king of the green and what the states are doing is wrong they are just jealous because they don't have any one as cool as mark and that is why i believe that the states want mark down the not were he belongs, Marc needs to be free we need him back in Canada without him this place is not the same and it will never be the same i use the green as meds for my mental problems and for my back problems but what about the other people in this world that can't get the gov. to help the i know there are others in this world that have it worst then me and they are being refused by the gov and i find that not just wrong but rude to other people that the only way that those people can kill there pain so they can try to live a normal life cant because of the gov. but its wrong. the states need to release Marc ASAP its not right what they are doing if it was up to me Marc would already be back in the arms of his loved ones but i am just one voice but if there are more people that help Marc like there already are even if its just words to the gov. it will show the world that people will stand for what they believe is right and the more there is the more we can do and i hope if every one put at least one step towards helping Marc i'm sure that we can make that state change there mind and let Marc back to Canada and spend the rest of his time here, but even better would be if the states would set him free and let Marc get on with his life then maybe this world would stop the war because we are all stoned and when you are stoned you don't want to fight and if it works out the will be no need for the cops or for gangs or even better there will be no reason for guns we will all be stoned and then we can all live in peace. and thats all i have to say for now. if the cops have a problem with what i just said then they can come take me away but i wont go with out a fight i'm sorry but what the gov is doing is 100% wrong.</p>

        <div class="content"><p>To Marc Emery and My Northern Neighbours, </p>
<p>My country (the US) continues to live up to its history of imperialism and demagoguery, and in this case, Mark Emery and Canada has paid the price. The DEA has no right to supersede state laws regarding marijuana legalization, as it continually does, and certainly has no right to operate in Canada. Canada, do not allow your sovereign country's leaders bow to the oppressive U.S. sphere of influence.</p>

No mention of Pink's outstanding performance--twirling and splashing water on all the celebs (help I'm melting) Her voice never quivered.

        </div>

        <div class="content"><p>For those of you who think pot is a horrible drug and the people that think drug users should die think of this... The definition of a drug is any substance that alters the body or mind of an individual. This would mean sugar and caffine are the first drugs people are introduced to and more people need that fix but it legal. If you want to stop being poisoned stop drinking the water with sodium flouride. Sodium flouride was introduced into the Nazi Concentration Camps in 1936. Our own CIA used sodium flouride in mind control experiments because any form of flouride can be used as a mind control angent. And they have been pumping it I to our water for years. The government is out to poison us and profit from us. Do some research and conect the dots. Use your logic and common sense to see the truth. Smoking and drinking kill more people than all other drugs combined. More people die of starvation in this world than by drugs, yet the richest people have private jets doing drugs banging hookers and eating caviar. All the while letting us fight amongst ourselves for the scraps they done want. 3% of the world's population owns 98% of the world's wealth, there is seriously something wrong with that!</p>
<p>Marc I wish you the best of luck! There is nothing wrong with standing up for what you believe is right! Yet they are trying to make it a crime. Please free Marc people and open your eyes!</p>

        <div class="content"><p>The main issues with the legalization of marijuana is the U.S. government admitting they were wrong about criminalizing cannabis. Get over it and make it legal, the government is missing out on some serious funds and needs to stop the violence over a plant... aspirin ,also from a plant, is available to kids in any store that sells it and has killed more kids than marijuana which has not caused any deaths, wtf.</p>
