<center><b>What you don't know about electrical pollution can hurt you!</b></center>
<p>
In the laboratory, chronic exposure to low level electromagnetic fields clearly affects growth and development, stress response, immune response and many neurological functions.  This is not surprising because at the cellular level we are all electrical beings.  Epidemiologic studies relate electromagnetic fields to birth defects, psychosis, childhood leukemias and to other cancers, especially brain and reproductive tumors. 
<p>
<center><b>What are the symptoms of radio wave sickness?</b></center>
<p>
From the first awareness of health effects related to electromagnetic radiation decades ago, non-localized neurological symptoms have been very prominent.  These include:<b> headaches, dizziness, nausea, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, weakness, tremors, muscle spasms, numbness, tingling, altered reflexes, muscle and joint pain, leg/foot pain, "Flu-like" symptoms and fever. </b> More severe symptoms can include seizures, paralysis, psychosis and stroke.  These complaints, along with numerous non-specific multiple systems symptoms, constitute radio wave sickness.
<p>
<center><b>When should you suspect radio wave sickness?</b></center>
<p>
You should suspect radio wave sickness when you have a significant number of symptoms on the list and there does not seem to be another cause for the symptoms.  <b>Radio wave sickness should be suspected if you have chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia, attention deficit disorder, and multiple sclerosis as a number of people with those disorders have substantially recovered after being treated for it.</b>  Asthma, headaches-including migraines, blood sugar control, allergies, and sleep quality have all improved with reducing exposure to radiofrequencies.
<p>
<center><b>How can radio wave sickness be positively diagnosed?</b></center>
<p>
The extensive list of symptoms relates to the multiple cellular and sub-cellular effects of electrical pollution.  <a href="
 http://www.bioinitiative.org" target=new>The BioInitiative Report</a> is a comprehensive compilation of research on the extensive effects exposure to radiofrequencies has and is a good resource for those wanting a detailed scientific report.  Lab tests, including EEG (as described by Marha et al.) may be done as a baseline but are not definitive.   A simple meter provides  accurate measurements of electrical pollution in most situations.  In rare situations, frequencies are outside the meter effective range, in these situations measurements require specialized instrumentation and a trained technician to interpret the data.  The simultaneously diagnostic and therapeutic measure is to eliminate "dirty" power in the home and/or workplace and determine whether or not symptoms improve, often within days.    The filters to accomplish this need only be "plugged in," and are inexpensive when compared to multiple medical office visits and/or medications.  Please see the <a href="solutions.html">Solutions page</a> for more details on how to make your home safe from high frequencies.
<p>
The average home requires approximately twenty filters.  If improvement occurs only slowly, more filters may be necessary.  It is important to install enough from the beginning because if too few are installed initially, no difference may be observed.  Instructions for filter installation can be found at <a href="http://www.stetzerelectric.com/filters/filter_instructions.html" target=new> http://www.stetzerelectric.com/filters/filter_instructions.html</a>.  The instructions can be used to help estimate how many filters will be necessary for optimal filtering.

<p>
<center><b>Are there any other treatments?</b></center>
<p>
There are no treatments that can substitute for reducing or eliminating exposure to high frequencies.  However, there are some nutritional approaches that may be helpful in rebuilding the body's damaged systems after exposure high frequencies is substantially reduced or eliminated.  The literature indicate that the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, and the immune system are impaired or damaged by over-exposure to radio frequencies.  Many references cite oxidative damage as a problem.  Dehydration also seems to be a problem.  Consult with your physician or a qualified health care professional to determine what might be appropriate to help with recovery from the damage done by radio wave sickness.

<p>
In addition to being part of an electrical circuit because of the electrical earth currents, <b>each person is capacitively coupled to the wires running around them</b> through the walls, floor, and ceiling of the building where they live or work.  Electrical engineers know about capacitive coupling, but they have also been taught that the result is insignificant.  They have not read or choose to ignore publications like The Body Electric by Robert O. Becker, MD in which he discusses the extreme sensitivity of the human body to electromagnetic fields/radiation and Electromagnetic Fields and the Life Environment by Karel Marha, Jan Musil, and Hana Tuha in which they describe the symptoms humans experience with chronic exposure to high frequencies.  The description of the symptoms of exposure to high frequencies in Electromagnetic Fields and the Life Environment touches on all of the most minor and puzzling symptoms of CFS and Fibromyalgia, as well as all of the widely accepted ones.
<b>The symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and Gulf War Syndrome are all virtually identical to those of radio wave sickness.</b>  Exposure to high frequencies seems to be linked to a myriad of other  health problems including depression, attention deficit disorder (ADD), cancer, infertility, miscarriages, birth defects, allergies, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease.  The news has been full of speculation regarding why the rates of these ailments have increased over the last several years.  Since there is evidence linking exposure to high frequencies to each of these ailments, it seems likely that the growth in non-linear, time-varying loads relates to the increase of the ailments listed above. Until recently only a few people were aware of the source of the exposure. <b> People are becoming sick who do not seem to be at risk.</b>  Unbeknownst to them, they are being exposed to high frequencies through exposure to "dirty" power.  <b>Without an oscilloscope or a meter, it is impossible for the average person to detect.</b> (See the <a href="news.html">News page</a> for a more comprehensive article on the easy to use Microsurge Meter.)  Electricity is the most widely accepted and most poorly understood of the modern conveniences.
<p>
<center><b>Why is it difficult for physicians to accept electrical pollution's adverse health effects?</b></center>
<p>
	Regrettably, to date, articles in main-stream medical journals, featuring the human health risks of exposure to electrical pollution or high frequencies, have not received the notice they deserve.  Each time an article appears, a carefully prepared highly publicized study that reportedly shows inconclusive or negative results is released.  These studies have ties, generally funding, to an industry or organization that fears it would be negatively impacted by the new study.  These highly publicized, "damage control studies" are probably the ones you and your doctor recall seeing.
<p> 
Although the human health effects of exposure to high frequencies were well researched and documented in Eastern Europe over fifty years ago, this body of literature was largely disregarded because the government viewed it as communist propaganda designed to curtail the development of further military and/or technological advances.  Still, today Eastern Europe has some of the strictest regulations regarding acceptable levels of radio-frequency exposure for civilian populations.
<p>
Do not be put off by some of the hostile responses you may receive from medical professionals.  This information is new for your doctor.  This is where physics meets human biology.  The scarcity of people who are well enough versed in both physics and biology to fully understand the effects of high frequencies on biological organisms is what has allowed this problem to persist for so long.  There are a number of papers and resources available today for them to review.  A good place to start is <a href="

<center><b>Symptoms of radio wave sickness </b>
(excerpted from No Place To Hide April 2001):  </center>
<p>
<li>Neurological:  headaches, dizziness, nausea, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, weakness, tremors, muscle spasms, numbness, tingling, altered reflexes, muscle and joint paint, leg/foot pain, "Flu-like" symptoms, fever.  More severe reactions can include seizures, paralysis, psychosis and stroke.  
<li>Cardiac:  palpitations, arrhythmias, pain or pressure in the chest, low or high blood pressure, slow or fast heart rate, shortness of breath.  
<li>Respiratory:  sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma.  
<li>Dermatological:  skin rash, itching, burning, facial flushing.  
<li>Ophthalmologic:  pain or burning in the eyes, pressure in/behind the eyes, deteriorating vision, floaters, cataracts.  
<li>Others:  digestive problems; abdominal pain; enlarged thyroid, testicular/ovarian pain; dryness of lips, tongue, mouth, eyes; great thirst; dehydration; nosebleeds; internal bleeding; altered sugar metabolism; immune abnormalities; redistribution of metals within the body; hair loss; pain in the teeth; deteriorating fillings; impaired sense of smell; ringing in the ears.<br>
<p>
<center><b>Why is the symptoms list so broad?</b></center>
<p>
Symptoms are affected by body type, duration and regularity of exposure, and frequency (hertz).  Each frequency can have a very different effect on the human body and different body types are affected differently by different frequencies.  This makes electrical pollution as a causal agent difficult to identify, especially if you do not know about radio wave sickness.  One article in the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry notes that the stress response is activated in cells exposed to even low levels of electromagnetic radiation both by directly affecting DNA, as well as by activating membrane receptors.  They note that cells respond to amplitude and frequency differently. Changes of amplitude in either direction also stimulate the stress response.
