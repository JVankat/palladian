<h2>Abstract:<br></h2>
The present invention concerns improved configurations for a fuel cell
     army. The contacts for the positive electrode and the negative electrode
     are made outside the higher temperature active reaction space in a cooler
     area. Thus different more common materials are used which have a longer
     lifetime and have less stresses at their lower operating temperature. The
     invention utilizes tubular cell components connected with spines for
     efficient electron transfer and at least two manifolds outside the
     reaction zone, which may be cooled by external means. The external
     protruding connectors are thus at a lower operating temperature. This
     invention improves fuel cell life span, provides for lower cost, use of
     more common materials, and reduces the number thermal defects during
     operation.<h2>Claims:<br></h2>

<font size="+1"><b>CROSS</b></font>-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0001]</b>1. Field of the Invention
<BR><BR><b>[0002]</b>The present invention relates to a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)
     stack as disclosed herein that the stacking arrangement allows the cell
     to cell (or bundle to bundle) electrical connections to be made outside
     of the active hot-zone. The connections are cooled, and the materials may
     be selected from more common metals. Other attributes also exist for this
     new design. These include the reduction of residual stresses within the
     stack during operation due to the fuel cell symmetry, and the symmetry of
     the periodic arrangement of the cells.
<BR><BR><b>[0003]</b>The new design of the stacking of solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC),
     with either a circular, or elliptical cross-section as a bundle of
     hexagonal or triangular cross section is disclosed. For state of the art
     stack designs, the electrical connections between the individual cells
     must be located within the active hot zone of the cell stack. Therefore,
     these connections must be made of materials that are also stable in both
     oxidizing and reducing environments present. The current state of the art
     severely limits the economics and reliability of current stack designs.
     For example, the asymmetry of the three components and asymmetry of
     stresses lead to stress concentrations in the Westinghouse design. Also
     there is a lack of shape retention during cooling and heating in the
     planar stack design.
<BR><BR><b>[0004]</b>2. Description of Related Art
<BR><BR><b>[0005]</b>"Fuel cells are an important technology for a potentially wide
     variety of applications including micropower, auxiliary power,
     transportation power, stationary power for buildings and other
     distributed generation applications, and central power. These
     applications will be in a large number of industries worldwide" (as
     quoted from Dr. Mark C. Williams, Strategic Center for Natural Gas,
     National Energy Technology Laboratory, Fuel Cell Handbook, 6<sup>th</sup>
     Edition, DOE/NETL-2002/1179, 2003).
<BR><BR><b>[0006]</b>Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert the chemical
     energy of a reaction directly into electrical energy. One very important
     type of fuel cell is based on an oxide electrolyte. It is called a Solid
     Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC).
<BR><BR><b>[0007]</b>The basic physical structure, or building block, of a SOFC consists
     of a dense electrolyte layer that conducts oxygen ions in contact with a
     porous anode and a porous cathode on either side. The cathode is exposed
     to the gas containing oxygen (e.g., air or oxygen). It converts the
     oxygen molecules into oxygen ions and produces 4 electrons per oxygen
     molecule to the two ions created by the conversion. The negatively
     charged oxygen ions rapidly diffuse through the electrolyte, chemically
     driven to react with the fuel on the anode side of the cell, where they
     release the 4 electrons (per oxygen molecule). In some configurations, an
     SOFC uses a high temperature proton-conducting ceramic as an electrolyte.
     In such cases, protons transport from the anode, through the electrolyte,
     to the cathode. The electrolyte must be heated to a high temperature
     between about 600° C. to 1000° C. (depending on the
     electrolyte material) to achieve sufficient oxygen ion conductivity. This
     process generates voltage and/or an electrical current, depending upon
     the load. Voltage is generated when the two electrodes are not connected
     to one another, whereas current is generated when the two electrodes are
     connected, usually through a useful device such as a motor, light bulb,
     etc. Heat is generated by the reaction, and this heat is used to sustain
     the temperature needed to operate the SOFC. Excess heat is used to drive
     auxiliary devices (home heating, etc., etc.) When both the heat of the
     reaction and electrical energy are accounted for, the efficiency of this
     process can be as high as 80%. Thus, the SOFC is one of the most
     efficient devices to generate energy. When hydrogen is the fuel, the
     reaction product is simply clean, pure water, H<sub>2</sub>O. Thus, this SOFC
     has the potential to generate energy at a low cost and without polluting
     the environment.
<BR><BR><b>[0008]</b>In order to form a useful SOFC system, the basic building blocks are
     connected together to form a device that contains multiple cells,
     generally known as a stack. That is, the basic unit,
     cathode-electrolyte-anode must be connected to another, either in a
     series arrangement or a parallel arrangement, in the same manner that
     batteries are joined together either in series to produce a higher
     voltage (a multiple of the single battery voltage), or in parallel, to
     produce the same voltage as the single cell, but a larger current.
     Namely, the individual solid oxide fuel cells must be connected together
     to form a stack of cells.
<BR><BR><b>[0009]</b>As detailed below, the individual cells of the art are
     conventionally stacked with one of two different arrangements. In both
     systems, the electrical connections between the cells must be made in
     locations where much of the heat is generated, that is, the connections
     within the stack are made in a high temperature region. The need in
     current stacks for high temperature connections requires that the
     connecting material be stable at high temperatures, and stable in both
     oxidizing (cathode side) and reducing (anode side) environments. These
     special high temperature material requirements severely limit the
     operational efficiency and reliability of current stack designs.
<BR><BR><b>[0010]</b>On the other hand, as shown below, the new SOFC stack design as
     disclosed in this invention does not have these limitations. Instead,
     because of the unique design of each novel cell, and the unique method of
     stacking cells next to one another, the connection between the adjacent
     cells is made with air (or water) cooled metal connectors. This novel
     SOFC stack design also has other advantages relative to current designs
     that are provided in more detail below.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>SOFC Components and Materials</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0011]</b>SOFC major components include the anode, the cathode, and the
     electrolyte. Fuel cell stacks contain an electrical interconnect that
     links adjacent cells together in series. SOFC components must meet
     certain general requirements in order to be useful. Electrolytes,
     electrodes and interconnects must be chemically, morphologically, and
     dimensionally stable in oxidizing and/or reducing environments. The
     component material must be chemically stable in order to limit chemical
     interactions and degradation with other cell materials. They must have
     similar thermal expansion coefficients in order to minimize thermal
     stresses that could cause cracking and delaminating during thermal
     cycling. It is also desirable that fuel cell components have high
     strength and durability, are easy to fabricate, and are relatively
     inexpensive.
<BR><BR><b>[0012]</b>Materials that rapidly conduct oxygen ions (O<sup>-2</sup>) can be used as
     solid electrolyte. The most commonly used electrolyte material for SOFCs
     is zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), where a fraction of the zirconium ions
     (Zr<sup>+4</sup>) is substituted with yttrium ions (Y<sup>+3</sup>). This electrolyte
     material is generally known as yttrium oxide (or yttria) stabilized
     zirconium oxide (or zirconia) (YSZ). YSZ is a preferred electrolyte
     material for SOFCs because it exhibits predominantly ionic (oxygen)
     conductivity over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures. The
     conductivity of oxygen ions is provided by the oxygen vacancies () that
     are introduced when Y<sup>+3</sup> substitutes for Zr<sup>+4</sup> into the
     Zr(Y)O<sub>2</sub> crystalline structure represented by the chemical formula,
     Zr.sub.(1-x)Y<sub>x</sub>O.sub.(2-x/2)<sub>x</sub>/2, were x is the atomic fraction
     of Y substituted for Zr.
<BR><BR><b>[0013]</b>Lanthanum strontium manganite, (La,Sr)MnO<sub>3</sub>, (LSM), which has
     the perovskite structure, has been the most frequently used material for
     the cathode in SOFCs. Its thermal expansion coefficient matches well with
     zirconia electrolytes and provides good performance at temperatures above
     800° C. The incorporation of up to 40 volume % or more of the
     electrolyte material (YSZ) into the cathode materials has been shown to
     improve electrode performance at lower temperatures by increasing the
     number of active sites available for electrochemical reactions.
<BR><BR><b>[0014]</b>Anode materials for SOFCs are commonly fabricated from composite
     powder mixtures of electrolyte materials, YSZ and nickel oxide. The
     nickel oxide is subsequently reduced to nickel metal prior to operation
     of the SOFC. The NiO/YSZ anode material is suited for applications with
     YSZ electrolytes. Typical anode materials have nickel contents of
     approximately 40 volume % after reduction of the nickel oxide to nickel.
<BR><BR><b>[0015]</b>State-of-the-Art SOFC Stack Designs--This section reviews the
     state-of-the-art of the two different SOFC stack designs, namely the
     tubular Siemens-Westinghouse SOFC stack and planar SOFC stack, commonly
     know as PSOFCs.
<BR><BR><b>[0016]</b>Tubular SOFC Stacks--FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate a single cell 10 &
     11 of the Siemens-Westinghouse tubular design of the conventional art,
     and FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate how the cells 20 & 21 are stacked
     together. Each tube 10 shown in FIG. 1A is formed with the following
     sequence. A thick, strong supporting tube is first made of the cathode
     material (LSM) by extruding LSM powder mixed with a plastic binder
     followed by sintering. The cathode tube is fabricated with a porosity of
     30 to 40% to permit rapid transport of the incoming oxidant gas
     (O<sub>2</sub>+N<sub>2</sub>) and depleted oxidant gas to and away from the
     cathode/electrolyte interface where the electrochemical reactions occur.
     The YSZ electrolyte is applied to the cathode tubes by electrochemical
     vapor deposition (EVD) method, which for many years has been the heart of
     Westinghouse (now Siemens-Westinghouse) technology. Recently,
     Siemens-Westinghouse switched over to a new process, termed atmospheric
     plasma spray deposition instead of the EVD process. The NiO/YSZ (or
     zirconia stabilized by some other oxide) mixed anode material is
     subsequently formed on the electrolyte by a slurry deposition method
     followed by sintering, and then by the reduction of the NiO to Ni, to
     form the porous Ni/ZrO<sub>2</sub> anode. The support tube is closed at one
     end, which eliminates the need for gas seals when the cells are connected
     together.
<BR><BR><b>[0017]</b>FIG. 1A shows that both the YSZ electrolyte 4 and the Ni/ZrO<sub>2</sub>
     anode 6 do not fully circumscribe the external surface of the tube 2, but
     instead, are arranged to produce a region that is exposed to the cathode
     tube. As shown in FIG. 1A, this exposed region is filled with an
     `interconnect` material 8, generally a dense, lanthanum chromite
     (LaCrO<sub>3</sub>), which as a material is stable in both an oxidizing and a
     reducing environment. When the tubes are stacked together (see FIG. 2A)
     the interconnect material 8 connects the cathode of one cell to the anode
     of an adjacent cell.
<BR><BR><b>[0018]</b>Air 25 (and thus oxygen) is introduced into the interior of each
     tube 2, and fuel gas 27 flows past the anode 6 on the exterior of each
     cell. FIG. 2B shows a bundle of eighteen cells that features 3 cells in
     series with 6 cells in parallel. Also shown is the nickel felt 9 that is
     used to make electrical connections within the hot zone 29 of the stack.
     That is, the nickel felt connects the interconnect region to the anode of
     adjacent cells and also connects the anode of a cell to the anode of an
     adjacent cell. It also connected the cathode bus 22 and the anode bus 26
     to the stack.
<BR><BR><b>[0019]</b>Alternative Tubular Design--Alternative tubular designs are pursued
     by many developers, such as Acumentrics (see
     http://www.acumentrics.com/). These are anode-supported cells with a
     thin, dense electrolyte layer on the outer surface, upon which is
     deposited porous cathode. Usually, silver paint is applied on the cathode
     surface, and a silver wire is wound on the silver paint, to minimize
     sheet resistance and facilitate current collection. The cost and
     evaporation of silver are significant challenges, which limit the utility
     of this design to niche applications.
<BR><BR><b>[0020]</b>Planar SOFC Stacks (PSOFC)--In the planar configuration, the anode,
     electrolyte, and cathode form thin, flat layers that are sintered
     together. The plates can be either rectangular, square, circular, or
     segmented in series and can be manifolded for air and fuel flow either
     externally or internally.
<BR><BR><b>[0021]</b>Currently available PSOFC designs are categorized on the basis of
     the supporting component. The two approaches are either electrolyte
     supported, or anode supported; the anode supported design of a single
     planar cell is shown in FIG. 3 (e.g., 3A & 3B). The electrolyte 34 and
     interconnect layers are made by tape casting. The electrodes are applied
     by the slurry method, by screen-printing, or by plasma spraying.
<BR><BR><b>[0022]</b>In order to produce significant amounts of power, PSOFC elements are
     assembled into a stack analogous to a multi-layered sandwich. Individual
     cell assemblies, each including an anode 36, electrolyte 34, and cathode
     32 are stacked with metal interconnecting plates between them. The metal
     plates 33, known as bipolar plates, are shaped to permit the flow of fuel
     and air to the membranes. The bipolar plate is essential for the
     so-called "stacking" of planar fuel cells; it not only connects the anode
     of one cell to the cathode of the next, but also separates the flow of
     air along the surface of the cathode, and the flow of fuel along the
     surface of the anode. One material candidate for the bipolar plate is
     ferritic stainless steel. However, a significant issue with this material
     is evaporation of a chromium hydrous oxide into the electrodes--degrading
     their performance. In addition, virtually all nickel-chromium-iron-based
     alloys undergo oxidation in both cathodic and anodic environments, with
     the oxide scale being usually a poor conductor of electricity. This added
     resistance, which increases with time of operation, lowers the overall
     power and efficiency.
<BR><BR><b>[0023]</b>To properly manifold the flow of air and fuel, the cell, including
     the bipolar plates, must be stacked sealed to one another. The
     requirements for stack seal materials are extremely stringent. Chemical
     compatibility of the seal material with the stack components and gaseous
     constituents of the highly oxidizing and reducing environments is also of
     primary concern. In addition, the seal should be electrically insulating
     to prevent shorting within the stack. Glass and glass-ceramic materials
     are the principal seal materials. The two issues of concern are the
     brittle nature of glass ceramics, and glasses tend to react with other
     cell components, such as electrodes, at SOFC operating temperatures. An
     alternative to glass is the use of mechanical, compressive, non-bonding
     seals. This approach permits the individual stack components to freely
     expand and contract during thermal cycling. However, the use, such as, of
     compressive seals also brings several new challenges to SOFC stack
     design; a load frame must be included to maintain the desired level of
     compressive load during operation. Also sealing efficiency is generally
     less than desired.
<BR><BR><b>[0024]</b>FIG. 4 is a photograph of a conventional PSOFC stack 40. One major
     technical difficulty with these structures is the generation of
     non-symmetric stresses in each cell. That is, because the materials
     within each cell have different thermal expansion coefficients, each
     cell, if initially flat, will try to curl when either heated or cooled.
     Curling of one cell will be constrained by the adjacent cell. Stresses
     will develop due to this constraint.

<br><br><font size="+1"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0125]</b>As is shown in the figures, particularly in FIGS. 5A, 5B and 5C, the
     cross section of individual tubular solid oxide fuel cell that is the
     basic element that comprises the disclosed novel design. Although those
     shown in FIGS. 5A, 5B and 5C have a circular cross section, their
     cross-section need not be circular. The tubes have any length, but the
     length to diameter ratio should not exceed a limit where the stress on
     the outer surface of the tube, produced by bending when the tube is not
     fully supported, exceeds the strength of the tube. In addition, the tubes
     cannot be of indefinite length in order to minimize voltage losses
     associated with the resistance to transporting electrical current along
     the length of the tube.
<BR><BR><b>[0126]</b>The tubes are formed with the porous anode and cathode materials
     that sandwich the dense electrolyte material 55. The porous anode
     material 52 is either the inner surface (inner diameter) of the tube
     (thus the cathode 51 is the outer material), or the outer surface (outer
     diameter) of the tube; either configuration is acceptable. Of course, if
     the inner surface is the porous anode material, the outer surface must be
     the porous cathode material 51, or vice versa. On the other hand,
     different from the SOFC tubes used in the Westinghouse (now
     Siemens-Westinghouse) design, all three materials (porous anode and
     porous cathode, and electrolyte) circumscribe the tube in the design
     disclosed here. (As shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D, only one of the
     three materials, e.g., the porous cathode material 2, circumscribes the
     tube in the Westinghouse design. In the Westinghouse design, because the
     connection between the cells in the stack are made within the hot active
     zone 29 of the stack itself, the other components, i.e., electrolyte 4
     and porous anode 6, only partially circumscribes the tube so that an
     interconnect material 8 is connected from the inner porous electrode 2
     (cathode) to the outer porous electrode 6 (anode) of the adjacent cell.
     In the current design, where all materials circumscribe the tube, the
     connections (namely, the interconnects) between the cells or bundles are
     made at the ends of the cell, not along their length as in the
     Westinghouse design. It is very important that the connections between
     the cells are made at the ends of the tubes, either with a connection
     directly to the porous electrodes, or to dense or porous spines that
     connect to the porous electrode materials as is discussed below.
     Interconnects, being outside the hot zone 29, are cooled to a lower
     temperature and thus are capable of being made of a good thermal and
     electrical conductor, e.g., copper.
<BR><BR><b>[0127]</b>In all cell designs, strains and stresses develop both during
     fabrication and during normal operation. These strains and stresses
     develop due to the different properties of the three materials that
     comprise the anode, the cathode and the electrolyte. During processing,
     each of the three materials may have a different shrinkage strain as
     powders that form the different components are made either stronger or
     denser during heating. Stresses sufficient to extend small cracks within
     the powder can cause larger defects that extend as cracks and cause
     delamination to occur during the heating process. Just as important, the
     strains and stresses that arise within each of the layers that form the
     tube are a problem when the tubes are cooled from the processing
     temperature and when they are thermal cycled during use as a fuel cell.
     These stresses generally arise due to the different thermal expansion
     (contraction) coefficients of each material, relative to one another.
<BR><BR><b>[0128]</b>One advantage of the tubular design disclosed herein, where all
     three materials circumscribe the tube, is that the continuous layers of
     the three different materials will produce a symmetric stress
     distribution, namely a condition were the stresses do not change from one
     place to another around the circumference of the tube. For the
     Westinghouse tube design, where only one of the three materials
     circumscribes the tube and two of the layers only partially circumscribe
     the tube and end abruptly, larger stresses arise where the layers
     terminate at an edge. On the other hand, the conventional Westinghouse
     tubes have a fourth material, the interconnect material 8 as shown in
     FIGS. 1A and 1B, this fourth material and its connection with the others
     give rise to stresses which are not present in the novel design disclosed
     here which comprises three materials that circumscribe the tube.
<BR><BR><b>[0129]</b>The type of fuel cell disclosed herein, where stresses are
     symmetric, has significant advantages over the planar cell, where the
     three materials are layered on top of one another to form layered sheets.
     Since these layers are not symmetric, namely, they are not mirrored
     relative to one another, stresses that arise within such a layered
     structure cause the structure to bend every time it is heated and cooled,
     namely, the structure `breathes` in and out every time it is thermally
     cycled. That is, tensile stresses arise on one surface and compressive
     stresses arise on the other surface during thermal cycling. This
     condition is further exacerbated when the metal, bipolar interconnect
     plates are attached to the planar SOFCs and more so when the planar SOFC
     are stacked together as shown in FIG. 4. It is not a surprise that one
     major failure phenomenon observed in the planar SOFC stack is
     delamination. As discussed below, when the novel tubular cells disclosed
     here are stacked together, the stresses are still symmetric and not
     subject to delamination.
<BR><BR><b>[0130]</b>The novel tubes shown in FIGS. 5A, 5B and 5C are made by a variety
     of methods, including the method used to manufacture the described
     Westinghouse SOFC tubes. Namely, in the Westinghouse method, tube
     manufacturing starts by extruding powder to make a thick walled tube of
     the cathode material that is then heated to produce a strong, thick
     walled porous tube. A gas phase reaction is then used to form a thin
     yttria-stabilized ZrO<sub>2</sub> (YSZ), dense layer oxide electrolyte on the
     outer surface of this porous cathode material. A slurry method can then
     be used to coat the outer surface, namely, the dense YSZ surface, with a
     metal powder such as nickel or its oxides and YSZ, that will produce the
     porous anode material after a high temperature treatment. Other tubular
     SOFC designs are also used to fabricate and manufacture the SOFC tubes.
     For example, in the Westinghouse design, the porous cathode material is
     the structurally supporting material. The same tube can be made where the
     porous anode material is the inner, structurally supporting material.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Disclosure of New Stack Designs</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0131]</b>Another novel feature of the stack design disclosed here is the
     arrangement of individual SOFC cells. In this novel arrangement, shown in
     its simplest form in FIG. 5B, the outer porous electrodes 53 are
     connected together along the length of each cylindrical cell as
     illustrated in FIG. 5C. The common connection 56 of the outer, porous
     electrodes to one another allows for commonly shared structural supports
     between the cells as shown in FIG. 6B, and commonly shared electrodes
     such as those shown by number 62 in FIG. 6B and number 85 in FIG. 8B and
     91 in FIG. 9A and 95 in FIG. 9C that can be extended beyond the
     cylindrical cells to be connected to adjacent cells at both ends of the
     stack. On the other hand, each of the inner porous electrodes is isolated
     from one another.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Stack Designs with Tubular Cells</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0132]</b>These designs are discussed herein below.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>The Four Cell</b></font>, Triangular Bundle
<BR><BR><b>[0133]</b>FIGS. 5A, 5B and 5C illustrate one basic bundle of tubular SOFCs
     that is formed with four cells, where three of the four tubes are bonded
     to the center tube at every 120° (FIG. 5A to 5B) to form a
     triangular bundle. The material 56 that bonds the tubes together (FIG.
     5C) may be, but is not limited to, the same porous material that is used
     to produce the outer porous electrode material. Additionally, this
     material need not be porous. The configuration shown in FIG. 5B is the
     simplest of the new SOFC bundles that are stacked together. It is
     composed of four tubes.
<BR><BR><b>[0134]</b>Hollow metal tubes that serve both as an external electrode contact
     and a flow path to introduce the gas (either fuel or air) to the interior
     of the tube are fitted to make contact with the inner, porous electrode
     material. Optionally a metal felt is used as the material that produces a
     snug, nearly gas tight and electrically connected contact with the inner
     surface of each tube. The metal felt has a low elastic modulus and thus
     is sufficiently compliant to minimize stresses that arise due to the
     differential thermal expansion coefficients between the SOFC and the
     inserted tube. In this simple bundle, the outer surface of four cells is
     the other porous electrode; it is continuous and thus a common,
     connective electrode for all four cells. The four tubes are immersed in a
     gas, either air or fuel (opposite to the gas that flows through the
     tubes); this is easily done by placing the four tubes within an enclosure
     where either the fuel or air is introduced. An external metal electrode
     with the cross sectional shape of the four tubes can be affixed to each
     end of the four-tube bundle such that it mates with the external surface
     of the four tubes. A metal felt acts as a compliant layer to both ensure
     a electrical connection and to minimize stresses. The tubes that are fit
     into the inner diameter of each tube and electrically connected to the
     inner porous electrodes are the inner electrodes for each cell. One end
     of the bundle can be one electrode (outer electrode) and the other end of
     the bundle, the inner electrode.
<BR><BR><b>[0135]</b>Thus the arrangement shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B is a bundle of four
     cells; the outer electrode 51 is common to all four, and the inner
     electrode 52 is separate for each of the four cells. The electrolyte 55
     is sandwiched between the anode and cathode electrodes 51 and 52. Since
     the outer electrode is common to all four cells, the four cells can only
     be connected in parallel when a load is connected to the outer electrode
     and the four inner electrodes. How a series connection is formed is
     discussed below.
<BR><BR><b>[0136]</b>When the external electrode is fixed to only one end of the bundled
     cells, it can be either the anode or cathode, and correspondingly the
     internal electrodes become the opposite electrode (cathode or anode,
     respectively) for the bundle. In this way, the four tubes can be
     connected in a parallel arrangement with both electrodes located on one
     end of the bundle.
<BR><BR><b>[0137]</b>It should be noted that as electrical current is generated by the
     stack, the current travels along the length of each tube, both through
     the inner, porous electrode material and through the outer, porous
     electrode material. Since both electrode materials exhibit a resistance
     to the flow of current, the tube will heat up as current is generated.
     Thus, to allow the use of inexpensive metals for the connecting, external
     electrodes and tubes to flow gas into the tubes, the external electrode
     contact should be cooled using either radiation or fluid cooling.
<BR><BR><b>[0138]</b>In conventional SOFC stacks, namely either the conventional
     Siemens-Westinghouse tubular design, or the planar stack design, the
     connections between the individual cells are within the hot zone of the
     stack, thus, preventing the electrodes from being cooled and preventing
     the electrodes from being made of an inexpensive metal with good
     electrical properties.
<BR><BR><b>[0139]</b>FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C show that two sets of spines (61 & 62) are
     introduced into the triangular bundle. One set, shown in FIG. 6A is
     called the internal spine 61, which is used to decrease the resistance of
     the current path from the internal porous electrode material for each
     tube within the bundle. The electrolyte 65 (same as 55 and often YSZ) is
     sandwiched between the electrode 64 and 67. The internal spines 61 are
     dense or porous, monolithic bodies containing a central cylindrical core,
     with a length that exceeds the length of the SOFC tubes, and at least two
     ribs 68 (four are shown) that extend the length of the SOFC tubes. There
     may be an advantage to making the spines porous. If they are porous, gas
     easily transports across the spine, thus ensuring a uniform pressure (or
     concentration) of the active species in the gas--oxygen in the oxidant,
     hydrogen or carbon monoxide or other fuel species in the fuel. This will
     ensure a uniform distribution of the active species over the
     electrode/electrolyte interface--thus ensuring good fuel and oxidant
     utilization, minimization of hot spots, and efficient operation. The
     internal spines are made of the same material used for the internal
     porous electrode or of some other compatible material. If the internal,
     porous electrode and the internal spine materials are identical, both
     will have the same thermal expansion coefficient despite the fact that
     one is porous and one is dense. Thus, residual stresses will not arise if
     both are made of the same material. Alternatively, the spines are made of
     porous materials.
<BR><BR><b>[0140]</b>FIG. 6B shows the external spines 62. Like the internal spines 61,
     the external spine 62 is composed of a cylindrical core, which may be
     porous or dense, that is bonded to the external porous electrode of the
     inner cylindrical cell, and also bonded to the two adjacent cells with a
     rib. Three of these external spines are used for the triangular bundle.
     Like the internal spines 61, the principal role of the external spines is
     to provide a lower resistance path for current. Channel 63 is open for
     passage of gas. A secondary role of the external spines 62 is to provide
     structural support for the triangular bundle. Likewise the same material
     should be used for the dense external spines as used for the porous
     external electrode that surround each of the four cells.
<BR><BR><b>[0141]</b>As discussed above, because the four cells within the triangular
     bundle share a common external electrode, the four cells can only be
     connected together in a parallel arrangement. This arrangement of four
     cells is called a bundle. But, if two or more triangular bundles are
     brought together as shown in FIG. 6C, then, provided that an insulating
     material (66), such as a refractory, electrically insulating felt (66) is
     used to separate the adjacent bundles, a large number of the triangular
     bundles can be placed together (only 6 are shown in FIG. 6C) connected in
     series to one another. The separators do not need to be continuous along
     the length of the cylindrical cells, but simply need to electrically
     isolate one from the other. By stacking the triangular bundles together,
     the external electrode (64) of one triangular bundle is connected to the
     internal electrode of the adjacent triangular bundle, and so on for
     connections along the line of adjacent triangular bundle.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>The Six Cell</b></font>, Hexagonal Bundle
<BR><BR><b>[0142]</b>FIG. 7A shows the hexagonal bundle composed of six cylindrical
     cells, bonded to one another as shown in FIG. 5C. This arrangement of six
     cells is called a bundle. Each cylindrical cell contains one internal
     spine 71, which creates the channel 73 for passage of gas to reduce the
     resistance to current flow. The bundle contains only one external spine
     72, which creates the channel 73 for passage of gas at the center of the
     array 70. It is bonded to the six surrounding cells by ribs. Although the
     principal role of the external spine is to reduce the resistance for
     current flow, it also has a structural role in supporting the surrounding
     six tubular cells. As for the four cells in the triangular bundle, the
     six cells within the hexagonal bundle also share a common external
     electrode 72 and thus, they can only be connected in parallel. FIG. 7B
     shows that a number of hexagonal bundles are placed together to form a
     stack. Because each hexagonal bundle is electrically insulated form one
     another, they can be connected in series to increase the voltage of the
     combined stack. The material 75 that electrically insulates one bundle
     from another can be a refractory felt or simply porous spacers that are
     electrically insulating. The insulating material that separates the
     hexagonal bundles does not need to be bonded to the bundles. It would be
     expected that bonding the insulating material to the individual bundles
     would create problems that would give rise to residual stresses due to
     differential thermal expansion, etc. Also, if bonded, it may react with
     the electrodes and spines, and adversely affect electrical conduction
     properties. It should be noted that although the insulating material
     between the bundles is not bonded to the bundles, it should aid in
     structurally supporting the stack of bundles.
<BR><BR><b>[0143]</b>FIG. 7B also shows that the array of hexagonal bundles of FIG. 7A
     that are contained in an enclosure in which the gas (air or fuel), is
     contained so it is in contact with the external porous electrodes of all
     the cells within the stack.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>The Seven Cell Hexagonal Bundle</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0144]</b>FIG. 8A shows seven cylindrical cells bundled and bonded together.
     Each cylindrical cell contains an internal spine 81 creating channel 83
     for passage of gas for improved electrical conduction. FIG. 8B shows the
     external spines 85 bonded to every two adjacent cells. And FIG. 8C shows
     an array of hexagonal bundles that can be connected together in a series
     arrangement. All are contained within an enclosure 89 that contains one
     of the two gases that contacts the external porous electrodes for each of
     the cylindrical cells.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>The Continuous Hexagonal Bundle</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0145]</b>FIG. 9A to 9D are illustrations of how individual cylindrical cells
     can be connected together in a manner similar to that shown in FIG. 7A,
     but in a way that larger number of cylindrical cells can be continually
     added to one another to form bundles of six cells (FIG. 9A), ten cells
     (FIG. 9B), 14 cells (not shown), 18 cells (FIG. 9c), . . . 6+4n cells
     (n=number of external electrodes protruding the stack), each contained in
     an electrically insulating enclosure with a rectangular cross section.
     Each of these configurations can be called a bundle. Within each bundle,
     the tubular cells are connected in parallel (all external electrodes 91
     connected together, and all internal electrodes 96 connected together)
     outside of the hot box. The gas in contact with the external electrodes
     is contained within the enclosure. The second gas, that in contact with
     the internal electrode, is fed though the center of each cell and is thus
     isolated from the external gas. FIG. 9D shows the stacking of six bundles
     (a case where each bundle has 14 tubular cells), each electrically
     isolated from one another. When the cathodes from one bundle are
     connected to the anodes of an adjacent bundle, the two bundles are
     connected in series. The open area of the space 94 in relation to the
     size and area of the spine has special significance. The area fraction of
     the open portion of the space must be large enough to allow useful
     passage of the gas in relation to the electrons transferred and current
     generated. In other words, if the area fraction of the external spine 91
     within the region between the cells is too large, the passage of gas
     needed to generate current would be too small to produce a practical
     SOFC. Likewise, if the area fraction of the spine within the passage is
     too small, it would not significantly reduce the resistance to current
     flow to the ends of the stack. It is expected that the area fraction of
     the spine within the passage will be between about 0.05 and 0.95,
     preferably between about 0.10 and 0.40 and more preferably between about
     0.20 and 0.25. It is expected that the optimum area fraction 93 of the
     spine also depends on the electrical load and also on the electrical
     conduction properties of the spine. The same type of area fraction exists
     for inner spine located in the space, within each cell. In such a manner,
     all bundles are connected in series to increase the output voltage.

     Electrode Material
<BR><BR><b>[0146]</b>The different stack configurations and the bundles that are stacked
     together all have electrodes (internal and external spines) that extend
     beyond the cylindrical cell as shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B for one
     cylindrical cell. FIGS. 10A and 10B show the external electrode (103)
     extends beyond the cylindrical cell on one end, and the internal
     electrode (101), extending beyond the cylindrical cell at the other end.
     Since the cell generates heat as it generates voltage and current, a
     design with the electrodes extending beyond the cell, out of the hottest
     zone, is very desirable since the ends of both electrodes are cooled
     either by radiation, or cooled gas, or cooled water, when properly
     engineered. As shown in FIG. 10B, when the electrodes extend beyond the
     cell, one on one end, and the other on the other end, one end becomes the
     cathode, and the other becomes the anode. But, not shown in FIGS. 10A &
     10B is a different configuration, where both electrodes extend beyond the
     cylindrical cell at one of the two ends, or at both ends. In such cases,
     the anode and cathode are found at the same end, or both ends of the
     cell. All three electrode configurations can be useful for different
     designs where individual cells are connected together in either a
     parallel or a series arrangement.
<BR><BR><b>[0147]</b>FIG. 10B also shows that the two gases (fuel and air) must be kept
     separate from one another, and that one gas (either fuel or air,
     depending on the composition of the internal and external porous
     electrode materials) must flow through the center of the cylindrical
     cell, whereas the other gas must be in contact with the external, porous
     electrode material. The cell shown in FIG. 10B is within an enclosure
     (not detailed) that contains one of the two gases. Thus, since the second
     gas must be confined to flow through the interior of the cell, flow tubes
     must be fitted to the tube to confine the flow of the gas to the interior
     and keep this gas separated from the other gas on the external portion of
     the cell. The tubes (manifolds) 105 & 106 are shown to fit within the
     tube and sealed in some manner so the seal is more or less, gas tight.
     Although the sealing conditions and materials are not detailed in this
     disclosure, the seal is a chemically bonded seal, e.g., a seal made from
     glass, ceramic, or metal powder that is heated after the flow tube is
     placed within the cell as shown in FIG. 10B, separated by said powder. At
     the desired temperature, the powder (glass, ceramic, metal) either
     sinters or flows to bond the tube to the interior of the cylindrical
     cell. The flow tube itself is made from either an electrically insulating
     ceramic (or glass-ceramic), or from a metal. Metal tubes are used since
     the flow tubes can be cooled as indicated above and discussed in more
     detail below. If the flow tube is made of a conduction metal, it is
     directly connected to the inner spine such that both the spine and the
     flow tube provide a continuous path for the transport of electronic
     current. If the flow tube is made of an insulating material (glass or
     glass-ceramic), then only the spine (shown to protrude beyond the flow
     tube) is the conduit for the passage of electronic current.
<BR><BR><b>[0148]</b>FIGS. 11A, 11B, 11C and 11D show that when more than one tubular
     cell is stacked together, and an external enclosure is used to confine
     the gas that must flow past the porous, external electrode, all of the
     flow tubes, a set of flow tubes used for the gas that must flow through
     the interior of each cell. A set that is used for the gas that flows pass
     the porous, external electrode material, is combined by forming a
     manifold that holds both sets of tubes, yet allows the electrodes to
     extend for connects for within the stack and from one stack to another.
     Since both the anodes and cathodes extend beyond the hot zone, the
     manifolds are made of a metal that is either sufficiently oxidation
     resistant (such as a super alloy or a stainless steel) that does not need
     cooling, other than radiation cooling, or a less oxidation resistant
     metal (an iron alloy) that may need air or water cooling within the
     manifold. In this latter case, the manifold has a double wall for the
     flow of cooling air or cooling water, or has cooling pipes, which are
     welded to the external portion of the manifold to produce the desired
     temperature.
<BR><BR><b>[0149]</b>The manifold shown in FIGS. 11B, 11C and 11D is fitted to the
     exterior enclosure with a reasonably gas tight seal so that the gas
     introduced to be in contact with the porous, external electrode can be
     introduced through one of the two manifolds (one of the two ends of the
     hexagonal stack), made to flow past the external porous electrode, and
     allowed to exit through flow tubes in the opposite manifold (the one at
     the other end of the stack). The flow of the external gas, in contact
     with the porous, external electrode, is shown by dark arrows 111 in FIG.
     11B, 11C and 11D. The second gas, i.e., the gas that is in contact with
     the porous, inner electrode 101 is passed though the flow tubes bonded
     (or sealed) to the interior diameter of each of the tubular cells. This
     second gas is introduced at one end (through the flow tubes that protrude
     from the manifold) and exits the other end (through the flow tubes that
     protrude from the manifold at the other end of the stack).
<BR><BR><b>[0150]</b>FIGS. 12A, 12B, 12C show a nearly identical configuration; however,
     this stack has the six-cell hexagonal configuration. In this design, the
     gas 123 that must be in contact with the porous, external electrode
     material is introduced via the center flow tube. The gas entering this
     tube will not flow though the six cylindrical cells within the stack, but
     will flow around all of the cells, always in contact with the porous,
     external electrode material 122. This gas introduced at one end, will
     exit the other end of the stack, depleted of the reactive component
     (oxygen at the cathode, and hydrogen or hydrogen+carbon monoxide at the
     anode) and enriched in the inert (for example nitrogen) or reacted (for
     example water vapor or water vapor+carbon dioxide) components though the
     central flow tube. The second gas, namely the one in contact with the
     porous, inner electrode material 121, is made to flow though the flow
     tubes that are sealed to each of the cylindrical cells as discussed
     above. Other features of the manifolds would be similar to those
     discussed for the stack shown in FIG. 11D.
<BR><BR><b>[0151]</b>Other stack configurations, such as that shown in FIGS. 6 and 9 will
     have similar manifolds. Also, when cells are combined as bundles to be
     connected in series, each bundle either has its own set of manifolds, or
     the manifold is designed to accommodate all of the different bundles.
<BR><BR><b>[0152]</b>In addition, although not shown in FIGS. 11B, 11C and 11D and 12B
     and 12C, if the flow tube is made of a non-conducting material, the
     electrode rod must be brought through the flow tube to make an electrical
     connection. On the other hand, if the flow tubes are they are simply
     connected to the electrode rods or the spines. In this case, the two
     different types of flow tubes (one used for one gas and one set of
     electrodes, and the other for the other gas and the other set of
     electrodes) must be electrically insulated from one another.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Non Circular Cell Cross</b></font>-Sections
<BR><BR><b>[0153]</b>FIG. 13 shows that the cells need not be circular; there they are
     shown to be elliptical (131). The elliptical shape is advantageous
     because it increases the surface area of the electrolyte per unit volume,
     and thus, the stack, composed of the same number of cells as for the
     design with the circular cross section, produces more energy per unit
     volume, as it is more compact.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Triangular Cells Without a Common External Electrode</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0154]</b>Another embodiment of a triangular solid oxide fuel cell includes a
     configuration of bundles of cells that do not share a common electrode.
     This is different from the stack described above, where all cells within
     a bundle share a common, exterior electrode, this embodiment is composed
     of triangular channels where each triangular channel contains either the
     cathode spine or the anode spine. FIGS. 14A to 14D describe the sequence
     in which this type of stack is fabricated. The first of these figures,
     FIG. 14A, shows that the electrode material 220 is extruded through a die
     that forms multiple triangular channels as one integral unit. The outer
     geometry has a square cross section as shown. The structure shown in this
     FIG. 14B contains 16 (four within each smaller square) triangular
     channels. Structures with more triangular channels can also be used in
     this example. The electrolyte material 220, 202 or 203 are used to form
     this structure. Extrusion is a common method for forming such an integral
     unit. The general method starts with mixing the electrolyte power with a
     polymer that will enable extrusion through a die opening to form the
     desired structure, for example, that shown in FIG. 14A. Many more
     triangular channels can be extruded at one time. The size of the
     triangular units is only limited by the extrusion technology. Each can
     range in size between about one-half a millimeter and 50 millimeters,
     measured along the hypotenuse of the triangle. The length of the tubular
     structure composed of the triangular channels can be as small as the
     channel size or about 50 to 100 times the channel size. Smaller channel
     dimensions produce a higher power-density fuel cell. Note that extrusion
     is the forming method to make ceramic substrate structures for catalytic
     converters found in all automobiles.
<BR><BR><b>[0155]</b>After the structure is extruded, it is heated in a furnace to first
     burn off, or decompose, the polymer used to produce a plastic power
     mixture that enables the extrusion. This decomposition takes place at
     lower temperatures (between about 100° C. and 1000° C.,
     preferably between 150 and 900° C.); the heating rate in this
     temperature range is very low, for example 1° C./minute, to avoid
     disruption during polymer decomposition, which produces gases, which is
     well known for this processing method. After the polymer is decomposed,
     the temperature is then increased to densify the electrolyte. For
     example, if the electrolyte material is yttrium stabilized zirconium
     oxide, then the temperature is raised to 1200° C. to 1600°
     C., preferably between 1300 and 1500° C., depending of the power
     characteristics, which are well known to those of skill in the art.
     Densification produces shrinkage, thus the dimensions of the dense
     electrolyte structure is smaller than is shown in FIG. 14B. In the next
     step shown in FIG. 14C, the inside surfaces of the triangular channels
     206 and 221 are coated with the anode material 223 and cathode 224
     materials; different coating methods are used, including slurry coating.
     Anode spines 225 and cathode spines 226 that are previously separately
     extruded are now inserted into their respective triangular channels as
     shown in FIG. 14D. Namely, the surfaces coated with the anode material
     223 and the anode spine 225 are made to contact one another to provide
     the flow of an electrical current after the stack is heated again to bond
     the coating and spines together. Likewise, the surfaces coated with the
     cathode material 224 and the cathode spine 226 are made to contact one
     another and bonded together during a heat treatment. During heating, the
     spines are bonded to their respective coatings, and the two types of
     coats are partially densified to increase strength, yet produce the
     required porous electrode materials. These spines are designed to have a
     cylindrical core 227 and 228 with three vanes that extend into the
     corners of the triangular channels as shown in FIG. 14D. They are also
     designed such that the cylindrical cores, but not the vanes, extend
     beyond the triangular channels so that the cells can be connected
     together outside of the hot zone (as is described herein above).
<BR><BR><b>[0156]</b>FIG. 14 is also described as the fabrication of SOFC with anode 225
     and cathode spines 226 using an extrusion method to form the
     multi-channel fuel cell structure 229. FIG. 14A is a cross section of an
     extruded power-polymer mixture forming the electrolyte structure of a
     multi-channeled structure subdivided into triangular channels 222 (FIG.
     14B) same square tube shown in (FIG. 14A) after heating at high
     temperatures to produce a dense structure on which the two electrode
     materials 233 and 234 are deposited, as powders, in the adjacent
     triangular channels 223 as shown in (FIG. 14C). Any two adjacent
     triangular channels, separated by the electrolyte material 220 form one
     solid oxide fuel cell. Each triangular channel is part of three solid
     oxide fuel cells, namely, its surrounded by three other triangular
     channels that contain the opposite electrode. As shown in FIG. 14D the
     anode spine 225 and cathode spine 226 materials, composed as cylinders
     with three vanes, are inserted into each triangular channel to make
     contact with the electrode materials within the respective channel. At
     this point, all materials are heated to bond the spines to their
     respective electrodes within the channels and to produce the desired,
     strength and porosity for the electrode materials.
<BR><BR><b>[0157]</b>As shown in FIG. 14B and 14D, any one triangular channel 206 or 221
     is either the cathode part of a cell (as 230) or anode part of a cell
     236. The electrolyte 235 separates triangular cathode channels 233 from
     triangular anode channels 234. FIG. 14D also shows that a solid oxide
     fuel cell is defined as either one triangular cathode channel adjacent to
     three triangular anode channels, or one triangular anode channel adjacent
     to three triangular cathode channels. Because the triangular channels do
     not share a common electrode, the cells are electrically connected either
     in parallel or series.
<BR><BR><b>[0158]</b>FIG. 20 is a schematic cross sectional representation of a silver
     wire 292 embedded in a ceramic spine 293. The silver is used for its
     increased electrical conductivity and this spine is interchangeable with
     any of the spines described herein.
<BR><BR><b>[0159]</b>The following examples are provided for explanation and description
     only. They are not to be construed to be limits in anyway or factual.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>EXAMPLES</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0160]</b>All materials for the individual fuel cells are conventional,
     namely, they are same as being currently used as the state of the art.
     Improved materials can be incorporated into the design, but they are not
     required for the novel design. The uniqueness of the disclosure lies in
     the stack design, not the materials.
<BR><BR><b>[0161]</b>Although the individual cells and their stack produce symmetric
     stresses that are not expected to produce bending strains under uniform
     temperature conditions, the choice of specific composition for each
     material should be made in an attempt to best reduce any thermal
     expansion mismatch.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Components and Manufacturing</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0162]</b>All components, namely solid oxide fuel cell with any cross
     sectional shape, dense or porous spines, etc. may be manufactured as
     separate components by companies under contract, university laboratories
     and the like. These components are then assembled to produce the stack
     design configurations described above. Bonding the components together is
     accomplished with conducting ceramic cements with nearly the same
     composition as the components. The bonding is usually accomplished with a
     heat treatment.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Example </b></font>1 (Part 1)
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Fabrication of SOFC Design</b></font>
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>A Complete Bundle of Either Six or Seven Cells</b></font>
<BR><BR><b>[0163]</b>(a) Rationale: The fuel cell architecture is designed for minimizing
     voltage losses and thus for enhancing performance. For a given set of
     materials, this requires a careful control over microstructures of the
     electrodes (particle size, pore size, volume fraction porosity, and
     particle/particle contact morphology), the thickness of the electrodes,
     and the electrolyte thickness. A typical, high performance cell usually
     has at least five distinct layers (may be more). The schematic in FIG. 15
     shows the various layers and the typical thicknesses for an
     anode-supported cell.
<BR><BR><b>[0164]</b>The fabrication procedure involves at least two steps, and possibly
     more. It is important that electrolyte, cathode interlayer and
     anode-interlayer thicknesses are on the order of a few microns or a few
     tens of microns. Also, microstructures in the interlayers must be very
     fine. The typical particle sizes in the interlayers are in fractions of a
     micron to a few microns.
<BR><BR><b>[0165]</b>Tubular geometry--Hexagonal structure: It is not generally easy to
     extrude a hexagonal structure with all of the layers maintained to
     precise tolerances, especially when one or more layers are only a few
     microns thick. One approach for fabricating the desired structure in a
     cost-effective manner is as follows.
<BR><BR><b>[0166]</b>The above structure (cross-section) is shown in a tubular geometry
     in the schematic of FIG. 16.
<BR><BR><b>[0167]</b>In order to produce the above structure without the cathode current
     collector, the following steps are followed:   <b>[0168]</b>Extrude the
     anode-support tube (141). <b>[0169]</b>Apply a thin anode interlayer (142)
     (which is done by dip-coating or spray coating). <b>[0170]</b>Apply a thin
     electrolye layer (143) (which is done by dip-coating or spray-coating)
     <b>[0171]</b>Apply a thin cathode interlayer (144) (which is done by dip-coating
     or spray coating).
<BR><BR><b>[0172]</b>This process leads to the fabrication of the cell with first four
     layers, excluding the current collector layer. A schematic of the
     structure is shown in FIG. 15.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Example </b></font>1 (Part II)
<BR><BR><b>[0173]</b>Fabrication of the Hexagonal Structure Using Cathode Current
     Collector Material: (The fabrication is done conveniently by extrusion. A
     schematic is shown in FIG. 16.)
<BR><BR><b>[0174]</b>The extruded part (hexagonal structure) is such that circular
     openings are slightly larger than the outer dimensions of the anode
     support tube with three layers deposited on it. The anode-support tubes
     with three layers deposited on them then can be inserted into the
     structure shown in FIG. 18 or in FIG. 19. The particle sizes, porosities
     and sintering characteristics are so adjusted (through appropriate
     sintering optimization studies) that when sintered, excellent bonding
     occurs across all interfaces. The electrolyte should be fully dense (no
     connected porosity), while all other components should be porous with
     requisite microstructures. A schematic of the final part (a bundle)
     comprising all components is shown in FIG. 19.
<BR><BR><b>[0175]</b>(b) Similarly, when Example 1, Part I and II are repeated wherein
     the extruded anode support tube wall thickness is between 0.25 and 2.0
     mm, the thin anode interlayer is between 1 micron and 100 microns, the
     thin electrolyte layer is between 1 micron and 100 microns, and the thin
     cathode layer is between 1 micron and 100 microns.
<BR><BR><b>[0176]</b>(c) Similarly, in Example I, Part I and II, (b) the internal spine
     has an area fraction relative to the area within the tubular cell that is
     between about 0.05 and 0.95.
<BR><BR><b>[0177]</b>(d) Similarly, in Example I, Part I and II (b), the external spine
     has an area fraction relative to the area external to the tubular cell
     that is between about 0.05 and 0.95.
<br><br><font size="+1"><b>EXAMPLE </b></font>2
<BR><BR><b>[0178]</b>Fabrication of Triangular Cell Structure by Extrusion:
<BR><BR><b>[0179]</b>Triangular cell structure of the design shown in FIG. 14A-14D is
     fabricated by extrusion. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powder
     containing 8 mol.% Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and 92% ZrO2  of a fine particle size
     (approximately between 0.1 and 2 microns, from a commercial vendor, e.g.,
     Tosoh, 1-7-7 Akasaka, Minato-ku, Tokyo 107 Japan) is used. YSZ powder is
     mixed with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and stearic acid
     (CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>16</sub>COOH), from a commercial vendor such as Alfa
     Aesar, 26 Parkridge Road, Ward Hill, Mass. 01835-6904. The proportions
     are: YSZ: 80 wt. %, EVA: 10%, and stearic acid: 10%. A tool-steel or
     tungsten carbide die are designed and fabricated. The die has two
     sections. On the entry side, there are cylindrical holes placed in a
     regular arrangement. The diameter of the holes depend upon the flow
     characteristics of the YSZ+polymer mixture to be used, and the desired
     dimensions of the final cell structure. The diameter is anticipated to be
     between 0.1 mm and 10 mm. The length of the cell is between 5 mm and 100
     mm. The length of the cylindrical holes is less than the length of the
     die. From the other side of the die, thin slots corresponding to rib
     structure given in FIG. 14A are machined. The width of the slots is in
     the range 0.05 mm to 0.5 mm. The length of the slots is between 2 mm and
     30 mm. These slots meet the cylindrical holes somewhere in the middle of
     the die. The length of the slotted section is between about 5 mm and 50
     mm. The total length of the die comprises the length of the cylindrical
     holes and the length of the slotted regions. The die is suitably
     positioned in an extrusion device.
<BR><BR><b>[0180]</b>The YSZ+polymer mixture is introduced into the cavity, and pressure
     is applied via a plunger. The YSZ+polymer mixture enters the side of the
     die with cylindrical holes, and exits from the side with slots resulting
     in structure shown in FIG. 14A.
<BR><BR><b>[0181]</b>The next step involves heating the extruded structure in a furnace.
     Initially, it is heated slowly, at a rate of about 1 degree/min to about
     600 or 700° C. to burn out all organic matter without deforming
     and/or cracking the structure. Then the temperature is raised to about
     1400° C. The heating rate for the latter step is much higher; and
     is anticipated to be about 10 degrees per minute. The temperature is
     maintained at 1400° C. for 1 hour. The furnace is cooled to room
     temperature. This procedure leads to the formation of the structure shown
     in FIG. 14B, which is next hardened (no polymer), and is nearly fully
     dense. Decrease in porosity leads to the occurrence of shrinkage. For
     this reason, the dimensions of the structure in FIG. 14B are smaller than
     in FIG. 14A.
<BR><BR><b>[0182]</b>Cathode spines are made of La<sub>0</sub>.Sr<sub>0</sub>.2MnO<sub>3</sub> (LSM),
     obtained from a commercial vendor such as Praxair Specialty Ceramics;
     16130 Wood-Red Road #7, Woodinville, Wash. 98072. LSM powder of about 0.1
     to 2 micron size is mixed with EVA and stearic acid in the same
     proportions as for the YSZ electrolyte. A tool steel or tungsten carbide
     die is designed with die cavity which upon extruding the LSM+polymer
     mixture will yield the spine structure, is designed and made. The mixture
     extruded to form the spines. The spines are then heated in a furnace
     slowly (˜1 degree/min.) to about 600 or 700° C. to remove
     organic matter without deformation and/or cracking. Subsequently, the
     temperature is raised to 1250° C. at a rate of about 10
     degrees/min, and maintained at temperature for 1 hour. The furnace is
     next cooled to room temperature. This procedure leads to the fabrication
     of cathode spines. The die size is designed such that the fabricated
     spines can slide into the triangular cavities of FIG. 14B with very small
     clearance such that spines touch the YSZ structure.
<BR><BR><b>[0183]</b>Similar procedures are then used for fabricating anode spines. A
     mixture of NiO and YSZ, each of 0.1 to 2 micron particle size, are made
     containing 70 weight % NiO and 30 weight % YSZ. NiO+YSZ+polymer mixture
     are extruded to form anode spines. The spines are heated in a furnace
     slowly (1 degree/min) to about 600 or 700° C. to remove organics
     without deformation and/or cracking. Then the temperature is raised to
     1400° C. (10 degrees/min). The temperature is maintained for 1
     hour, and the furnace is cooled to room temperature. This leads to the
     fabrication of the anode spines. The dimensions of the extrusion dies are
     so designed that the spines just slide into the triangular cavities of
     FIG. 19B.
<BR><BR><b>[0184]</b>Cathode and Anode: A mixture of LSM and YSZ is made such that each
     component is in equal weight proportions. This slurry is made in a
     suitable liquid, such as ethanol. Alternate triangular cavities of the
     structure shown in FIG. 14B are coated with the slurry. The layer
     thickness is between about 20 microns and 200 microns. A mixture of NiO
     and YSZ is made with each component in equal proportions. Slurry of the
     same composition is made using a suitable liquid such as ethanol. The
     remaining triangular cavities are coated with this slurry. The typical
     thickness is between about 20 and 200 microns. FIG. 14C shows the
     schematic after these steps.
<BR><BR><b>[0185]</b>The cathode spines are inserted into the triangular cavities coated
     with LSM+YSZ. Anode spines are introduced into the triangular cavities
     coated with NiO+YSZ. The structure is heated to a temperature between
     1100 and 1250° C. for one hour to form adherent and strong cathode
     and anodes, which are still porous. FIG. 14D shows the final schematic.
     The NiO is next reduced to Ni during the first heat up once a reducing
     gas is introduced into the anode cavities. For the example just
     described, the anode spines are be porous since they contain initially
     NiO, which is reduced to Ni forming porosity. Alternate possibilities for
     fabrication of the anode spines exist.
<BR><BR><b>[0186]</b>While only a few embodiments of the invention have been shown and
     described herein, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that various
     modifications and changes can be made in the design and materials to
     produce improved fuel cells, and the production of power and/or heat
     thereof without departing from the spirit and scope of the present
     invention. All such modifications and changes are intended to be carried
     out thereby.
