	<p class="headline_meta">	<strong><span class="author vcard fn">Bryan Rich</span></strong> | <em title="2011-04-30">Saturday, April 30, 2011 at 7:30 am</em>	</p>				</div>

<p>
<img src="http://images.moneyandmarkets.com/2071/bryan-rich.jpg" border="0" alt="Bryan Rich" style="border:5px solid #dddddd; margin:0px 20px 10px 0px; float:left;" />Much has been made of the persistent slide in the dollar in recent months. Many proclaim it&#8217;s the end of its status as the primary world reserve currency. Others suggest it&#8217;s a notice of the demise of America. These viewpoints tend to quickly spread to Main Street, and that has a tendency to create panic.</p>
<p>How bad is it?</p>
<p>For some broader perspective, the Dollar Index (the dollar against a basket of major currencies) still sits 3.5 percent above the lows of 2008. Measured against over 75 currencies in the world, the dollar is weaker against 26, flat against 11 and stronger against 38 since the onset of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>And it still commands 62 percent of global currency reserves &mdash; down only three percentage points from pre-crisis levels.</p>
<p>So, while it&#8217;s made new all-time lows against some currencies, it&#8217;s not a bloodletting like the media would have you believe. In fact, from a fundamental and technical perspective, it&#8217;s so stretched it has all of the makings of a market that&#8217;s going to snap-back violently.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the drama surrounding the panic scenarios prompted journalists this week to prod a response out of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.</p>
<p>Geithner made an unusually defensive comment about the dollar saying, as long as he&#8217;s around the U.S. has a strong-dollar policy.</p>
<p>Bernanke maintained his rare but consistent comments on the dollar, saying a strong and stable dollar was important for the U.S. and the global economy and that the Fed&#8217;s policy efforts were consistent with achieving a strong dollar.</p>
<p>So if policymakers favor a stronger dollar, why aren&#8217;t they showing concern about its slide?</p>
<p>Some would suggest they just don&#8217;t get it. Others insist there is a covert operation underway by U.S. officials to broadly and desperately devalue the dollar.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my take &#8230;</p>
<p>First, while some near-term weakness can be favorable for the U.S. economy, a more protracted decline in the dollar at the recent pace would mean very negative implications for both the U.S. and the rest of the world &mdash; no one wins. So a weak dollar conspiracy is not the answer.</p>
<p>Clearly U.S. policymakers like a weaker dollar in the near term. It helps stimulate exports and the growth of manufacturing, a historically important ingredient for recovering from economic recession and especially important in the effort of rebalancing the U.S. economy. </p>
<p>In fact, exports have become a big driver of economic growth throughout the &#8220;recovery&#8221; phase. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reports that exports have made the biggest 18-month contribution to U.S. GDP growth on record.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s the Good. </strong><br />
 <strong>How about the Bad?</strong></p>
<p>In addition to a supply shock associated with problems in the Middle East and commodity hoarding from China, a weaker dollar is adding to rising commodity prices.</p>
<p>The biggest threat of a weaker dollar though, if perceived as open-ended, is capital flight, which can set off a dangerous threat to the country&#8217;s solvency. Despite the many fears, that isn&#8217;t happening.</p>
<p>The truth is, growth in the U.S., even if it doesn&#8217;t hit the optimistic projections this year, continues to be among the top for major developed economies. Meanwhile, inflation (even headline inflation) and market interest rates remain low, and more stable than their counterparts &mdash; all solid underpinnings for the relative value of a currency in this environment.</p>
<p>So given the problems around the world and the reality that the world is in a slow, bumpy recovery, the slide in the dollar in recent months is consistent with just another ebb and flow within the currency markets.</p>
<p>To sum up: While there are significant risks, the facts argue that the weaker dollar isn&#8217;t a sign of a U.S. economic catastrophe. To the contrary, on a relative basis, the U.S. economy is still plugging along.</p>
<p><strong>But Who Is That Hurting?</strong></p>
<p>China.</p>
<p>China has been trying, unsuccessfully, to get a grip on inflation. And rising global asset prices, inflamed by a weaker dollar, puts pressure on China to finally look to its currency policy as a tool to curtail inflation. As such, we may soon see a dollar devaluation that the entire world would embrace: Against the Chinese yuan!</p>

<p>After six years of consistent, but weak, global prodding of the Chinese to appreciate their currency, diplomacy hasn&#8217;t worked. The Chinese have allowed their currency to appreciate a measly 3.6 percent against the dollar on average per year since de-pegging in 2005. Meanwhile their economy has grown by nearly 250 percent in the same time frame. </p>
<p>Clearly, the Chinese have maintained a massive unfair advantage in global trade via their weak currency policy. And the world has always had two options in dealing with it: </p>
<ol>
<li>Convince them to adjust for the greater good of the global economy, or
</li>
<li>Export inflation to China to forcibly adjust up the cost of Chinese exports by driving up wages and input prices.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now it appears that we&#8217;re seeing option number two play out. And China&#8217;s fight to gain control over inflation, isn&#8217;t going well. Perhaps soon, China will finally act to strengthen their currency in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>That would go a long way toward putting the global economy on a path of sustainable recovery, and correcting the continued booms and busts taking place in global economies and financial markets.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bryan</p>

<p>It seems to me, after reading and watching the markets for many years, the current batch of politicians at any period, do not know how to address the problem nor do they appear to want to address the problems on their watch&#8230;They try patching and treating the patient with a mild dose of mediciene and hope the next bunch of jokers will do what they knew needed to be done, did not want to take the blame if they failed&#8211;but they are already failing.  A personal business can not be operated on the political approach and stay in business.  So, as long as we have politicians that are mainly interested in getting eleted, feathering their nest, nothing will change.  The individual business person has to make decisions that best fit his situation and hope for the best.<br />

<p>Only trouble is Brian they are not only exporting inflation to China but to every foreign nation &#8211; in fact the U.S. is exporting their entire debt problem to every pre-crisis, fiscally responsible country that has acted to increase interests rates to maintain it&#8217;s Inflation target. </p>
<p>The Feds and ECB actions have created a arbitrage opportunity between responsible free market nations and these irresponsible chameleons that is crippling traditionally Export reliant nations. Where else is the money flowing into Australia and NZ coming from if not from the Feds money printing?</p>

<p>We all know that the slide in the dollar could be turned around overnight if the fed increased interest rates. I could probably insure this to happen by simply shorting the dollar myself. Because if I did the fed wolud raise rates tomorrow.</p>

<p>George Soros has clearly stated he is bent on breaking the dollar (Bretton Woods).  Others globally, I&#8217;ve read, are already trading &#8211;even oil&#8211; without the US Dollar.  The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and now S. Africa) have called for the US Dollar to be taken off as the world reserve currency. And the IMF has stated that another currency type is being considered for the WRC.  </p>
<p>When that happens, the demand for dollars would drop dramatically. Wouldn&#8217;t that incident alone devalue the dollar exponentially?</p>
<p>In light of all that, I&#8217;m trying to figure out how that meshes with the calmness toward the dollar in your article.  I trade in the currency market as well, and I see the dollar losing ground straight across the board.  The dollar makes mini-rebounds, but never to previously-held levels, at least that I&#8217;ve seen. </p>
<p>And if what you say is true, that the dollar could snap back violently, wouldn&#8217;t that mean a snap reversal for commodities as well (meaning gold, silver, oil, etc. would all plummet)? </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to sound harsh, but the article gave me comfort&#8211;kind of like the string ensemble playing as the Titanic is sinking.</p>

<p>Hello, I am a critic as well but not an expert. My thought is that when China finishes trading most if not all of our T-bills for commodities then they will not have anything to lose by a stronger yuan. Until they unload their assets denominated in US Dollars they would be crazy to take a loss on our debt by appreciating their currency. As far as I can tell this is all about China and the US trading economical places so our international conglomerates can now sell to China things built with cheap non-union labor here in the US and paid for with a non-reserve near worthless currency. Great for corporate profits but terrible for the US standard of living. At least I can see this transfer of wealth coming, unlike the housing/financial swindle.</p>

<p>You are right on, Brian has a penchant for defending the dollar no matter what OBVIOUS political and economic currents are flashing red flags. His call on the dollar is reminiscent of someone who believes that any fiat currency backed up by the faith in that government is all that is needed to guarantee that currency&#8217;s value. Does he remember Argentina, Zimbabwe ? It is folly to assume any government will do the right thing to TRULY RESTORE SANITY to the current world financial crisis.</p>

<p>I am with Jimmie and Lin O. The article is well reasoned, IF we had another more free enterprise oriented government in position. However,  my own experiences of current real life, including trading, tells me otherwise. My perception of what the Fed is doing, connected to what the eventual impact  of the current administration&#8217;s socialist policies will do to the country, makes me want to flee to the life boats of the Titanic.</p>

<p>You should read Martin&#8217;s &#8216;American Apocalypse&#8217;.  There is not just  Gloom &amp; Doom out there as the USS Titanic has already struck the iceberg and is sinking fast.  Yes, the Titanic has been found, but it was + 8,000 feet under water and that is where the US econmoy is headed!!</p>
<p>What will we do next…? The new thing in America: We&#8217;re going to live at the expense of our neighbors. For the first time in modern history, the government is paying out more money, in cash, to citizens, than it is taking in taxes. We spent $2.3 trillion on direct benefits to taxpayers last year, while the government&#8217;s total income was only $2.2 trillion. Roughly 60% of all Americans now receive some significant financial benefit from the government. Meanwhile, less than 50% of all people pay any federal income taxes. And roughly 10% of all taxpayers foot virtually all the significant income taxes levied.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Debt Monster from the Id&#8217; is alive and has the endless energy of the creation of fiat to feed it until the inevitable explosion.  See Forbidden Plant (1950) for the explosive ending to the Debt Monster.  The only difference is that we are not  far enough away to escape the explosion!!.</p>

<p>I believe reality lies somewhere between Bryan&#8217;s view and that of the doomsayers. That is because so much of the Dollar&#8217;s fate relies on policy decisions. I agree with Bryan that officials are not plotting the Dollar&#8217;s demise. But I additionally believe that you currently walk a fine line during any embracement of subtle weak Dollar policy, given the current set of unprecedented global economic circumstances. In watching their currency fall precipitously, policy makers risk waiting too long to embrace the strong Dollar policy that they profess. Getting it right may be the most important task of our time.</p>

<p>I agree with Mike and Richard, Bryan, you write very well thought out, rational articles.  Based on my fundamental, technical and cyclical fact based analysis of the world and US economy, I believe that the US (and possibly a good chunk of world) economy is mirroring the Great Depression or the Japanese economy OR a hybrid of the two. IF this is the case, then, I expect to see the stock &amp; commodity markets correct, similar to 2008 as we come off this bear market &#8220;bull rally&#8221; from March 09. And, guess where I believe this capital will flow, just like in 2008, thats right, US Treasuries and US Cash. Why? because this is the &#8220;perceived flight to safety trade&#8221;. Why? because this is EXACTLY what happened during the Great Depression. Scientist and Financier Alfred Lee Loomis and his Brother-in-law Landon Thorne sold their equities in 1929 and invested in Long Term US Treasuries and did extremely well as the Bond Market returned an average of 6.03% during the 1930&#8242;s. You could also have done well with Gold (ie. Homestake Mining Going Up). IF we are mirroring the Japanese Market, you know that the Nikkei is down over 75% over 22 years. But, guess what, not if you invested in JGBs over this timeframe. And the story gets even better, by having the equity markets and commodity markets (ex. Gold and maybe Silver etc) get sacrificed either implicitly or explicitly, this will bring down the cost of food/energy and all great for the poor and middle class america and world. Also, it gets better, by having capital flow into the US Treasuries, this will keep interest rates low, also great for residential/commercial real estate and for businesses. Also, better even yet, it takes the pressure off of the Fed to raise interest rates and issue big QE3or 4 or 5&#8230;allowing time for the government to get right sized AND allow the private sector to grow us out of this &#8220;Great Recession&#8221; You see Martin, the EU and the EURO are problems right now. Also, Japan is now even worse off with the natural disaster, China has a big bubble in residential/commercial real estate and of course we have the Middle East crisis. So, guess where the intermediate and long term place to invest will be? You got it, the USA, as we will be the first to recover. Remember, the bond market is  2-3x the size of the stock market, so a bond market crash would put the whole world into a depression within weeks, so I don&#8217;t see this happening and I dont think the Lord will want this either. To prove my point with FACTS, every time over the last several years the down plunges by over 150 points, the US Treasuries do the best. I  see this time and time and time again. And if we get a big correction,(deflation trade) like we did in 2008, this is EXACTLY what I see will happen. This is the best way out of this great recession. Thus, as I have said for 18 months now and counting, we will NOT have a bond market crash. However, I would strongly use caution to invest in City/Muni/County/State/Sovereign Bonds of other countries as they are going thru austerity right now and either dont have a printing press AND/Or are not the world&#8217;s reserve currency.</p>

<p>Excellent article. Excellent comments in rebuttal. As a small business man I have never been more confused. My exposure to the street tells me that the stock market gains of the past year are as phony as the digital dollar chips being created.</p>
<p>With so much government manipulation and misinformation, how can anyone have a grip on the next 6 months? I am terrified to invest in a delusion, equally terrified to sit by and watch my money shrink. My business will not be hiring.</p>
<p>We are living in a house of cards, all of us now forced to be gamblers. Hard work will not do it in the new age. It&#8217;s going to take luck.</p>
<p>Whatever relationship you wish to draw between the dollar and the economy, inflation kills. Governments suffocate, stagnate and mutate (once) free markets.</p>

<p>Bryan,</p>
<p>I read reports like this in order to determine what your organization are planning, and then I make my bets against you in regards to silver/gold.  You may be right about the dollar, short-term.  If the dollar snaps back, I&#8217;ll be waiting on the sidelines for the day when silver may reach its 200-DMA, and I continue buying what I can afford.  I&#8217;m siding with H Bez and Jimmie on this one.  Open your eyes in regards to housing, unemployment on the PUBLIC side (not just the private side &#8211; think city and county employees being laid off), and the context of a 40-year fiat experiment gone wrong (again.  Read up on history of paper money in China, France, the American Revolution, the Civil War, and now the Federal Reserve System).</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>&#8230; &#8220;the slide in the dollar in recent months is consistent with just another ebb and flow within the currency markets&#8221; &#8230; Brian, in &#8220;normal&#8221; fiat currency conditions, you&#8217;d probably be spot on, yet there is no acknowledgement that your last call for a dollar rebound was dead wrong. What I want to read from you is: 1) that you were wrong; 2) why you were wrong; 3) and why you&#8217;re right this time. Until there is some reconciliation with your previous bad call, you may be leading your readers (and yourself) into a state of cognitive dissonance. The technical indicators were wrong then, so what makes them correct now?</p>
<p>How is it possible to talk about the value of the dollar without mentioning the looming sovereign debt crisis &#8230; or is that just something that the kooky fringe talk about (Dr. Weiss and Claus Vogt being among them)? Do you make the connection between the revaluing of the Yuan and the repatriation of inflation back to our shores? Can you reconcile your comments with the books listed below? Until then, I remain skeptical, as should anyone else with a rational thought in their head.</p>

<p>David markets do not go straight from point A to point B . . . they retrace, consolidate.  The Dollar, the Euro &amp; the commodities have all had a major run over the last Year.  they are stretched . . . the further they continue to go now the more powerful the snapback will be.  This is all time tested market wisdom that cooler heads use to guide their  view of the marketplace.  Everything is on the verge of a complete reversal Commodities first then Equities.  Yes LinO that IS what it means and did you not read regarding the dollar.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it still commands 62 percent of global currency reserves — down only three percentage points from pre-crisis levels.&#8221;  we are a long way away from all the fears that blowing about these days.  While I don&#8217;t deny them I just think we are about to have a mini 2008 first.  then we will see what the next leg looks like</p>
<p>Dennis McCormack you are dead wrong as this article is laden with investment value!  As many have said in recent months when looking at various forms of investments from Equities to Commodities the line is &#8220;It&#8217;s all about the Dollar, Folks&#8221;  Meaning that the dollar is largely determining the overall trend of equities and commodities and that is exactly what this article is about . . . In fact, Mr Rich tells you the canary to watch for when the Dollar will bottom . . . China . . .</p>
<p>Perhaps line should be  &#8220;It&#8217;s all about the China, Folks&#8221;</p>

<p>I appreciate the viewpoints presented by the author but, without discounting his good points, his conclusion, I think, is largely influenced by the idea regarding the collapse of the dollar that, as he put it, &#8220;nobody wins&#8221;. That would make sense if nobody truly won. If somebody does stand to win, however, it is important to consider that we are not being told who is behind this global collapse. Who wins when both sides lose? The banks that fund both sides would be a great place to begin looking. The &#8220;secret&#8221; societies that put have the power to assert their people to the head of both the democrat and republican parties who run &#8220;against&#8221; each other is another good place to look. To assume that we are told of all parties involved would be naive. This is not a basketball game where the players are all identified by their red and blue shirts, this is a game of propaganda and deception on a push for world domination and we know the tyranny the bible speaks of and the coming from a ONE WORLD LEADER, the antichrist. When everybody loses, the devil wins. He has a small group of followers who believe he will share the pie with them and they&#8217;re willing to sell out the nations of the world for their slice of the devil&#8217;s pie. Obama and Bush are the same in this regard.</p>

<p>Your article is well written and helps the &#8220;optimist&#8221; in me. Unfortunately, the optimism is short-lived, as there are undisputable fundamental risk factors. Comparison with other countries, being in even worse shape, is not convincing. Many of us will benefit from  continuation of this debate.

<p>I agree with the critics of this article. These are not normal times, and economic crises of this depth, which brew for decades, are not resolved in the context of economics alone. Bryan Rich does have something of a pedantic attachment to the dollar. Every column he writes has exactly the same message. And, as others here have pointed out, this has no investment value, and ignores the extraordinary situation we&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>So how can we assess the US government&#8217;s policies and intentions regarding the dollar? I think they&#8217;re exactly the same as they&#8217;ve been since the 1970s: deficit spending to keep the economy ticking over in the face of underlying problems of profitability. Deficit spending appears to generate growth, but it is really the result of the purchase of goods and services with borrowed money. That borrowed money is capital, which, rather than being invested profitably, is actually redircted to mopping up already produced goods and services and thus keeping already existing productoin streams &#8220;profitable&#8221;. Mainstream economists such as Paul Krugman have trouble understanding that state spending &#8211; like excessive consumer spending based on mortgage loans and other forms of credit &#8211; do not equal growth but rather destruction of capital. The irony of all this is that the explosive growth of the past couple of decades has been a sign not of real growth but of economic decay. Take away the credit cards and the economy screaches to a halt. That&#8217;s why the Chinese are sweating: they&#8217;ve realized that the trade surpluses theyve accumulated may amount to a hill of worthless dollars, that, in fact, they have more or less given away many of their goods to the US for free. The US craving for inflation is also behind the US pushing the Chinese to devalue their currency. A weaker dollar means less US debt, and less Chinese profit on &#8220;sales&#8221; of goods already completed. </p>
<p>For individual capitalists, of course, this can seem like a good deal, as some of them can jack up their prices and thus protect their profitability. But such profitability does not represent expansion of the econom as a whole, but just a transfer of existing value from one person to another. Inflation is also a good deal for the finance capitalists who have access to the money the Fed prints. This parasitical money flows everywhere in the world except into profitable investment, seeking quick returns on paper investments and creating the bubbles we&#8217;ve become all too familiar with.  </p>
<p>Not only is inflation &#8211; and the destruction of money that it represents &#8211; not an aberration, it&#8217;s been the norm for the past half  a century and led to the financialization of the West&#8217;s economies, which are too dependent for &#8220;profits&#8221; based on paper asset trading and interest returns on the purchase of consumer debt. </p>
<p>Inflation has allowed the US to ignore its growing trade imbalances. It allows governments and fixed-rate borrowers to rip off their creditors. Importantly, it&#8217;s also the best way to lower real wages, since wages can never keep up with inflation, and falling real wages can help offset falling profitability. Finally, inflationary policies favor monopoly capitalists, since not all prices rise evenly. This amounts to a transfer of wealth from some producers to others, and some countries to others.</p>
<p>For the past four decades the US economy has been in decline, and this has led US leaders to maintain permanent inflation policies. At first the decline was slow and uneven, now it&#8217;s quick and uneven. The financial crisis is the continuation of four decades of trends at a much quicker pace.<br />
Policy makers, of course, say they don&#8217;t want inflation, or that they want a bit of it &#8211; 2 percent or so. What else would they say? &#8220;No, we want a weak dollar&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t go down to well with voters or bond-holders. At the same time, though, policymakers do not relish inflation. They understand the risks it entails, especially the risk of scaring away bond investors and the threat of very high inflation resulting from the collapse of confidence in a currency. But there is nothing they can do but swallow the bitter pill .  </p>
<p>So, yes, the dollar is in decline against stronger world economies. But this decline is relative, as many other economies &#8211; such as several in the EU &#8211; are in decline as well. Thus, the euro rising against the dollar is not necessarily a sign of the euro&#8217;s strength.</p>
<p>The weakness of the traditional powerhouse global economies, which have shown absolutely no signs of changing course over the past three years despite the near-collapse of the financial house of cards, means that emerging economy currencies may be  a better bet than either the dollar or the euro. More likely, though, is that we are going to see a decline in the purchasing power of ALL currencies (ie, global inflation) as the US and the ECB continue to flood the world with banknotes.</p>

<p>Bryan &#8211; You say that  &#8220;Others insist there is a covert operation underway by U.S. officials to broadly and desperately devalue the dollar&#8230;.  a more protracted decline in the dollar at the recent pace would mean very negative implications for both the U.S. and the rest of the world — no one wins. So a weak dollar conspiracy is not the answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>That opinion probably rests on an underlying assumption about what the agenda of the present Administration really is. I keep remembering Rahm Emmanuel&#8217;s statement, &#8220;Never let a good crisis go to waste.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Administration&#8217;s actions also support the assumption that its agenda is to keep the country in a perpetual multi-faceted state of crisis, so that increasing levels of government control of the citizenry may be achieved. Just my opinion.</p>

<p>Brian,</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a smart guy and this is your specialty, so I&#8217;m very humbly saying that I disagree with you.  Martin and Claus, and many others have laid it out quite clearly.  Our debt is being, and will continue to be monetized to fund our overwhelming obligations.  There is no other mathematical alternative other than outright default, which won&#8217;t likely happen as long as we own a printing press.  Therefore the US dollar is toast &#8211; no matter how anyone tries to spin it differently.  A short term bounce/rebound?  Sure OK.  Especially if equities tank again.  But ultimately, that means even more rapid printing.  Face it Brian, it&#8217;s over for the buck.  Soon.</p>

<p>I think if China wanted they could squash us like a bug.</p>
<p>Remember a weak dollar makes us a subserviant nation; and one does not go before the master to insist but on hands and knees to request.</p>
<p>Remember also, China did not put us in this position, but our own leaders along with ceo&#8217;s, etc. It was greed and all about living beyond our means, and that includes individuals, companies, and all in Washington.</p>
<p>We also have learned nothing from the collapse of the Soviet Union in that years of war take huge toll financially as well as emotionally.</p>
<p>our own leaders do not understand finances, economics, or war so I guess blaming the Chinese is a good thing.</p>

<p>Bryan was remarking primarily on the strength of the dollar not being as bad as some people would have us think. Even though the strength of the economy is not pleasing to us, it is not yet dead as it was back in 1931 during the great depression. We seem to forget, or just never knew, that the dollar was super-strong back during the depression. It was just that not many people had dollars. A strong dollar, an economy does not make. Bryan&#8217;s emphasis was not on the economy, it was on the strength of the dollar and he was and is right.</p>

<p>Bryan must be a member of the very well off. He should do some grocery shopping with the vast population of those that do, those that are impacted most by the constant reduction in the value of their hard earned dollars. Those who are well off can stand lots of inflation before they are seriously damaged . Unfortunately the poor and much of the middle class blame the more fortunate for their plight because they are not suffering like the less fortunate. However it is the socialist programs that often create these problems. The most recent such example is the programs of the recent past (1970′s through the mid 2000′s) that put people into home mortgages they couldn’t afford. This created  corruptions and hardships in our vast financial systems that will take years to correct. Unfortunately the poor will suffer the most because many of them think the socialist programs are their savior. Who can blame them if they continue to read articles like this one.</p>

<p>I agree with Dennis undedrstanding&#8230;.  it takes into account most of the variables.  I would add to it the importance of understanding of nature of the major actors on the global financaials markets.  Finance capitallism has worked so nicely for some.  The goverment is a pssive actor, while the major  global banks are the drivers. The unbelievalbe amout of liquidity is benifiting banks since they have access to these trillions of dollars which  they can invest in hgih returns in emerging economies. The sweet thing about this is if you have access to trillions in credit then when you pay back with cheaper dollars it doubles or tribles your profits&#8230;    very nice for those who can access this cheap credit.   the small actors and main street can only watch and suffer.</p>

<p>I too agree with the critics, Lin O, Jimmie, H. Bez, David X and Dennis McCormack. Their criticisms are excellent and backed with well a reasoned understanding of what western countries have been doing over the past 40 to 50 years.</p>
<p>My concern focuses on the current crop of &#8220;leaders&#8221; in the present US administration.  Can anyone point to any successful plan  implemented by the Obama&#8217;s Administration to put us on a sound financial foundation? </p>
<p>Obama and his gang of politicians show no interest in the concept of reducing our deficit and debt.  Based on his actions since becoming president it appears to me that he wants to see this country  fail.  Almost everthing he has done smacks of anti-USA.  If, GOD forbid, he gets reelected my hope for an optimistic future for our country probably is not going to happen.</p>
<p>If we end up with a new team of PATRIOTS (NOT POLITICIANS) in the 2012 election that are dedicated to reducing our debt, my optimiism will be rekindled and hopefully the US dollar will survive as the World Reserve Currency.</p>

<p>I agree, I agree, I agree. As a Canadian I am holding a % of my cash reserves in US dollars, with the expectation for a long term recovery. A definite stabilization of Global economies, with a clear leveling of the competitive balances is in process. And given the Chinese dynamic, their currency must increase to offset the normal pressures of their overheating economy. The current lower US dollar is a boon to the U.S domestic economy in the short term and will help greatly to &#8220;right the ship&#8221; eventually, provided the ideological nonsense from the extreme right in Washington, does not overshadow sensible and centrist fiscal planning.</p>

<p>To those that have posted a negative review of this piece. I have disagreed with Bryan many many times but I would add to my own assessment; </p>
<p>That one must &#8220;step back from the trees to clearly see the forest&#8221; The larger future Global picture frankly cannot be envisioned without rebounding and healthy US and Euro economies. They are a vital factor for Global economic stability. The time element may be up for debate, but any healthy Global planning cannot be envisioned or even functional, without these 2 key players!</p>

<p>Great post, Dennis M.  Although my reply to Mr. Rich&#8217;s article may not be as erudite and cogently formulated as his, I start from perspective that the current mess is not directly related to economics, although it forms its underpinnings &#8211; MORALITY.  The reason we Americans are in trouble is that we have been deceiving ourselves and each other.  We thought that we could enjoy the harvest without the planting and tending.  &#8220;Real estate prices always go up and everyone deserves a home, even though they may not be able to afford the mortgage right now.  Those mortgages will make great investments and we can trust their securitization to Wall Street.  Those who predict the collapse of Bear, Lehmann, AIG, GM, Fannie/Freddie are fearmongers.&#8221;   Is it any wonder that we elected people who now routinely lie to us?  &#8220;Inflation remains moderate by government measures.  It is our policy to maintain a strong dollar.  We have to pass it first in order to see what&#8217;s in it.  Bondholders should be paid first, right after the company&#8217;s union.  Cutting the budget more than 1% is extreme.&#8221; </p>
<p>I know this will sound too pessimistic, but I believe that our economic problems are no longer amenable to political solutions.  Will it make any difference whether the Dems or Reps win the next election?  As I recall, not even Ryan&#8217;s &#8220;extreme&#8221; budget takes into account interest on the debt.  Unless every category is on the table, including social security and defense (and I am pro-military), it is just a matter of time until horrendous inflation crushes the lower and middle classes.  Oh, for those of you who think that the Fed will stop QE at #2, please think about what happens if that were actually to occur.  The choice has already been made to clip the coin of the realm.  Given the current political paradigm, there is no going back.  IMHO, only an extreme event will shake us out of the fantasy.  Black Swan, anyone?</p>
<p>Mr. Rich, please tell me how we get out of this situation without (1) a substantial reduction in the standard of living for the majority of Americans, and (2) a substantial decline in the American empire?  I would agree that we will be among the last to go through the wringer due to our having the WR currency, our ability to feed ourselves plus half of the remaining world, and our top-dog military machine.  However, that will be small consolation to the 70 &#8211; 80% of Americans who will find themselves on the losing end when the dust settles.  It will be a vastly different America.  In fact, from the perspective of only 10 years ago, it already is.</p>

<p>I wanted to add that I have begun to unload my Gold holdings. I am convinced that with a leveling will come the inevitable increases in interest rates, which will drive the speculators from Gold and unhinge the upward trend on commodities and precious metals. I believe that new financial regulation will become the new Global reality, and their first target will be to dissemble the factors that permit speculators to unduly influence the stability of the commodities marketplace.</p>

<p>Finally a voice of reason with years of experience to back up his thesis.  Just perhaps Geithner and Bernanke actually know what they are doing rather than the constant doom and gloom scenarios and scare tactics that Weiss and others perpetually warn us about.  So I have decided to sit on the sidelines to watch it all playout and not to do anything foolish from an investment perspective.  I listen to all of it and then make very few changes.</p>
<p>Devaluing our currency is one way Geithner and Bernanke can force the hand of China to strengthen their currency since they have been totally unwilling to do so.  With their currency so low everyone else is at  definite trade disadvantage.  Let their currency be valued at what it is really worth and then the Chinese will become the consumers of the world. </p>
<p>We here in America have already consumed more than our fair share.  Spread the wealth around and let our exports be consumed by the rest of the world.  This  would encourage entrepreneurship and production in America which creates more jobs.  The truth is America can and does produce quality products.</p>
<p>Indeed, we have a long ways to go but instead of the constant barrage of criticism and the doom and gloom stories perhaps Bernanke has it right.   Without a doubt we have serious problems with our budget deficit climbing to astronomical and unsustainable levels but have you noticed the sky isn&#8217;t falling and as I sit on the sidelines watching, America hasn&#8217;t crumbled like many of these writers suggest it is on the very verge of economic and financial collaspe.  If America were to collaspe it would take the whole world with it and would cause such a global depression everything and everyone would be affected.</p>
<p>Thanks Bryan for a breath of fresh air as I, for one, am so turned off to these perpetual doom and gloom prophecies.  Let&#8217;s have a little faith that things are getting better instead of trashing Obama, Bernanke and Geithner!  I would just love for them to be so right and the rest of these doom and gloomers so wrong!  In the meantime, I shall take a wait and see approach to see which side prevails as not one of these &#8216;so-called&#8221; experts has it all figured out or all the answers.  My friends, history will tell it all!</p>

<p>William; so far, you have hinted at the problem. However, THE problem is not the economy or this article, The problem is that we have no conception of real money. The coinage act was explicit as was The Constitution as they said essentially &#8221; money of the realm will be in gold and silver coin&#8221; . Those FRN&#8217;s (federal reserve notes) are TOXIC. Every time we spend/use one, we extend the debt forward. I have had my house stolen from me by Wells Fargo Bank na. The 2 years I fought them, I sent them every legal form/document/affidavit demanding a response. Not even judicial, administrative notices, demand for to produce the note, quite claim, right to cancel, bankruptsy, notice of default,&#8230; crap&#8230;you name it folks. There is no separation of powers. The friggin judges are all sleeping with the banksters. We have been conned to believing we are on the land and under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. They are all long gone. We have been placed under maritime admiralty law.(ever notice the yellow fringe on the bottom of the flag in the court room. After 2 years, I came across some material that I recommend YOU ALL read&#8230;before its too late. It explains the where, when, why and how. Its even written in the common language that even a low class dirt farmer like myself could comprehend. PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.  Go to this web site and read it for yourself. There are even u-tube discussions from the author. <a href="http://www.newpeopleorder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.newpeopleorder.com</a>. The book most aptly named is called &#8216; They Own it All &#8216; (Including You) by Rowan  and  McDonald MD. I am on my fourth read folks. No rhetoric, just the facts. I will sum it up for you. The Great Ruse is coming to an end. The ever so, little man behind the curtain,  will soon be seen for who they are. ALL fiat currencys end badly especially if they have been poorly managed and maintained. Take a moment and go to the Trends Institute by Gerald Cilente. He has never been wrong on his claims. What were once wierd outlandish conspiracy theory&#8217;s are all becoming true. My take; Americans, because of their decadence,  apathy and denial WILL NOT awaken in time to save this Republic. Nothing short of Divine Intervention or some earth shattering cataclysm will be enough to shake the crap out of them. They are blinded by their entitlements and arrogance. Oh yes, we have our goodness but the balance has been tipped. In closing; long range food storage, silver and the lead to protect it all for Americans don&#8217;t have a clue what it means to go hungry or be in want.</p>

<p>I always look forward to reading your post and appreciate the information contained therein.  However I believe that some basic economic fundamentals are being overlooked in this article.  As long as the Federal Reserve continues to expand the money supply, the long term outlook for the dollar will inevitably be DOWN.  This conforms to the quantity theory of money which postulates that prices are a function of the ratio of the quantity of money in circulation to the quantity of commodities (dollars per pound of potatoes for example).  When the quantity of money is increased faster than the quantity of commodities the purchasing power of money declines, which is simply another way of saying that prices rise.</p>
<p>I’m well aware that there are other factors which influence the rise in prices such as the objective exchange value, subjective exchange value, and the marginal utility value of money as explained in Ludwig von Mises’ book “The Theory of Money and Credit.”  However, these have  relatively short term effects on long term changes in prices.</p>
<p>From the beginning of our Constitutional Republic and the implementation of Hamilton’s First U.S. Bank, inflationary policies have been in effect and our government has been in debt.  That debt was paid down to its lowest level during the Jackson Administration but the Civil War put an end to that.  A significant part of that debt has been incurred by issuing fiat money which is simply a deceiving phrase for legalized counterfeiting.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1914 the trend in U.S. inflation (expanding the money supply) moved into high gear.  For  example, wholesale prices rose 126.7 percent between 1914 and 1920.  This is documented in a book titled “Economics and the Public Welfare” by Dr. Benjamin McAlester Anderson who was economist for the Chase National Bank from 1920 to 1939.  In Chapter 7 of this book, Dr. Anderson says: (parenthetic words added)<br />
“Money in circulation and bank credit in the United States were enormously expanded as compared with the prewar (WWI) situation.  Commodity prices were enormously higher.”</p>
<p>The “roaring twenties” were caused by the FED’s policy of inflating their way out of the 1920 -1921 economic crisis during which wholesale prices dropped 107 points in one year.   Changes in Federal Reserve policy is what caused the 1929 stock market crash – not overproduction as the American people were lead to believe.  Again, quoting from Chapter 26 of Dr. Anderson’s book:</p>
<p>“Alarmed, the Federal Reserve authorities reversed their policy in the winter of 1927 -1928.  They sold Government securities.  They raised rediscount rates.”</p>
<p>In addition to that they raised margin requirements for securities purchases and marked down loan values.  This had the effect of forcing many speculators out of the stock market – thus it crashed.</p>
<p>Contrary to public opinion, the FED expanded the money supply during almost the entire 1930&#8242;s depression.  This expansion was primarily in the form of purchases of government securities to fund socialist programs such as the “New Deal.”  But hoarding of money by the people created the  illusion of a scarcity.  People were afraid of bank failures and loss of jobs and therefore kept their money in locked dresser drawers – like my father who lost his savings when the local farming community bank closed its doors.  In other words there was no shortage of money but it wasn’t circulating and this caused prices to drop.  Again, quoting from Dr. Anderson’s book:</p>
<p>“On March 12, 1933, at 10:00 P.M., the President delivered over the radio an address to the people, calling upon them to bring their money back to the banks, and assuring them that the banks which reopened would be good.<br />
“Immediately upon reopening of the banks and immense volume of hoarded currency poured in upon them.<br />
“The Federal Reserve Bulletin of May, 1933 (page 265), states that between March 4 and May 10 the total volume of currency returned was $1,595,000,000&#8243;.</p>
<p>Of course expansion of the money supply continued during WWII and has never completely stopped but there was a reduction of the rate of increase during the 1980s.</p>
<p>So what’s the point of all this?  The point is that an enormous amount of fraudulent money has been created between 1914 and now.  The thing that makes this confusing is that a lot of that money has gone into foreign hands and has been held out of circulation in the U.S. – more than $7 trillion due to the trade deficit alone.  This does not include all the foreign aid or bank loans to third world countries.  In other words there’s an enormous amount of dollars sitting in foreign hands which will eventually come back to our shores – it is already under way.  If all that money had stayed in the U.S., the dollar would already be worthless.</p>
<p>There’s a delay between cause (expansion of the money supply) and effect (rising prices).  In this case, almost a 100 year delay and this will blindside a lot of Americans.  It should be clearly understood that once newly created money is injected into the economy, it is almost impossible to get it out again.  It’s always in someone’s account, or possession, and banks can not simply take it out of people’s pockets.  Therefore, deflation (reduction in the money supply) is very difficult and rarely happens.  Contrary to popular opinion, a stock market crash does not create deflation if we define “deflation” correctly as a reduction in the money supply.  But prices fall.</p>
<p>Socialists have succeeded in confusing our language.  Calling rising prices “inflation” confuses cause and effect relationships.  We “inflate” a balloon by injecting additional air into it; we “inflate” the economy by injecting newly created money into it.  Injecting newly created money into the economy has many deleterious effects but the major is rising prices which steal from the producers by depreciating the purchasing power of the money they hold.  When newly created money is injected, it competes with the money already circulating for an existing supply of commodities.  Since the commodity supply has not yet increased, the additional demand drives prices up.   Inflation is also a form of capital consumption which reduces our competitiveness in international markets at a time when we need to be very competitive.  Yes, our export trade will be stimulated by the increasing foreign demand and our balance of trade will improve.  Socialist economists will undoubtedly take credit for improvement in the trade balance, but the effects will be detrimental instead of beneficial.  The money repatriated to our shores in demand for commodities will accelerate the rise in prices and everyone will suffer because of the depreciating purchasing power of the dollar.  We already see this happening.</p>
<p>Deflation is the converse of inflation, it’s a reduction in the money supply, not falling prices.  It’s true that deflation will cause prices to fall but so will a lot of other things.  For example: hoarding money simply means that people reduce their purchases of commodities, this results in unemployment and falling prices.  No deflation is taking place but real estate prices are falling.  If we are confused about the meanings of words, we will be confused about the solutions to economic problems.  In his great book “Human Action”, Ludwig von Mises was absolutely correct:</p>
<p>“What many people today call inflation or deflation is no longer the great increase or decrease in the supply of money, but its inexorable consequences, the general tendency toward a rise or fall in commodity prices and wage rates. This innovation is by no means harmless.  It plays an important role in fomenting the popular tendencies toward inflation.<br />
“&#8230; While merely fighting symptoms, they pretend to fight the root causes of the evil.  Because they do not comprehend the causal relation between the increase in the quantity of money on the one hand and the rise in prices on the other, they practically make things worse.” </p>
<p>The quantity theory of money is still in effect and when all the foreign held money comes flooding back to our shores in demand for commodities, securities, etc., etc., in addition to all the money Bernanke is creating, prices will skyrocket and the value of the dollar will plummet.  As a matter of fact, we are presently most likely looking at the early beginnings of hyperinflation.  If this is allowed to run its full course, it will be disastrous for Americans – and foreigners.  This will be a world &#8211; wide catastrophe unless we stop it now.</p>
<p>Bryan, you may be right about a short term “dead cat bounce” in the value of the dollar, but unless fiscal policies of the government change, and the FED is abolished, the long term trend will be inexorably down.</p>
<p>Sorry about the lengthy response but I feel strongly that simple solutions to complex problems often exacerbates instead of solving them.  This is a much more complex problem than indicated above and for anyone interested in obtaining a better understanding of money I would highly recommend Ludwig von Mises’ book “The Theory of Money and Credit.”</p>
<p>Your thoughts about these important issues are appreciated and I look forward to future publications.</p>

<p>Posted to &#8220;moderates website blog&#8221; initially when Mr Denmans comment was brought to my attention on that site. This is a copy of my commentary to that site.(with minor edits)</p>
<p>It would be a gargantuan task for me to do any complete thesis in retort to your well argued American comment to Bryan Rich. Be that as it may and as I noted in my comments, I have argued with Bryan many times myself. in particular my position on the Euro was and is still diametrically opposed to his. I seemingly have been right thus far&#8230;..:-) I also believe I am right as to the recovery of the dollar in the long term. Here he and I agree. Rare, but still one must follow ones own belief system.</p>
<p>The introduction by you of the Von MIses, or what is more commonly called the &#8220;Austrian school of theory&#8221; about money and credit, is always the typical fall back position of those usually opposed to the more popular and arguably more effective keynesian model for linear macro and micro capital and credit management, throughout the 20th century. Particularly the libertarian ideological belief system, and more modernly the Ayn Rand market modeling, as proposed during the arising of the &#8220;trickle down&#8217; philosophy for the last 25 years. I leave it to Mr Denman to tell us if he believes the results of this system or economic model has been acceptable? I never have, nor do I now! Results are telling! </p>
<p>It is always of interest to me how they (trickle downers) fall back upon the phrase &#8220;counterfeit money&#8221; to describe the activity of an economic capitalist democracy? They never offer an effective alternative to paper money as the essential promissory bridge for trade? Strange? Perhaps we will need to haul great bags of Gold bullion around? Probably on a horse and cart and with candles to light our path&#8230;.:-)</p>
<p>There is of course some validity to all economic modeling theory and most especially, as refers to promissory notes or fiat money. That the Austrian school has any more validity than the Keynesian model, is of course the cause of our ongoing great ideological divide?<br />
The choices made in the past, or even in the present capitalist and democratic systems, are supposedly and by intent to bring stability and leveling to the natural waves of the turbulent dynamic, of the &#8216;supply and demand&#8217; cycle. </p>
<p>I argue that the destabilizing we have been suffering in this past environment of boom and bust cycles, is directly as a result of the pitfalls and very weaknesses of the Austrian school or the Trickle down model if you like, of supply side economic theorum!</p>
<p>Mr Denman, although obviously astute, again limits himself to the purely narrow view of the current tragedy of the American economy. Much of what he says will indeed unfold domestically, and yes goods and services will inflate. But the overall effect of the leveling of the values of currencies Globally, will see I believe, an ultimate strengthening of the dollar against other currencies as the economy rebounds. One must never forget that the underpinnings of the US economy are still intensely strong and vibrant, and one must never underestimate them! </p>
<p>I believe Asian currencies will also be forced to escalate, as they must, to respond to their own set of unique inflationary challenges, brought on by the speed and intensity of their GDP growth. Again the child of their own supply and demand cycles. I am sure this has already begun just this week for China. </p>
<p>The necessary devaluation of the American dollar, results from a &#8220;hyper inflationary&#8221; cycle that has already in fact occurred! That was what was commonly called, in a boastful way by the trickle downers, &#8220;conspicuous consumerism&#8221; which was actually an overheated economy, fueled by massive and deliberately engineered demand with abundant access to easy credit. The resultant current monetary policy of the FED is exactly the medicine that is required to &#8216;right the ship and humble the crew&#8217;! Not very tasteful but I believe the essential steps to take.</p>
<p>I also have commented many times that the biggest danger to this recovery still remains ideological inanity. That forces on the extreme right would appear to deliberately and wantonly isolate and marginalize the American economy, at this crucial time, is to me paramount to national suicide! I wont repeat my many comments on this subject as I am sure you have become familiar with them by now? </p>
<p>The other essential matter is to let go of this hysteria about the FED and the narrow viewed economic jingoism, that will keep America down. Yours is a magnificent country and I know will arise stronger from this debacle of excessive greed and somewhat selfish arrogance. As light follows day all the analysis and second guessing in the world, will not change the fact that America is the essential economy needed for a healthy progressive Global community to prosper.</p>
<p>One other point &#8230;. There are 2 dollars that may need to be considered for future debate. It is likely that a new reserve currency could make it&#8217;s debut at some point in the future. While some sense of misplaced American pride may choose to feel injured and I can here the squawking of the ideological &#8220;boo birds&#8221;. I for one can foresee a national US dollar being indeed an extremely powerful unit of trade, in the Americas overall, given my belief in a strong and resurgent US economy within the next 5 years.<br />
In that case and if I pass on beforehand, my 3 sons will have a bunch of old US dollars to get rid of&#8230;..:-)</p>

<p>Good article even although a disagree. A weakening dollar trend is entrenched and was created by the actions of the fed. What is happening now is some other nations are changing policy and the market is rewarding those currencies accordingly. </p>
<p>I do believe that the US has seen the worst of the crisis and has made the necessary changes in its economy to survive the future. China on the other hand is about to enter a very tough phase and I don&#8217;t believe that they will emerge nearly as quickly as the US.</p>
<p>The US has a great private sector but the public sector is showing itself to be as inept as most government&#8217;s across the world. I am certain that the current administration is going to be sent out to pasture and the future in the US will be one of &#8216;small government&#8217;.</p>

<p>Mr Rich is clearly somewhat too objective and naive, and, hence, he omits from his analysis one of the major factors that have influenced politicians&#8217;  actions and designs throughout history and continue to do so..  IDEOLOGY!  Globalists like Obama, Geitner, and Bernanke  want a one world currency.   They know Americans would never tolerate it absent some financially catastrophic event in America tied to the currency. And that my friends is collapse of the dollar!  People and analysts keep saying that these guys &#8220;don&#8217;t get it&#8221; or that they don&#8217;t realize the error of their ways.   Baloney!  They are extremely smart men, and they know exactly what their doing.  It&#8217;s cold and calculated, and it will work!  They will have America clammoring for The Amero ( i.e. North American currency)  followed shortly behind by a one world currency</p>

<p>But I read somewhere, and it was a reliable source, that the Chinese Yuan is not &#8220;under-valued&#8221;. The analysis I read showed that the yuan is actually very much &#8220;over-valued&#8221; as it is! (mostly due to even greater stimulus in China than in the U.S.) Unfortunately that article made a great deal of sense and showed that claims of undervalued are not true. So overall these (contradictory) MoneyandMarkets reports are not helping much for trading.</p>

<p>Gary, I agree with you about the chinese Yuan. Our administration for years has been accusing the chinese of under devaluing the Yuan. Several months ago I read a report that there has been no evidence of the chinese doing that !  I am just shocked that our administration can accuse another nation without checking out the facts. I am so surprise that this could have happened.<br />
It looks like the administration is now under valuing the dollar causing it to drop against all major currencies!</p>

<p>G&#8217;day&#8230; America this was sent to me here in Melbourne Australia, from one of your country people it makes very good reading&#8230;..</p>
<p>THIS SENIOR CITIZEN NAILED IT! </p>
<p>Alan Simpson, Senator from Wyoming , Co-Chair of Obama&#8217;s deficit commission, calls senior citizens the Greediest Generation as he compared &#8220;Social Security&#8221; to a Milk Cow with 310 million teats. August, 2010.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a response in a letter from a unknown fellow in Montana &#8230; I think he is a little ticked off!   He also tells it like it is !</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- </p>
<p>&#8220;Hey Alan, let&#8217;s get a few things straight..</p>
<p>1. As a career politician, you have been on the public dole for FIFTY YEARS.</p>
<p>2. I have been paying Social Security taxes for 48 YEARS (since I was 15 years old. I am now 63).</p>
<p>3 My Social Security payments, and those of millions of other Americans, were safely tucked away in an interest bearing account for decades until you political pukes decided to raid the account and give OUR money to a bunch of zero ambition losers in return for votes, thus bankrupting the system and turning Social Security into a Ponzi scheme that would have made Bernie Madoff proud.</p>
<p>4. Recently, just like Lucy &amp; Charlie Brown, you and your ilk pulled the proverbial football away from millions of American seniors nearing retirement and moved the goalposts for full retirement from age 65 to age 67.  NOW, you and your shill commission are proposing to move the goalposts YET AGAIN.</p>
<p>5 I, and millions of other Americans, have been paying into Medicare from Day One, and now you morons propose to change the rules of the game. Why? Because you idiots mismanaged other parts of the economy to such an extent that you need to steal money from Medicare to pay the bills.</p>
<p>6.  I, and millions of other Americans, have been paying income taxes our entire lives, and now you propose to increase our taxes yet again. Why?  Because you incompetent bastards spent our money so profligately that you just kept on spending even after you ran out of money. Now, you come to the American taxpayers and say you need more to pay off YOUR debt.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, you label us &#8220;greedy&#8221; for calling &#8220;bullshit&#8221; on your incompetence. Well, Captain Bullshit, I have a few questions for YOU.</p>
<p>1. How much money have you earned from the American taxpayers during your pathetic 50-year political career?</p>
<p>2. At what age did you retire from your pathetic political career, and how much are you receiving in annual retirement benefits from the American taxpayers?</p>
<p>3. How much do you pay for YOUR government provided health insurance?</p>
<p>4. What cuts in YOUR retirement and healthcare benefits are you proposing in your disgusting deficit reduction proposal, or, as usual, have you exempted yourself and your political cronies?</p>
<p>It is you, Captain Bullshit, and your political co-conspirators called Congress who are the &#8220;greedy&#8221; ones.  It is you and your fellow nutcases who have bankrupted America and stolen the American dream from millions of loyal, patriotic taxpayers.  And for what? Votes. That&#8217;s right, sir. You and yours have bankrupted America  for the sole purpose of advancing your pathetic political careers. You know it, we know it, and you know that we know it.</p>
<p>And you can take that to the bank, you miserable son of a bitch.</p>
<p>If you like the way things are in America , delete this.  If you agree with what a fellow Montana citizen says, PASS IT ON!!!</p>

<p>Mr. Rich, you have provided the wave chart of US dollar, i believe it was 7 year period and some time ago, last year you pointed out that the low was created. Are you going to post the chart again any soon, as i believe the new low is making its progress now, which means the last wave prolongs for some time&#8230;?

<p>You wrote, &#8220;The Chinese have allowed their currency to appreciate a measly 3.6 percent against the dollar on average per year since de-pegging in 2005. Meanwhile their economy has grown by nearly 250 percent in the same time frame.&#8221;<br />
There is no way the Chinese economy has grown 250% in six years!  Its economy has grown 10% per year, which means it would take at least seven years to grow 100%.  What else are you telling us that isn&#8217;t true!?</p>

<p>You have to think globalist. Remember, discounting a collusion, a hybrid of many nations. so to speak, is not proven by saying it is a lose lose situation for all.</p>
<p>The globalist agenda means the erasure, or atleast &#8220;dotted&#8221; lone treatment of the former nation-state.</p>
<p>What governments who exist in a convenient past state of paradigm mind do not understand, is that Russia, the US, China and the rest, are not real as far as the powers that underpin their very existence, especially in the evolution of the financial architecture war which is the real impetus driving this whole mess.</p>
<p>While the world looks at the traditional maps of the former millennium, which by the way is gone, the new map is not polygonal areas, but points of power within those &#8220;powers&#8221; which are power dots to dots which paint a much different global picture than is commonly apprehended.</p>
<p>Collapse, or say persuasive positioning of the polygonal parts of the former nation-states is indeed favorable to connecting the dots in a new global definition; Collapse is necessary and moving towards those dots. The currency is the key to pull the underlying rug of the whole, the USDollar is the main thread in that weave. You know, a new world order, by economic and energetic, weapons based reapplication of power.</p>
