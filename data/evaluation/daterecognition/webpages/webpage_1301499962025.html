If the McCain campaign is hoping that a few presidential debates would swing this election, then really their campaign plan is pretty poor.  Looking at Obama's performances I am not sure that he has been playing to win exactly - his performances have been cool and focused, but hardly exhilirating.  I suspect rather that he has tried to 'draw' with McCain on these debates and thus neutralise him.  At this stage, Obama doesn't need to win any debate if he is ahead.  Perhaps if the race was closer, he might have felt more inclined to take a risk and take the fight back to McCain. <br><br>That news about Powell would add another shock element to this highly surprising campaign.  It would also be another devastating knock to McCain's campaign.<br><br>On that note, there's still 3 weeks to go.  McCain's windows of opportunities are growing smaller and smaller.  Obama's camapigns, hisotrically, have gained momentum in the last few weeks of a camapign (if his primary camapign is anything to go by).  To use an analogy that the US might appreciate - Obama's got plenty of clips left for his gun, but is McCain only left with blanks?</p>

I personally believe he got pole-axed by Bush's staff before having to give that blasted (and long-discredited) speech to the U.N. council.  Or, to use the modern phrase, Colin Powell got mightily "Thrown Under The Bus" as one of the endorsers of the Iraq war.<br><br>It was telling that he exited stage-left (along with several other people) as soon as Bush's first term was over.  That sort of redeemed him in my eyes.  <br><br>Powell still carries a lot of "street cred" with most of Americans, including (I'm wildly assuming, here) all-important moderates and Independent voters.  If he were to give his endorsement--and his reasons are well thought-out and articulated--this, along with other snowballing factors, would finally put paid to McCain's campaign.  No matter what else he may try--above or below-board--to eke out a victory in the next three weeks, I truly don't think John McCain's campaign would survive Powell endorsing Obama.</p>

Obama's was generally good but looked strange when chuckling to himself, head down.<br><br>- McCain lost points for being erratic the whole debate, constantly changing tack in trying (and failing) to land a heavy blow.  Obama lost points for being slightly dull and lacklustre, and not criticising McCain much at all (I refer to <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=CPTB7-ecDC8&amp;NR=1">this wonderful piece</a> by The Onion).<br><br>etc. etc. etc.<br><br>Therefore the debate was a draw.

Obama was dull compared to his many electrifying speeches and could have done a lot better, but won on policy which is surely the most important issue right now.<br><br>P.S. Bob Schieffer got points for making candidates answer the questions and debate with each other, but lost them on saying "climate control" instead of "climate change".  Brilliant.<br><br>P.P.S.

On body language , tone and conduct, the candidate who appeared presidential was Obama; McCain looked like a septuagenarian schoolboy: someone who has never really emotionally grown-up, and he was petulant rather than purposeful about Lewis and Ayers, and about Obama's financial advantage.<br><br>Looking about this morning, there are some who clearly want to say that this was McCain's best debate. Perhaps it was. If so, best was not good enough. The first reactions on CNN and CBS suggest that Obama kept his base happy and re-assured independents; whereas McCain, while he kept his base happy was unable to make Obama's base doubt or the independent voter swing. For what it is worth, this is the comment on CNN:<br><br>"Fifty-eight percent of debate watchers questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll said Democratic candidate Obama did the best job in the debate, with 31 percent saying Republican Sen. John McCain performed best.<br><br>The poll also suggests that debate watchers' favorable opinion of Obama rose slightly during the debate, from 63 percent at the start to 66 percent at the end. The poll indicates that McCain's favorables dropped slightly, from 51 percent to 49 percent."<br><br>What that indicates is that McCain did not succeed in doing what he needed to do, whereas Obama did; and perhaps most crucually Obama looked like a President, McCain did not.<br><br>I'm sure that Powell's endorsement will reassure those independent voters that worry about Obama's national security profile and his experience; that takes away McCain's last card. Equally important is the fact that the markets have started to focus on the long-term consequences of all these bail outs for growth and the global economy. They've realised that the next 5-10 years in economic growth terms is going to be rather dull because of all the extra government debt that has been taken on and the writedown in capital assets. As a consequence the stock market has resumed its fall with perhaps another 15-20% to go before it finds a real floor from whence it can consolidate. Every day the market drops between now and the election is a bad day for McCain.<br><br>I think  the question now is whether Obama's lead consolidates at about 6-8% or whether it snowballs into a 380-400ECV victory.</p>

Sorry I didn't realise the election is a 4-yearly entertainment bash.  All elections are boring in some degree.  SO WHAT.  Elections are important, and this election is more important than any in recent history.  Whether or not people found it less entertaining than Saturday Night Live like you seem to have is completely besides the point - people will VOTE because it's important.  If you want to give Palin a medal for being some kind of Christian fundamentalist court jester, off you go, don't let anyone delay you on your way to Alaska.<br><br>Sarah Palin was a brazenly cynical choice for VP - McCain's attempt to 1) pick up women voters from Hillary Clinton, and 2) appeal to a hardcore Republican base who never found him convincing, all in one go.  Thankfully for the former, it appears many women don't connect with her just because she has a vagina, and the media excitement has worn off / been tarnished by the shocking, lazy and last-Republican-resort of the "terrorist" tag.  Thankfully for the latter, many people are realising this aligns her with the current administration which has FAILED.<br><br>Her ignorance and her negative attitude make her entirely unsuitable for a springboard to the most powerful job in the world - being donated a crash course in foreign policy with U.N. leaders was quite frankly embarrassing for everyone - and just because they make some Americans feel "cosy" and that she is "just like them" doesn't qualify her as a politician.<br><br>Voting for someone who is "just like you" shows an appalling lack of brainpower, especially after the last 8 years, especially after Bush was someone "just like you", and especially when it's Sarah Palin.<br><br>Your comment about "mixed genes" is not quite racist itself, but you suggest the commenters on this board are, which is 1) incorrect and 2) unacceptable.<br><br>I'm sure she bakes a wonderful moose pie.</p>

There comes a point in a political campaign where if the media concludes one side is a certain winner that they start thinking of the effect on themselves if they annoy the soon to be president/primeminister.

It is time for all of us to grow up and face responsibility for our decisions.<br><br>Those that are concerned about the tax burden of the wealthiest segment of our society should vote for McCain, but those who are struggling to make ends meet, who worry about losing their jobs or small pensions, who have to make a choice between buying food or paying medical co-pays or utility bills, and those that have to look a son or daughter in the eye and tell them they can't afford to pay $1K tuition in a community college have a clear choice this election year: OBAMA. <br><br>McCain's commitment to the business community is commendable, and it is a consistent with Republican convictions, but at a time when our country is literally on the verge of bankruptcy what we need are responsible fiscal policies to balance at least reduce our budget deficits while at the same time stimulating the economy, and work programs to put people back to work.<br><br>Obama's healthcare solution, while not perfect, would not only make care available to millions of Americans who do not have access to one of our most basic needs, but it would actually alleviate corporate operating costs making them more competitive.   Last, but not least, Obama's focus on education is, ostensibly, the most important of all his proposals as it focuses on the need to prepare future generations of Americans for the challenges of the future and ensure we all have the same opportunities to succeed.<br></p>

She is unqualified and foolish and her gender makes no difference. And actually she IS run of the mill. She is a cartoon-like dullard, much like Bush, which the non-thinking masses decided seemed like a good thing. But what the non-thinking masses need to get comfortable with is that the person who is ultimately quailified to hold the most powerful position in the world (or so they say) has to be highly intelligent and refined, far beyond the average Joe Six Pack in areas like history, economics, public policy, and international politics. That person isn't like the typical middle American soccer Mom or Dad, nor should they be.<br><br>McCain chose her as a token because most Republicans see all women as the same--so put one on the ticket and catch all the Hillary birds in the net.

I don't think many would buy that.<br><br>The key for McCain is the independent voters. They decide the election. I think Obama scored a lot of points in other topics: health care, education, abortion, energy policy. The first half hour of the debate was flat for Obama, but it did not cost much in the end as he tilted the debate in his favour. I think in the end his cool did work to  his favour with McCain's all the grimaces, and anger, and contempt.<br></p>

In the 2008-09 year, all people get a personal exempt allowance of GBP 6035, the next 34800 is taxed at 20%, and after that (ie. 40835) tax is set at 40%; or put another way, the maximum UK tax rate kicks in at about US 70K, whereas in the States it starts at 250K plus.

Scoring debating points off the other candidate would not have served either side.  Over the course of this very long campaign, Americans have had ample opportunities to learn what each candidate's policies would be and what their basic personalities are.<br><br>The debates were a chance for voters to measure the candidates side by side.  What they were looking for was a sign of leadership ability: the ability to stay calm in a tense situation; command of relevant facts; ability to make a cogent case; the willingness to build consensus around a program or idea.  Everyone in the country knows that we are in a very tough situation (of our own making) with the financial crisis and two wars.  Everyone knows the personality of the president and the administration that got us into this mess.  People are perhaps looking for the polar opposite in the hope that the next president can find a way out for us.<br><br>Obama didn't need to impress anyone with his eloquence or his intelligence.  Even his detractors agree that he is both highly intelligent and highly eloquent.  He actually abandoned his eloquent speaking style from the primary campaign as soon as he became nominee.  He had to be calm, reassuring, and in control of himself.  McCain had to do the same things, but for him that is a higher bar to jump over and he didn't make it.<br><br>As for Colin Powell, after the first Gulf War his stature in the US was close to that of Eisenhower after World War II.  He projects the same air of calm competence as Eisenhower, actually.  He is respected  for his personal qualities as much as for his military career.   Many people from across the political spectrum would have been comfortable seeing him as president even if they wouldn't have voted for him.  There was a lot of speculation that he would enter politics after he retired from the military.  <br><br>Powell may have broken any last remaining reluctance for people to see a black man in the presidency and thus may have helped Obama before Obama even announced his candidacy.</p>

What more can he do?  Is he credible?  Judging from Obama's real relationships with Acorn, the founder of the Weather Underground, Reverend Wright, his statements to Joe the plumber, his time in office, his actions amd statements to date about these relationships, the comments of Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden during the primary season saying he's unfit to be Commander in Chief, McCain is right on target?  Is it enough?  People get the government they deserve.  McCain does not seem to have what it takes to make a good president but Obama will likely be a catastrophe that will make the last 8 years seem paradise by comparison.  Yet it appears 3 weeks before the election, Obama who is the greater of the two evils will be the next president.  Will America come to its senses?  Given how justifiably angry it is with those currently in power it doesn't seem that way.   Out of the frying pan into the fire.  Small wonder anyone who still has money in their pockets is clutching on to it for dear life.</p>

I may not agree with you on every point, but I do appreciate the fact that you expose me to a different perspective. <br><br>The people who regularly post--you, too, deserve praise. I have enjoyed this blog so much more because of the people who are posting. As with Justin Webb, I have not always or consistently agreed with everyone, but most of the regulars keep me thinking and wondering long after I leave this page. A lot of people who post to blogs are so obviously partisan and overly emotional that I read it and forget it instantly. Thanks for being thoughtful and striving to be informed. <br><br>As for the debate--I appreciate the fact that Justin Webb is trying to develop a path for someone to get out of the hole he is in. I have always had a soft spot for John McCain, and I still sometimes find something he has said intelligent or compassionate when I read it in the paper. Unfortunately, in these televised debates, I have found the whiff or stench of desperation to be a bit too overpowering. I wish it were not so, but it is.<br><br>My husband is one of those all-important independent voters, and he is still struggling to make up his mind about who he will vote for. In my mind, it is pretty clear from the debates that if I want my tax money to go to defense and not education or health care or alternative fuel technology, then I should pick McCain. If I value those other things, I need to pick Obama. <br><br>According to economists, If I want the economy to get better, I should pick Obama. If I make less than a certain amount, then Obama's tax plan makes more sense for me. If I were wealthier than most people, then I would save the most money under McCain.<br><br>If I want to win the war in Iraq, I should pick McCain. If I just want to stop spending ten billion dollars a month on the war in Iraq and don't care about "victory," I should pick Obama. <br><br>These are the things that matter. Whether McCain breathed laboriously or Obama smirked arrogantly is meaningless in the face of picking the path that is most in line with the values and assumptions of the majority of Americans.</p>

The views expressed by the pundits after the debate (generally that McCain had done well) were just that, the views of pundits. The poll results they released were based on the views of potential voters - who are different people, with different perspectives and priorities. It was not a poll of the 7 or 8 pundits they had on. How can you not grasp this? And how can you maintain that CNN is 'a tool of the Democratic party' when you have stated yourself that the views of some of their pundits were favourable to McCain?</p>

But I agree with you that in the US you are the race that other people consider you to be.  Historically there was an advantage for African Americans who were light-skinned enough to "pass."

Some of them aren't willing to look any further than their immediate monetary gain.  The idea of putting your shoulder to the wheel for the good of the larger community is just foreign to them.  It's part of the reason why it's still the rust belt here.  No one was suggesting  to Joe the Plumber that he couldn't buy the business and make over 250,000 dollars; he would just pay slightly higher taxes on what would still be a very large income.  And thanks to the laissez-faire policies of the current administration, he probably can't get a loan to buy the business now anyway.  <br><br>I once had a neighbor who couldn't see why her property taxes should support the local schools when she didn't have children.

Many of us know the liabilties of John McCain, but many don't seem to see through the immensely partisan and everchanging Barack Obama.  This is one election where I will not be voting for either party, and this last debate cemented that conviction.  Obama, in the debate before, continually rolled his eyes; he even interrupted the moderator several times, and the final time the man gave in, in order to state some point we've most likely heard before.  That type of disrespect and churlish behavior is unwarranted and hardly *presidential,* yet Obama gets a pass, as he usually has.  Barack Obama has rarely (and I'm being generous here) been held acountable for his negativity or for his position changes done for political expediency.  First, the primary against Hillary Clinton was a smashfest of sexism, and Obama, contrary to countering all of the negative ads and spin, reveled in it while maintaining his distance.  Sen. Clinton was pitted not against just Barack Obama, but also againt the mainstream media AND the Democratic party's ruling elite.  That she came within a hair of trouncing him, and she did trounce him on Super Tuesday, is remarkable.  She was asked to *step down for party unity* after Iowa; however, after she won a resounding victory on Super Tuesday, did anyone ask Obama to *step down for party unity?* No.  Obama's campaign pulled the race card on Pres. Bill Clinton, and on Geraldine Ferraro.  His campaign repeatedly went negative, and he outspent her with the aid of MoveOn.org, a group I left over their terrible behavior, only to eak out a win, and only because of the corruption inherent in the antiquated caucases.  Then come more of Barack's lies.  He's first against FISA, and then he's for it.  He states he will accept public financing, and then he reverses himself.  He is involved with ACORN, and they have admitted to registering 1.2 mn voters during the primaries, and for Barack Obama, so I wonder if Sen. Clinton wasn't manipulated out of a win, though few if any in the MSM seem to address this.  Barack Obama touts his knowledge yet he states *we need more Arabic speaking people in Afghanistan* when the country speaks Dari and Bashtu.  He throws his white grandmother under the bus when he discusses Jeremiah Wright, and then to distance himself from Wright, I felt thre was a carefully orchestrated event where Wright *went crazy* in public, thereby allowing Barack the ability to distance himself completely. Not one word has been heard from Wright. Coincidence or another manipulation? I feel the latter.  Barack Obama is the darling of the media and the Democratic party, yet he has offered very little in the way of true change.  His oratory soars while the substance in his speeches is as thin as the ozone in Antarctica.  He was against drilling, and now he's for it.  He voted against capping credit card interest rates, and now he lambasts these companies for gouging.  He accused Sen. Clinton of serving on the board at Wal-mart while his wife served on the board of Treehouse Foods, a supplier to Wal-Mart. During the debate last night, while it was hardly enjoyable to listen to McCain, it was equally challenging to watch Barack Obama smile and snicker, much as he has the last two debates.  When asked about when life begins, he retorts *That's above my pay grade.*  He should have known the question would be asked, yet that's his response?  He funnels moneys to ACORN and he does very little to nothing for the Latino community, whose votes he now desperately needs and to whom he's now courting.  He is against gay marriage, and he refused a photo with San Francisco Mayor Newsome because *That man supports gay marriage.* In addition, he has an infamous ex-gay ministry singer (who believes all gays are diseased and need to be cured) at his rally, and then he says *I didn't know.*  It seems he's received a nice little ride from the media, and the Democratic top brass and old boy network sank Sen. Clinton, or did they really?  So no. I don't believe Obama is a bringer of change.  Barack Obama is a bringer of his own ego into the White House, and this constant drumbeat of *nowhere in the world could my story have happened* is once again the ugliness of US-centric thinking that isolates us from the rest of the world.  In fact, when Barack Obama admits he can't speak French, I do wonder for all his professed love of Europe why he didn't take some classes in his pedigreed academic career in at least two other languages.  The general's endorsement for me is a nail, in the coffiin of anyone he endorses.  I despise that man, and all that he did.  He was not used.  He was a part of that corruption. People aren't used without their permission, so endorse away general.  As for me, I see little hope for the people of the USA if either of these candidates is elected.  It's downright depressing.  Obama sounds good but is all frosting.  After a while you develop a bad belly ache. McCain is simply struggling to get any coherent ideas across.  We in the USA have had to lower the bar far too many times, and I'm through doing that.  My one hope was that Sen. Clinton would take her 18 mn votes and run as an Independent thus giving the USA a third party with some numbers, but that hasn't happened.  In any case, say a kind word for the USA.  I know we'll need it.  I, for one, am not looking forward to November 4 regardless of the *winner,* for his win will be our loss.</p>

And in spite of Palin's best efforts, there is really nothing to energize most of the religious conservatives in the state the way there was in 2004.  They need jobs too.</p>

He walked out on the street to ask a politician a question. Now because a candidate chose to take his question and elevate it in a debate he has been placed under the harsh glare of the media. <br><br>So now we know he isn't licensed as a contractor or a plumber, that he is registered (by mistake) to vote under the wrong name (technically that makes him guilty of voter fraud as he voted in the primaries) and he is a registered Republican. Now John McCain has an ad out featuring him.<br><br>During the last election a local farm placed a huge Bush Cheney sign by the road. I called in their a couple of weeks after Bush was reelected and the owner looked pretty down. Sales at his farm stand, his most profitable, were down a lot. I said 'Jeez Jack, did ya think the sign may have had anything to do with it? I mean, now a lot of folks know your politics'. There is no sign up this year. And I'm pretty sure a Kerry sign would have the same effect.<br><br>Even my local gun store has an Obama and a McCain sticker up and the owner and his son are very clear theirs is a house divided. Smart really.<br><br>I fear poor Joe may now be out of business because he was made a football. That would be a crying shame, he's done nothing wrong.<br><br>Sad Sam</p>

And even if he did, how can he accuse Obama of being "socialist" simply because he'd be paying an extra $2.47 per day in taxes?

And not a word about Todd Palin and his Alaskan secessionists  - despite the fact they were formed by Voegler, who was supported by the state of Iran.  Then we have to listen to McCain prattle on about ACORN and how he's offended - after two stolen elections and years of disgusting voter suppression tactics from the right.
