<B>The Empire of Darkness Series #26: Neocon Deceptions And Other Such Fakies</B><BR>
<BR>
Hello everyone!<BR>
<BR>
Exceptionally I have another compilation for you this week, for obvious reasons, as you'll see below.<BR>
<BR>
Major Barbara ukpeacearmy@yahoo.co.uk&gt; wrote to me today:<BR>
<BR>
Dear Jean: I appreciate that your intentions are truly well-meant but I have to ask why a special vigil for London when this kind of thing happens every day in Bhagdad? I say this as a British person who is deeply affected by what has happened in London - but what makes it any worse than what is happening in Iraq? I think it's time people stopped thinking of West as more important than the rest. Peace, Major B<BR>
<BR>
And my reply was:<BR>
<BR>
I also thought the same as you that this is a daily occurrence - and far worst at that! - in Iraq. But the large faked &quot;suicide&quot; attacks in Iraq (most being &quot;manufactured&quot; by the occupying force to justify its continued presence so as to maintain order!) are for domestic &quot;consumption&quot;. The London bombings are for global effect and are part of a plan to further suppress civil liberties and maintain their increasingly slippery hold on power.<BR>
<BR>
True, any and all sufferings, wherever it happens, is just as intolerable, and so Western tragedies - which actually pales in comparison to the daily occurrence of over 30,000 children dying worldwide of preventable causes - should not matter more. But this event IS important because of the well orchestrated media frenzy surrounding the London bombings, a carefully designed secret operation planned and executed by government operatives and not some ridiculously named and previously unknown &quot;terrorist&quot; organization that they instantaneously pulled out of their hat as they did with the mother of all insider jobs on 9-11 -- remember the Arab passports that miraculously fell intact from the sky and were presented as THE &quot;evidence&quot; that CIA-created al-Qaida was the culprit for the plane attacks? A similar thing happened just a few hours after the London bombings. A funnily worded message &quot;appears&quot; on some website and, presto, all media feature it as evidence that the culprits have been positively identified with absolute certainty! C'mon! Are we all so gullible!<BR>
<BR>
So in conclusion, we must always remember that there is always more than what meets the eye, and that the media/government litanies of lies should NEVER be trusted.<BR>
<BR>
Peace to you as well!<BR>
<BR>
Jean<BR>
<BR>
And since this article - amongst many others below - does an excellent and fairly lucid analysis of this event, I'm including it right away so you don't miss it...<BR>

London blasts boost Bush and Blair<BR>
 <BR>
By Henk Ruyssenaars Online Journal Guest Writer<BR>
 <BR>
'Red Alert' all over Europe: Either MI5, MI6, Scotland Yard, the London Metropolitan police and the rest of their law enforcers are incompetent, or something else is going on. It's 9/11 revisited, including all the overused expressions. <BR>
<BR>
EUROPE, July 7, 2005 (FPF)&#151;The question who profits? concerning the Madrid-like 9/11 scenes in London, where bomb blasts tore apart a bus and rocked five subways, will not be heard for a while. And also not heard nor seen for a while in all mainstream media will be the valid protests against the US government's lies surrounding the 9/11 disaster and the illegal neocon wars fomented by many of the criminal heads of state, which also are present at the G8 meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland.<BR>
 <BR>
The explosions silenced many more than intended, and from that point of view, the criminals who did this must be the stupidest terrorists around; boosting Bush and Blair's bad image at a time when opinion polls had them in the gutter and they needed it most.<BR>
 <BR>
Because that is the immediate effect, apart from some hundreds of millions of profit in blood money made in the stock markets.<BR>
 <BR>
But also the protest movement has partly been wounded and is blasted away for a while, meaning the G8's Bilderberg-agenda with it's fake 'help' for Africa* can be accepted without further criticism or ado. And again for some time, nobody will dare to criticize the permanent crimes against humanity in the neocon's War of Terror by the US and it's criminal allies, which is one of the main reasons for global resistance which is called terror.<BR>
 <BR>
Bush backing Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende, who is a 'Christian' neocon shame for the country, said on Dutch State TV during a press conference: ''that attention was heightened, especially at the borders,&quot; like in other European countries and even in the US. The spineless Netherlands government is an abject, sorry example of an American 'Lapdog of War.'<BR>
 <BR>
As this is written some hours after the blasts, according to the BBC and, of course, CNN, there is a new 'Arab' group with a 'terror claim': 'on a web site which also is used by al Qaida.' The terror in London is thus said to be claimed by 'a secret European branch of Al Qaida' nobody ever heard about before. Have a look: What's Al Qaida?<BR>
 <BR>
The US 'Truth Ministry'<BR>
 <BR>
As everybody reading this knows, anybody can set up a web site, and Donald Rumsfeld's 'Truth Ministry' in Washington and surroundings&#151;the Lie Factory, as it's called&#151;has spent hundreds of millions of American tax dollars in globally spreading 'fake news' already for years. Rumsfeld himself has confirmed it. A huge US neocon 'deception industry' fights the 'media war,' fervently brainwashing as many as possible for as long as possible, via their mainstream media, too.<BR>
 <BR>
So, and again as usual, all major global mainstream media immediately followed in the tracks of the disgusting propaganda mills CNN and BBC, declaring the dreadful bombing to be 'an act of terror' by al Qaida, the 'Red Pimpernel' of the US neocon War of Terror.<BR>
 <BR>
A London police chief said that they had found traces of explosives at the scene of one of the blasts. One hopes it will be the task of an independent laboratory&#151;and not a state one&#151;to examine eventual evidence, making the test results acceptable.<BR>
 <BR>
At the same time avoiding the now infamous fraudulent behavior before the illegal Iraq war started, when Bush and Blair with their crooked cronies decided long before that: &quot;the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
As stated in the uncovered Downing Street Memos* from Sir Richard. Dearlove, the head of the UK's secret intelligence service MI6.<BR>
 <BR>
Asleep Again?<BR>
 <BR>
It is known that 'their' law enforcement groups have all possible ultra-modern electronics which are used to track everybody, including&#151;they hope&#151;all presumptive terrorists. Now it's said bombings or other terror acts cannot be prevented, so apparently all the hundreds of millions invested could not find nor trace the whereabouts or movements of the 'barbarians,' as Blair called them.<BR>
 <BR>
It must be quite a professional group again which planned and executed this horrible bombing, which&#151;like in Madrid&#151;must have taken a long time to plan and coordinate, and that while anything 'Arab' is under heavy scrutiny in all countries like England or Holland, slavishly following the scary US neocon blueprint.<BR>
 <BR>
Metropolitan police Chief Ian Blair, in his first statement via the state's BBC 2 hours after the blasts, said there was no need to worry about help. &quot;This is something we have planned and prepared for,&quot; he confirmed, while, in the meantime, Sky TV reported that the army already was in the center of the city 'to maintain law and order.'<BR>
 <BR>
The immediate conclusion however must be, that all agents and other people responsible at MI5, MI6, Scotland Yard, the London Metropolitan Police, the 'Bobbies' in the street and all the secret and intelligence services like the CIA, the Mossad and others have been asleep again. Like they were asleep in the US when 9/11 was set up.<BR>
 <BR>
Condolences and sympathy, of course, should overwhelmingly go out to the families of the dead, and all people who have been wounded in 'England's 9/11.'<BR>
 <BR>
The perpetrators must absolutely be found and punished, without them disappearing in the American Gulag.<BR>
 <BR>
WHOEVER THEY MAY BE.<BR>

"The London bombings remind me of the Madrid, Istanbul, and Bali bombings. No one is ever caught. Stereotypically rabid Arabs are blamed. And innocent people everywhere suffer the consequences.When are we going to put together the pieces and see that this worldwide terror threat that is so ballyhooed in the totally corrupt establishment press is nothing more than stage-managed chaos designed to further consolidate the profit-making power of the super-rich, that all these senseless murders are nothing more than anecdotal sacrifices to the financial plans of the capitalist titans who control most of the world and covet the rest of it?Will we ever realize what this awful game really is?"<BR>

"[Knowingly revealing Plame's name and undercover status to the media]...is a violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act and is punishable by as much as ten years in prison," notes the Washington Post. Unmasking an intelligent agent during a time of war, however, surely rises to giving aid and comfort to America's enemies--treason. Treason is punishable by execution under the United States Code. How far up the White House food chain does the rot of treason go? "Bush has always known how to keep Rove in his place," wrote Time in 2002 about a "symbiotic relationship" that dates to 1973. This isn't some rogue "plumbers" operation. Rove would never go it alone on a high-stakes action like Valerie Plame. It's a safe bet that other, higher-ranking figures in the Bush cabal--almost certainly Dick Cheney and possibly Bush himself--signed off before Rove called Novak. For the sake of national security, those involved should be removed from office at once.Rove and his collaborators should quickly resign and face prosecution for betraying their country, but given their sense of personal entitlement impeachment is probably the best we can hope for. Congress, and all Americans, should place patriotism ahead of party loyalty."<BR>

&quot;What we are dealing with is not a debt forgiveness program, but a &quot;reimbursement&quot; process which directly serves the interests of the creditors. The deal constitutes a much needed &quot;social safety net&quot; for the multilateral creditors. It ensures a cash flow towards these institutions, while maintaining the World's poorest countries in the stranglehold of the IMF and the World Bank. It also prevents these countries from declaring default on their external debt. President Bush has made it very clear. The money paid to the World Bank on behalf of the countries, will be &quot;taken out of existing aid budgets. &quot;The &quot;debt forgiveness&quot; program, even if it is accompanied by an increase in foreign aid commitments, will result in a significant compression of real foreign aid flows to the highly indebted countries. The proposed increases in foreign aid commitments are fictitious since the money is intended for the multilateral creditors. And the deal will only be implemented if the indebted countries promise to carry out the usual gamut of &quot;free market&quot; reforms, under IMF/World Bank supervision. An added condition emanating directly from the Bush administration pertains to &quot;governance&quot;. It requires these countries to &quot;democratize&quot; on the US model under Western supervision, as well as carry out &quot;free elections&quot; on the example of Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot;<BR>

Why the People Must Judge<BR>
<a href="http://www.peoplejudgebush.org/">http://www.peoplejudgebush.org/</a><BR>
George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and many other right wing zealots in the U.S. government have conspired to wage an illegal war of aggression against Iraq, kidnap and torture civilians around the world, attack civilians and medical facilities in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. These crimes violate U.S. law, the U.S. Constitution, the Hague and Geneva conventions and other treaties and conventions. There is no question that the U.S. is responsible for war crimes, the question is who will stand up to the Bush Adminstration. Who can question the U.S.? No politician will speak out. No court will take the case. No international organization is willing to challenge the U.S. No other nation dares to risk retribution from the U.S. government by even raising the issue. Only the people can challenge these crimes. Only by raising a public hue and cry so loud that the issue cannot be politely ignored will this horrific crime spree be stopped. Join us in calling for the impeachment and indictment for war crimes of Bush, Rumsfeld, Negroponte and others. CLIP<BR>

(...) For more than a year, in public speeches around the country and in conversations with a number of you, I have predicted that the leaking from the White House of Valerie Plame's identity to columnist Robert Novak, in violation of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, would ultimately bring the demise of George W. Bush and his criminal minions.Today, it appears, that demise could be imminent. But the nation desperately needs your help -- NOW.<BR>

Official Total of 1,841 US Dead to date (and rising) U.S. Military Personnel who died in German hospitals or en route to German hospitals have very rarely been counted. They total about 6,210 as of 1 January, 2005. The ongoing, underreporting of the dead in Iraq, is not accurate. The DoD is deliberately reducing the figures. A review of many foreign news sites show that actual deaths are far higher than the newly reduced ones. Iraqi civilian casualties are never reported but International Red Cross, Red Crescent and UN figures indicate that as of 1 January 2005, the numbers are just under 100,000. by Brian Harring, Domestic Intelligence Reporter - Note: There is excellent reason to believe that the Department of Defense is deliberately not reporting a significant number of the dead in Iraq. We have received copies of  manifests from the MATS that show far more bodies shipped into Dover AFP than are reported officially. The educated rumor is that the actual death toll is in excess of 7,000. Given the officially acknowledged number of over 15,000 seriously wounded, this elevated death toll is far more realistic than the current 1,400+ now being officially published. When our research is complete, and watertight, we will publish the results along with the sources In addition to the evident falsification of the death rolls, at least 5,500 American military personnel have deserted, most in Ireland but more have escaped to Canada and other European countries, none of whom are inclined to cooperate with vengeful American authorities. (See TBR News of 18 February for full coverage on the mass desertions) This means that of the 158,000 U.S. military shipped to Iraq, 26,000 either deserted, were killed or seriously wounded. The DoD lists currently being very quietly circulated indicate almost 9,000 dead, over 16,000 seriously wounded* (See note below. This figure is now over 24,000 Ed) and a large number of suicides, forced hospitalization for ongoing drug usage and sales, murder of Iraqi civilians and fellow soldiers , rapes, courts martial and so on.

Nearly 9,000 U.S. troops dead? A NATIONWIDE CALL FOR INFO FROM SURVIVORS.<BR>
<a href="http://baltimore.indymedia.org/newswire/display/10554">http://baltimore.indymedia.org/newswire/display/10554</a><BR>
Has the Bush administration drastically understated the U.S. military death count by redefining &quot;death&quot;? The following article suggests that it has, and it calls for a nationwide campaign to honor deceased service members by naming and counting them. According to the article: &quot;...DoD lists currently being very quietly circulated indicate almost 9,000 [U.S. military] dead&quot;; this far exceeds the &quot;official&quot; death count of 1,831. How can this be? It's largely because &quot;U.S. Military Personnel who died in German hospitals or en route to German hospitals have not previously been counted.&quot;  In other words, &quot;death&quot; has been redefined.

The Zarqawi Phenomenon (July 6)<BR>
<a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/070605C.shtml">http://www.truthout.org/docs_2005/070605C.shtml</a><BR>
A remarkable proportion of the violence taking place in Iraq is regularly credited to the Jordanian Ahmad al-Khalayleh, better known as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and his organization Al Qaeda in Iraq. Sometimes it seems no car bomb goes off, no ambush occurs that isn't claimed in his name or attributed to him by the Bush administration. Bush and his top officials have, in fact, made good use of him, lifting his reputed feats of terrorism to epic, even mythic, proportions (much aided by various mainstream media outlets). Given that the invasion and occupation of Iraq has now been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to be based upon administration lies and manipulations, I had begun to wonder if the vaunted Zarqawi even existed.  (...) After discussions with our driver and other Jordanians, the only thing I feel I can say for sure is that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is a real person. Whether or not he is alive and fighting in Iraq or not, or what acts he is actually responsible for there, is open to debate. On one point, I'm quite certain, however: Reported American claims that Zarqawi has affiliations with the secular government of Syria make no sense. Just as Saddam Hussein opposed the religious fundamentalism of Osama Bin-Laden, the Syrian government would not be likely to team up with a fundamentalist like Zarqawi. As Bush administration officials have falsely claimed Saddam Hussein had links to Bin-Laden and to Zarqawi, they have also conveniently linked Zarqawi to a Syrian government they would certainly like to take out. Similarly, Bush officials continue to link Zarqawi to the Iraqi resistance -- undoubtedly another bogus claim in that the resistance in Iraq is primarily composed of Iraqi nationalists and Baathist elements who are fighting to expel the occupiers from their country, not to create a global Islamic jihad. Thus, even if Zarqawi is involved in carrying out attacks inside Iraq and is killed at some future moment, the effect this would have on the Iraqi resistance would surely be negligible. It would be but another American &quot;turning point&quot; where nothing much turne. Right now, when you try to track down Zarqawi, a man with a $25 million American bounty on his head, or simply try to track him back to the beginnings of his life's journey, whether you look for him in the tunnels of Tora Bora, the ruined city of Fallujah, the Syrian borderlands, or Ramadi, you're likely to run up against a kind of eerie blankness. Whatever the real Zarqawi may or may not be capable of doing today in Iraq or elsewhere, he is dwarfed by the Zarqawi of legend. He may be the Bush administration's Terrorist of Terrorists (now that Osama Bin-Laden has been dropped into the void), the Iraqi insurgency's unwelcome guest, the fantasy figure in some Jihadi dreamscape, or all of the above. Whatever the case, Zarqawi the man has disappeared into an epic tale that may or may not be of his own partial creation. Even dead, he is unlikely to die; even alive, he is unlikely to be able to live up to anybody's Zarqawi myth. CLIP<BR>

Israeli Human Rights Abuses and the U.S. Attack on the United Nations and the NGO Community<BR>
<a href="http://www.fpif.org/papers/PR0506law.html">http://www.fpif.org/papers/PR0506law.html</a><BR>
The Bush administration, like its predecessors, has frequently taken advantage of the idealism and values of the U.S. citizenry to justify foreign policies that most Americans would otherwise find morally unacceptable. The recent emphasis on justifying Washington&#130;s imperial goals in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East in the name of spreading liberty and democracy is a case in point. The fact that the United States is the world's principal supporter of autocratic Middle Eastern regimes is conveniently overlooked, as the administration focuses solely on the human rights abuses of governments that challenge U.S. hegemony in the region, such as Iran and Syria. Similarly, repeated emphasis of the fact that Israel has established advanced democratic institutions (at least for its Jewish citizens) and an accountable government (relative to anything that currently exists in the Arab world) makes it possible for most Americans to ignore the pattern of gross and systematic Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories. (...) Israeli violations of international humanitarian law&#151;which also include armed attacks against noncombatants&#151;are largely ignored, denied, or defended by the U.S. government. The refusal of the Bush administration and Congress to address Israeli human rights violations is so categorical that activists simply choose to apply their meager resources to more winnable causes.

Military Expands Homeland Efforts (06 July 2005)<BR>

Pentagon to share data with civilian agencies. A new Pentagon strategy for securing the U.S. homeland calls for expanded U.S. military activity not only in the air and sea -- where the armed forces have historically guarded approaches to the country -- but also on the ground and in other less traditional, potentially more problematic areas such as intelligence sharing with civilian law enforcement. The strategy is outlined in a 40-page document, approved last month, that marks the Pentagon's first attempt since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to present a comprehensive plan for defending the U.S. homeland. The document argues that a more &quot;active, layered&quot; defense is needed and says that U.S. forces must be ready to deal not just with a single terrorist strike but also with &quot;multiple, simultaneous&quot; attacks involving mass casualties. The document does not ask for new legal authority to use military forces on U.S. soil, but it raises the likelihood that U.S. combat troops will take action in the event that civilian and National Guard forces are overwhelmed. At the same time, the document stresses that primary responsibility for domestic security continues to rest with civilian agencies. &quot;The role of the military within domestic American society, both by law and by history, has been carefully constrained, and there is nothing in our strategy that would move away from that historic principle,&quot; said Paul McHale, the Pentagon's assistant secretary for homeland defense. Still, some of the provisions appear likely to draw concern from civil liberties groups that have warned against a growing military involvement in homeland missions and an erosion of long-established barriers to military surveillance and combat operations in the United States.

After Nearly 50 Days in U.S. Military Custody, Los Angeles Resident Is Still Being Held Without Charges LOS ANGELES -- The American Civil Liberties Union today filed a lawsuit against top U.S. government officials on behalf of the family of an American citizen detained indefinitely in Iraq for nearly two months without charge or access to his family or a lawyer, demanding that the man be released and returned to his home in Los Angeles. (...) &quot;What has happened to Cyrus and his family belongs in a Kafka novel,&quot; said ACLU of Southern California Legal Director Mark Rosenbaum. &quot;It is unacceptable that the U.S. military take an American and detain him indefinitely, for no reason without access to his family or to a lawyer. This administration is trashing the Constitution in the name of national security and forcing us to ask how many more people are being held unjustly like Cyrus.&quot; CLIP -Recommended by &quot;Judith Iam&quot; judeiam@cwnet.com&gt;<BR>

Cultural Revolution, American Style: Unpetroleum? (July 4, 2005)<BR>
<a href="http://culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=2">http://culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=16&Itemid=2</a><BR>
This could be America's last Fourth of July. Are you ready for system-breakdown and deep cultural change? It's true there's oil shock maximus ahead, with many obstacles to survival for a huge petro-addicted population. But don't forget that the upheaval and corrections are going to be in the context of a cultural revolution. It is not so much the exploding of poison gases and spreading toxic smoke, evocative of war, which may or may not be appropriate to everyone in a post-petroleum emerging society dealing with climate change. It is rather the concept of nation and holiday from wage-slavery that may soon be passe along with employment as we know it, if petrocollapse hits in the next year. The coming cultural revolution will feature awakening with new awareness, and part of that will be the redefining of relationships in one's more intense, immediate world. There are positive aspects to petrocollapse if it can be overcome by letting go of techno-addiction, hierarchical regimentation and destroying the ecosystem. A cultural revolution could even mean having a good time and being your higher, sensuous self, as in the 1960s revolution. Who knows? &quot;Back to the land&quot; is one thing the '60s Revolution offered, and it has been practiced down to this day. Higher consciousness was another legacy from the '60s Revolution, but it was too exclusive. This time around, after petrocollapse almost all of us will be sharing a common consciousness: trying to survive in a severely limited socioeconomic and ecological environment. There will not be car culture this time around. Very little electric power, right? And civilization will be seen as breaking down for good. Hey, I'm not causing it, so don't get mad at me. CLIP<BR>

Oil Climbs Above $60 as Tropical Storms Threaten U.S. Supply (July 6) TODAY IT WAS DOWN BY $5<BR>

(Bloomberg) -- Crude oil rose above $60 a barrel in New York after Tropical Storm Cindy disrupted shipments along the U.S. Gulf coast and another storm threatened to enter the region. Gasoline and heating oil futures rose to a record. Murphy Oil Corp. and other producers cut output in the Gulf as Cindy approached. Tropical Storm Dennis may strengthen to a hurricane today (IT HAS AND IS SO EARLY THAT IT IS A HISTORIC FIRST IN 150 YEARS!) , becoming the earliest ever to form in the Atlantic, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm may enter the Gulf in three days. Oil surged to a record last week on concern fuel supplies would be insufficient to meet demand. ''Cindy has passed but Dennis is on the way,'' said Aaron Kildow, a broker at Prudential Financial Derivatives LLC in New York. ''Dennis looks like it will be much stronger and could lock down platforms in the Gulf. It's only the first week of July and we've had four named storms, which is an awful lot.'' CLIP<BR>

Monsanto kept a study on the subject secret. A genetically modified type of corn, officially recognized in Canada the last two years, could have detrimental effects on human health. That, at least, is what emerges from a toxicological study Monsanto, the owner of the seed, conducted over the last few years. Kept secret by the biotechnology giant, this study was just recently made public through the German justice system. Added for 90 days to rats' food, MON 863 - that's the name of this genetically modified organism (GMO) - proved to be harmful to the rodents, according to the study's contents.  CLIP<BR>

Cut global warming by becoming vegetarian (July 6)<BR>

Global warming could be controlled if we all became vegetarians and stopped eating meat. That's the view of British physicist Alan Calverd, who thinks that giving up pork chops, lamb cutlets and chicken burgers would do more for the environment than burning less oil and gas.Writing in this month's Physics World, Calvert calculates that the animals we eat emit 21% of all the carbon dioxide that can be attributed to human activity. We could therefore slash man-made emissions of carbon dioxide simply by abolishing all livestock. Moreover, there would be no adverse effects to health and it would be an experiment that we could abandon at any stage. &quot;Worldwide reduction of meat production in the pursuit of the targets set in the Kyoto treaty seems to carry fewer political unknowns than cutting our consumption of fossil fuels,&quot; he says.<BR>

TARARA - At a beach resort near Havana, children with bald heads and skin lesions splash with joy in the warm Caribbean sea.They are victims of radiation fallout from the worst civilian disaster of the nuclear age -- the 1986 power plant explosion in Chernobyl -- and are in Cuba for treatment. &quot;I want to stay here,&quot; says Sveta, a blue-eyed 15-year-old from Ukraine's capital Kiev whose eyelashes are beginning to grow back.Since 1990, communist Cuba has treated free of charge 18,000 Ukrainian children for hair loss, skin disorders, cancer, leukaemia and other illnesses attributed to the radioactivity unleashed by the reactor meltdown years before they were born. (...) Havana began helping Chernobyl children when Ukraine was a Soviet republic and communist ally. The programme was maintained after Soviet communism collapsed, plunging Cuba into deep economic crisis from which it has not recovered.Cuba has never revealed the cost of the programme, which Ukrainian officials estimate at some $300 million to date.&quot;Like no other country Cuba held out a helping hand at a very difficult moment. We suffered an immense catastrophe and needed help for the most valuable thing any nation has -- its children,&quot; said Raisa Moinsenko, a Ukrainian Health Ministry official.Many of the children are orphans or come from poor families that cannot afford medical treatment in Ukraine, where public health care has deteriorated since the demise of the communist state and private medical care is expensive.The radioactive contamination from Chernobyl will take decades to break down and genetic defects among Ukrainian children are expected to continue occurring for years.

At least 1,000 women are kept in debt-bonded prostitution in Australia, where they are raped, beaten and starved, a new paper shows. The women, usually from Thailand and Burma, are brought into Australia by human traffickers who force them to work as prostitutes - often in legal brothels - for free until they pay off &quot;debts&quot; of up to $50,000. The paper, published this week by the Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault (ACSSA), reviews research and developments in trafficking in women for sexual exploitation since the early 1990s. Of the 700,000 people trafficked each year across the globe, 80 per cent are women and girls and 70 per cent of those are traded for sex, it says.  CLIP<BR>

Indonesian Court Rules Mining Companies Can Operate in Protected Forests (July 07, 2005)<BR>
<a href="http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=8174">http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=8174</a><BR>
JAKARTA, Indonesia &#151; Thirteen mining companies will be able to operate in protected forests in Indonesia after the country's highest court Thursday rejected a petition by environmental groups claiming the practice was illegal. The Constitutional Court ruled the 13 companies, which media reports said included local and foreign outfits, should be allowed to mine in the forests because they had signed contracts to do so before a 1999 law banned the practice.&quot;The sanctity of the contracts must be upheld,&quot; said the court's head Jimmy Asshiddiqie, while delivering the verdict. The immediate repercussions of the ruling were not immediately clear. The companies affected by it were not named in the verdict, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. However, environmental groups who filed the petition claimed that it would lead to further degradation of Indonesia's forests, already under threat from illegal logging, slash-and-burn agriculture and urban expansion.&quot;It is very disappointing,&quot; said Yayat Afianto, from Telepak, a prominent forestry conservation group. &quot;Allowing mining in protected forests means that they will be spoiled for ever. The only virgin forests we have left are protected ones.&quot; The government in 1999 banned mining in protected forests, which Telepak estimates account for some 8.68 million hectares (21.5 million acres) across the country. However, the government passed an emergency law in 2004 allowing companies with pre-existing contracts to resume operations.Thursday's ruling concerned the legality of that law.<BR>

Universal Festival Calendar for July, 2005<BR>
<a href="http://www.hermes3.net/july105.htm">http://www.hermes3.net/july105.htm</a><BR>
(...) Chiron in Aquarius, in particular, suggests that July 17 - 21 could be a profoundly transformative time in which major changes do occur. They are likely to be political and economic, and not just rumblings in the physical world. They are likely to give us the strange feeling of being up in the air with nothing under us, at that strange moment when we realize we must either learn to float at once, or relocate downward fast. The images of this have been on our mind screens since last year, when U. S. treasury secretary John Snow was asked what the government was going to do to arrest the sleep slide of his country's currency, and he replied that Washington was disinclined to &quot;put a floor under&quot; the dollar, which apparently is now free to hit the floor, even go through it and come to rest somewhere in the cellar or the garage, if any. Assuming, that is, that the floor is there. Michael Ventura of the Austin Chronicle, writing brilliantly as always in &quot;<a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-04-29/cols_ventura.html">$4 a Gallon Gas</a>,&quot; (on April 29), believes that &quot;America is like Wile E. Coyote after he's run out a few paces past the edge of the cliff &#150; he'll take a few more steps in midair before he looks down. Then, when he sees that there's nothing under him, he'll fall. Many Americans suspect that they're running on thin air, but they haven't looked down yet. When they do ...&quot; They may experience what someone among the ancient Egyptians expected in predicting that the year we've just been through, or are in or entering now, would be the time when &quot;the floor falls out,&quot; whatever that means. In The Great Pyramid Decoded, Peter Lemesurier claims that the key transition points among the passages in the Great Pyramid encode a master prophetic system covering all of human history. Such epochal events as the birth of Jesus, and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, fit Lemesurier's design perfectly. His reckoning may have been off in expecting that &quot;the floor falls out&quot; in 2004 -- or we may be living on rented floor space and borrowed time, just before that queasy moment when we see that the floor, whatever it is, is no longer under us. For all we know, the popular Christian fantasy of &quot;the rapture&quot; may be more prescient than we knew. Is it possible that those who'll be saved from the time of tribulation will not actually be drawn up into the air, but will seem to hover there for a moment just after the floor and everything on it has dropped away? (...) For all we know, the events of July, 2005 are here to prepare us for the Aquarian moment of total freedom and responsibility, when we are no longer flying blind, but in a field so full of light that the routes and markers we can barely see in the initial glare of ascension will resolve soon enough into the perfect map of love. Have a pleasant flight. Keep Holding That Frequency.<BR>

BREAKING: Scotland Yard says it got a warning before the attack and told Israel.<BR>
<BR>
Fox News has carried a report from AP saying that Scotland Yard had prior knowledge. Israeli News is reporting that &quot;The Israeli Embassy in London was notified in advance, resulting in Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu remaining in his hotel room rather than make his way to the hotel adjacent to the site of the first explosion, a Liverpool Street train station, where he was to address and economic summit.&quot;<BR>

Explosions In London - Who Stands To Gain?<BR>
<BR>
Prisonplanet | July 07 2005<BR>
<BR>
We have been told that the events unfolding today were &quot;inevitable&quot;, London's transport network has been hit with multiple explosions. Both the Underground and Buses have been hit. Events are still unfolding.<BR>
<BR>
<a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/Pages/033004_Stasi_London.html">We predicted this would happen over a year ago</a> after analyzing the propaganda and fear-mongering that was being ratcheted up to the extreme in London. Paul Joseph Watson has predicted these events as imminent several times on The Alex Jones Show in recent months.<BR>
<BR>
Tony Blair is not in London but safely tucked up in Scotland with 7 other World Leaders including President Bush. The political eyes of the world are on Britain this week. The Mayor of London Ken Livingstone is in Singapore where the IOC has just awarded the Olympic Games to London, he is rushing back to the city.<BR>
<BR>
Just like the events of 9/11, ask yourself, who stands to gain from this? Could this have been organized by any group other than one who has direct unlimited access to all areas of London's transport grid at all times?<BR>
<BR>
This has MI5 written all over it. Just watch that national ID card legislation sail through. Only 15% of the country supported the government after the last election, this will ensure total fealty to a smarmy Blair and whatever he wants to do. Ken Livingstone and the opposition parties will now have no grounds to reject ID card legislation, especially with the Olympics coming to London in 2012.<BR>
<BR>
The police state measures they'll get out of this will be overlaid onto all forms of transport. In fact, you won't be able to travel without the ID card. Although MI5 operations are normally more sophisticated than things like 9/11, in that the evidence linking it to the government is more carefully covered, just watch for the evidence of inside involvement to trickle out. MI5 have been caught involved in IRA bombings multiple times over.<BR>
<BR>
More to come as events unfold.<BR>

BREAKING NEWS, JULY 7TH 2005 .... TERROR ATTACKS ON LONDON - BUT BY WHOM? THOSE THE GOVERNMENTS AND MEDIA WILL BLAME ... OR THE SHADOWY FORCES CONTROLLING THOSE GOVERNMENTS AND MEDIA THAT HAVE EVERYTHING TO GAIN FROM WHAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY?<BR>
<BR>
THE WORST ACTOR IN POLITICS?<BR>
<BR>
Today we have been subjected to the puke-making sight of Tony Blair faking emotion as only he can in his endless 'statements' about the London bombings. The rehearsed pauses, the pathetic looks to the side. just as he did with the death of Diana, the promises to Afghanistan that he would not abandon them after the invasion [as he has], and when he said how hard he had tried to avoid a war with Iraq that he knew had been agreed years earlier.<BR>
<BR>
BUT KNOW THIS FAKE-EMOTION MAN. WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WHO WAS BEHIND THE LONDON BOMBINGS, JUST AS WE KNOW THAT BUSH KNEW WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR 9/11.<BR>
<BR>
THE TRUTH IS MOVING FASTER THAN YOU ARE, MR. BLAIR, AND THE DAY IS COMING WHEN IT WILL LOOK YOU IN THE EYE.<BR>
<BR>
---<BR>
<BR>
SO PREDICTABLE ....<BR>
<BR>
As I have said in the books and have said so many times in the last few months, another terror attack was inevitable with London very high on the list.<BR>
<BR>
There is an agenda to create an Orwellian global fascist state and with the blatant lies over Iraq exposed and the nightmare continuing daily in Iraq itself, the manipulators were losing momentum in the face of growing public skepticism.<BR>
<BR>
Blair is now famous for his lies and genetic inability to tell the truth about anything. Bush is losing public support in America as the people also begin to understand the scale on which they have been misled.<BR>
<BR>
Yet these two liars are front men for an agenda to impose a fascist police state that involves invading many more countries. How could they do that given their disolving credibility ... unless ...<BR>
<BR>
It was obvious that their masters would do what they always do in these situations - create a problem so they can offer the solution. They did it with 9/11, the Madrid bombing and now in London.<BR>
<BR>
And it will not be the last because these guys are simply insane and, like cornered rats, they will do anything they believe to be necessary to implement their plans - no matter what that may mean in death and suffering.<BR>

Attack On London: Blair Plays The Terror Card<BR>
<BR>
Paul Joseph Watson/Prison Planet | July 7 2005<BR>
<BR>
The attack on London represents a brutal attempt to coral the British population behind accepting the introduction of the national ID card, renewing support for the war on terror and reinvigorating trust in a government that had the backing of less than 15 per cent of the country.<BR>
<BR>
Even at this very early stage it is clear that the evidence points to inside involvement.<BR>
<BR>
The statement on a website from an unknown Al-Qaeda group claiming responsibility is exactly what we'd expect after such an event. Santa Claus could post a message saying he was responsible for the attack, does that make it so? Rupert Murdoch's Sky News are busy playing Al-Qaeda training videos with masked militants jumping through flaming hoops. The emotive propaganda is clear, these images are being linked in montages with past images of 9/11, the Bali bombing and the Madrid bombing and injured people crying in the streets.<BR>
<BR>
Even if the police and government back away from the Al-Qaeda claim, which now appears to be the case, pro-establishment Neo-Con media outlets will repeat it like an endless drumbeat until it sinks in.<BR>
<BR>
The key evidence thus far is as follows.<BR>
<BR>
Original Associated Press and Israeli radio reports stated that Binyamin Netanyahu, the former Israeli Prime Minister received a warning before the first explosion that an attack was about to take place. Scotland Yard passed on a warning to the Israeli embassy who forwarded it to Netanyahu. Netanyahu was due to make a speech at a Hotel adjacent to the site of the first blast. He cancelled the speech and remained in his hotel room.<BR>
<BR>
Arutz Sheva sourced Army Radio with the following.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Israeli Embassy in London was notified in advance, resulting in Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu remaining in his hotel room rather than make his way to the hotel adjacent to the site of the first explosion, a Liverpool Street train station, where he was to address and economic summit.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For an hour after the first blast, the government and the news media were reporting that the cause was an electrical power surge. If the government knew bombs were going to go off before they did, why did they report for an hour that it was an accident? Were they trying to bide time so they could get their story straight?<BR>
<BR>
Both Scotland Yard and the Israelis have since denied that they had any foreknowledge of the attack.<BR>
<BR>
Since the original report, major TV news networks have been completely silent on the Netanyahu story. They are just repeating claims that there was no prior knowledge.<BR>
<BR>
About an hour after the story broke, Associated Press started altering their online news stories, stating that Netanyahu got the warning after the first blast and not before. It seems as if they are scrambling to co-ordinate their cover story. Either there were no warnings or the warning was after the first blast. The dithering seems to suggest there is some confusion on how to successfully hide the smoking gun, the fact that Netanyahu was warned before the first explosion.<BR>
<BR>
Why didn't the people on the trains and buses get the same warning?<BR>
<BR>
On June 7th, MI5 downgraded the London terror alert from its second highest level &quot;severe general&quot; to a lower category of &quot;substantial&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Why did they do this, was somebody lowering the guard?<BR>
<BR>
The timing of the attack is very suspicious, coming on the heels of the start of the G8 conference. Both Tony Blair and George Bush in their speeches have tried to paint the attack as an assault on globalization and the G8 itself. This means that if you're against the G8 and globalization, then you're with the terrorists! It's a tried and tested method they've used time and time before.<BR>
 <BR>
In any crime you look at history and motive, The British government has been caught in multiple examples of carrying out bombings in London which were then blamed on the IRA. They even had one of their own MI5 agents wihin the Omagh bomb squad. Click here for an archive of this evidence.<BR>
<BR>
The British government has also been caught scripting fake terror alerts for political effect. Days before the Queen's speech notable November speech in which she first introduced ID card legislation, ITN news correspondents and government lobbyists got together to cook up a fake terror alert involving planes attacking Canary Wharf. A London Independent article later exposed this as a crass psy-op campaign to get the British people behind the ID card.<BR>
<BR>
From Putin blowing up his own apartment buildings to Israel being behind Hamas, the evidence is consistently clear that large scale terrorism is always state sponsored.<BR>
<BR>
The Madrid train bombing is another example. The bombers were found to be police informants with close links to the Spanish security services. They had access to the most secure areas of the Madrid train system. The Spanish government initially tried to blaim the Basque group ETA for the blast in the hope that the people would rally behind the government and get them re-elected. After ETA denied involvement and the people started saying the government was involved, the Spanish government had to blame Al-Qaeda and kill some patsies by claiming they blew themselves up during a raid.<BR>
<BR>
The wider agenda will become clearer when Blair firmly points the finger at the selected patsies designated to take the fall. But for the moment he's happy to grandstand as the courageous leader who immediately returned to London to take control of the chaos.<BR>
<BR>
BBC polls that were showing 80 per cent plus opposed the ID card will now likely flip back in the opposite direction. Support for the European Union and increased globalization through the G8 will rise. Who stands to gain from all this? Who has the motive?<BR>
<BR>
We will continue to track developments as they occur and keep our readers posted.<BR>

Subject: Inner World results of Live 8<BR>
Date: 7 Jul 2005<BR>
 <BR>
Dear Jean,<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for all that you do and specifically at this time for the e-mail from William Bloom. The Live 8 event on Saturday, billed as 'The Biggest Spiritual Event Ever', lived up to expectations on an inner level. I held an open house at my home, and one friend drove 50 miles to be there, hearing the message that 'it would start when she arrived'. I read aloud William Bloom's e-mail 'The Biggest Spiritual Event Ever' and added&nbsp;the following comments:&nbsp;When the collective consciousness of humanity is focused&nbsp;together in a positive way it&nbsp;forms a vessel to receive&nbsp;the vast amounts of love and light needed on our planet to manifest Heaven on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, when enough of us are thinking, feeling&nbsp;and vibrating at the same level we can shift the collective consciousness of humanity.&nbsp;<BR>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
The energy in the room was very tangible. Shortly thereafter, my friend had a profound experience. I saw&nbsp;her lurch out of her seat and collapse on the floor in an adjacent room. She felt 'plastered' to the floor and could not move. I straightened her legs and placed a cushion under her knees. We prayed for whatever was unfolding to do so with ease and grace. She experienced herself as her Golden Angel holding court with all the Golden Angels from across the Universe who were brought together in union&nbsp;in response to&nbsp;our Live 8 gathering, and they realized their Oneness. She felt very blessed, very joyful and full of grace. Tears pooled in her eyes - tears of Oneness. Her Angel spoke softly through her about the openings, the love, joy and grace, and the shift that was coming. Then there was an announcement that the great shift in consciousness had happened and that&nbsp;the Oneness has begun. This is where we have been heading through all&nbsp;the years of global meditations!!<BR>
<BR>
My friend&nbsp;slowly returned to normal consciousness and it took awhile before she could move normally again. After the concert in London ended, we held hands in a circle and did a global healing meditation and the Tikkun Olam Meditation (a monthly meditation&nbsp;I have been guided to do since 1998&nbsp;in which we&nbsp;experience all the boundaries and separations within us, between us, between humanity and the Earth, and between Heaven and Earth dissolving back into the nothingness from which they came).  Let us keep up the momentum with the suggested Global G8 Summit Meditation, your continuing Meditation Focus and the new special Light Vigil Meditation.<BR>
 <BR>
May we, and 'All That Is' be abundantly blessed at we anchor and manifest the Oneness.<BR>
<BR>
Blessings, Love & Light,<BR>

ANOTHER USEFUL PERSPECTIVE TO CONSIDER ON LIVE8<BR>
<BR>
From: &quot;Mary Devlin&quot; marydevlin99@hotmail.com&gt;<BR>
Subject: Live8 comment<BR>

<BR>
Dear Jean,<BR>
<BR>
I usually don't do this sort of thing. I feel that people are entitled to their own opinions, and everyone out there is intelligent enough to make up their own minds about anything.<BR>
<BR>
But I feel I must comment on the diatribe against Live 8 by Patty-Lynne Herlevi. She seems to be well-intentioned. I believe, however, that she isn't taking a good long look at the facts.<BR>
<BR>
First of all, she is mistaken in her implication that all the big name performers are motivated solely by ego and the desire for publicity. Yes, they must have big egos or they wouldn't be where they are. But people are complex; very few if any totally conform to one or more of the many stereotypes floating around in the collective unconscious. Pop musicians with big egos can also care about the welfare of others less fortunate than themselves; that quality is not limited to the shyer and more reticent among us. I don't know the gentleman, but I find it hard to believe that Bob Geldof would have spent so much of his own time and funds over the past 20 years working towards eradicating poverty if he didn't care. If all he wanted was publicity, he could do a TV commercial for NIKE and probably get a lot more than he would have from Live8.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, these people don't need the publicity. Do you really think that Madonna's career depends on her doing a song in a Live 8 concert? All she would have to do to make headlines all over the world would be to take off her clothes in public. But making music, creating songs and arranging them, finding  other musicians to work with, getting costumes together, not to mention all the travel involved, is work.  Lots of it!  AND it costs a lot of money. Again, there are much cheaper ways to get publicity than to go to all the trouble to put together a show, even if it's only one number, and to have to rest for three days afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
I know. I am one of those lesser-known musicians that Ms. Herlevi mentions. I do medieval and Renaissance music, so I don't use all the technological wonders that modern pop music requires. My group uses polyphonica a capella singing and acoustic instruments to perform what we do - and so we don't need roadies to haul around the amps and the keyboards and the sound boards. Yet after a concert we're all still exhausted and have to rest for two days. I have two sons who have been in lesser-known musical pop groups, and they have also been wiped out for days after a concert.<BR>
<BR>
Musicians, again, even lesser-known ones like myself and my sons, must have big egos or they wouldn't even try to make it in the music business. It is a wonderful business, yet it can be exhausting - and we're all often at the mercy of nasty reviewers and others who would stand in our way. Our big egos get a lot of bruising, I'll tell you!<BR>
<BR>
Wouldn't I love it if the promoters of such shows as Live8 actually wanted lesser known musicians! I would have been up on stage with all of them in a moment if they had asked me! I'm sure my sons would have done so, too - and we would have willingly done all the work, taken the time, spent the money, to give the best show we possibly could. But the promoters didn't ask us - because, frankly, it wouldn't have gotten the message out. Do you think that people all over the world who had never heard of us would have walked across the room to turn on their TVs to see ME? As much as I'd like to think so, I know the answer to that is NO. And though I agree that it's a travesty that such bands are vastly ignored by the music industry, the same probably goes for native African groups as well. I feel that a few of them should have been included, definitely. But if Live 8 had been populated totally by lesser-known musicians, very few people across the globe would have tuned in. And the important thing was to get the message out. Yes, it would be nice if some of us had been included. But we don't have the resources to do it. (Yet!)<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, if publicity is to be an issue, it's far more likely that the lesser-known musicians would be doing it for the publicity. We need it - while the major pop groups do not!<BR>
<BR>
Ms. Herlevi mentions that some of the performers will be doing Gregorian chants, and asks who. I assume she meant to point out that it probably wasn't the original monks who recorded the album CHANT. But it doesn't matter. As a medieval musician, I am a student of Gregorian chant, and the metaphysical effects of this wonderful genre were programmed into it way back in the 7th century, when Pope Gregory IX was commissioning the composition. There are rules governing pitches and intervals that create the uplifting effect that such chant projects. So if the singer performs this Chant in the right way, it doesn't matter who does it. What matters is that it is heard.<BR>
<BR>
It may boost one's ego to believe that one is more caring and humanitarian than all those dreadful self-centered, egotistical, publicity-grabbing monsters up there pretending to care about Africa. But the situation is far more complex than that. These people probably do care, very much - some more than others, of course, but they do care.  And even if they didn't, what's more important is to make the man on the street care. Most people do have humanitarian instincts. But too many of us now, caught up in the uncertainties and worries of a weak and lagging economy, are more concerned with making our next mortgage payment than anything else. It's a survival mechanism, yes, but it does cloud the issue of how others in the world are suffering far more than people who have trouble making their bills every month.<BR>
<BR>
Yet when attention is called to such matters, people suddenly find that they care. Some can afford to contribute monetarily. Others can't, but can take action such as volunteering or writing to their legislators. Even if all one can afford to do is buy a $1.98 bumper sticker for their car, at least that in some small way serves to get the word out. If it takes self-centered, egotistical, uncaring monsters to move that cause along, well, that may be a sad commentary on human society, but at least they're doing something. That's a very pragmatic attitude, I know, but let's face it: We don't live in the best of all possible worlds. We can only try to make it that way. And it takes effort - no matter how motivated. For what it's worth, that's my (very) humble opinion.<BR>
<BR>
As for globalization? I admit I don't know much about economics. Maybe Live 8  is just another form of globalization. But, at least for now, if it wakes people up, so be it.<BR>
<BR>

Subject: LIVE8 - THE smallEST SPIRITUAL EVENT EVER<BR>
<BR>
I don't think this event being spiritual or nothing else but a great opportunity for artists to get &quot;global recognition&quot; without spending a penny.<BR>
<BR>
With exception of Pete Sieger, Arlo Gintrie, Mercedes Soza, Victor Jara to name a few, these artists are not willing to put their money and the time and work that it takes to really deal with the causes of european made poverty in Africa. I remember being in Germany during the Rwanda conflict. There was a report on how Belgium and France were supporting different sides of the conflict with weapons and money.<BR>
<BR>
And as you travel throughout the real stories behind the African fabricated poverty you find:<BR>
<BR>
1 - resources is at stake<BR>
2 - population control is at stake<BR>
3 - access to cleaner environment is at stake<BR>
4 - biological, diversity is at stake<BR>
<BR>
just to name a few, again.<BR>
<BR>
So it turns my stomach to see this people again making another concert to promote themselves at the cost of Africa.<BR>
<BR>
Please refrain from thinking that we Africans cannot see what the circus is all about.<BR>
<BR>
All the money that will be generated by selling CD's, tapes and media with the songs of the different artists, will create incredible hazardous wastes, which will end up somewhere dumped on Africa or in Asian. Europe is driving the hazardous waste dump scheme and so is the USA, as a means to create an industry in the African continent.<BR>
<BR>
If these artists were really interested, they would get rid of their cell phone, which needs coltan (which comes from Congo). Coltan is one of the minerals that has create and fed the war in the Congo. Well you get the idea. If these artists were really interested, they would:<BR>
<BR>
1 - stop consuming<BR>
2 - get rid of their cell phones<BR>
3 - get involved in braking the cicle of &quot;shop until you drop.&quot;<BR>
4 - Become a stuard of community education and simple lifestyle like Pete Sieger, Holy Sklar, Ferron, Cat Steven.<BR>
5 - Bono is a friend of Paul martin. Bono was in Davos. It speaks loud and clear whose sides he is on. This is all theatrics.<BR>
<BR>
Another false start. Another illusion<BR>
<BR>
Everybody is in denial.<BR>

Live 8: Corporate Media Bonanza<BR>
Disinformation Campaign and Public Relations Stunt on behalf of the G8<BR>
<BR>
by Michel Chossudovsky<BR>
<BR>
July 5, 2005<BR>
<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca">http://www.globalresearch.ca</a><BR>
<BR>
Live 8, &quot;the greatest concert&quot; ever aired live, has been presented to World public opinion as an &quot;awareness campaign&quot; in solidarity with Africa. Its stated objective was to put pressure on the Group of Eight leaders (G8) to increase foreign aid flows and cancel the debt of the World's poorest countries.<BR>
<BR>
In the words of its promoter Bob Geldof, Live 8 has provided a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; to save a continent from a humanitarian disaster.<BR>
<BR>
The Live 8 concerts organized in the eight major industrial countries (as well as in South Africa), however, were not intended to raise money for the World's poorest countries.<BR>
<BR>
In fact quite the opposite.<BR>
<BR>
Live 8 is a multimillion dollar undertaking, which will result in huge profits for its corporate sponsors including AOL Time Warner, the US based media giant, the Ford Motor company, through its Swedish affiliate Volvo and Nokia, the cell phone company, not to mention Britain's EMI Music Group, which has entered into a highly lucrative arrangement with the Live 8 organizers.<BR>
<BR>
AOLTime Warner controls the US broadcasting rights which it has licenced to the Walt Disney Company for broadcast TV on ABC and a myriad of affiliated TV and radio stations, including Premiere Radio Networks, XM Satellite Radio and Viacom's MTV Networks (for cable TV). AOL also holds the exclusive online rights for the event on the internet.<BR>
<BR>
TV air-time has been auctioned off around the world. Millions of dollars of advertising revenues are expected from the broadcasting of the event, not to mention the repeats, the video-clips, the internet broadcasting and the DVDs, which will be available commercially.<BR>
<BR>
According to the producers, Live 8 will go down as &quot;the biggest global broadcast in history&quot;. The organizers expect(ed) --through TV, radio and the internet-- to reach some 5.5 billion people, or 85 per cent of the world's population. The advertising industry places the number of potential viewers at a conservative two billion, approximately one third of the World's population.<BR>
<BR>
By far this is largest media advertising operation in history, which will line the pockets of the promoters, producers, corporate sponsors, not to mention the royalties accruing to the performers and &quot;celebrities&quot;. A small percentage of the proceeds might accrue to charitable organizations involved in developing countries but this is not the stated objective of Live 8.<BR>
<BR>
The Ford Motor Company has used the event to promote its &quot;up-market&quot; Swedish car division Volvo, with advertising spots during the US broadcast.<BR>
<BR>
Volvo has also provided for artist transportation to and from the London and Philadelphia concerts as well as a VIP entertainment suite at the Philadelphia concert. (See <a href="http://www.adage.com/news">http://www.adage.com/news</a>, June 30, 2005).<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The event, said company spokesman Soren Johansson, &quot;fits with the DNA of the company&quot; and &quot;appeals to peoples emotions.&quot; One of Volvo's TV spots features 'Volvo for Life&quot; award-winner Rosamond Carr, &quot;who operates an orphanage in Rwanda, and two others talking about Volvos values and their reasons for Live 8 involvement.&quot; (Ibid)<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Vonage, the US based phone company is said to have spent &quot;'six figures' to become a primary sponsor of Premiere Radio Networkscoverage&quot;. And will also run a Live 8 schedule on MTV Networks.<BR>
<BR>
The EMI Deal<BR>
<BR>
In a multimillion dollar agreement with the Live 8 organizers, Britain's EMI Music Group has secured the exclusive rights on the DVDs of the concerts in six of the G8 countries including the US, France, Britain, UK, Italy and Germany:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;An EMI spokeswoman said that once sales had paid for the advance, Live 8 would pay a 'very generous royalty rate' to Live 8 on the rest of the sales.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the words, of Bob Geldof, &quot;I hope this will be the biggest-selling DVD of all time.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the event has contributed to boosting stock market values with EMI's share price triple its 2003 level.<BR>
<BR>
Distorting the Causes of Global Poverty<BR>
<BR>
The concerts are totally devoid of political content. They concentrate on simple and misleading clich&eacute;s.<BR>
<BR>
They use poverty as a marketing tool and a consumer-advertising gimmick to increase the number of viewers and listeners worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
Live 8 creates an aura of optimism. It conveys the impression that poverty can be vanquished with the stroke of the pen. All we need is good will. The message is that G8 leaders, together with the World Bank and the IMF, are ultimately committed to poverty alleviation.<BR>
<BR>
In this regard, the concerts are part of the broader process of media disinformation. They are used as a timely public relations stunt for Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is hosting the G-8 Summit at Gleneagles, Scotland. Tony Blair is presented as stepping up his campaign to convince other G8 nations &quot;to take action on poverty&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The G8's Debt Forgiveness Proposal<BR>
<BR>
Live 8 fails to challenge or comprehend the G8 policy agenda which directly contributes to creating poverty, nor does it question the role of the World Bank, now under the helm of Paul Wolfowitz, the neo-conservative architect of the invasion of Iraq,<BR>
<BR>
In addressing the issue of debt forgiveness, Live 8 does not even acknowledge the impacts of  IMF-World Bank &quot;economic medicine&quot; imposed on the World's poorest countries on behalf of Western creditors.<BR>
<BR>
These deadly macro-economic reforms have contributed to the impoverishment of millions of people. They oblige countries to close down their schools and hospitals, privatize their public services and sell off the most profitable sectors of their national economy to foreign capital. In return, the G8 promises to increase foreign aid and provide token debt relief. These reforms kill and the G8 is not the solution but the cause. Actor Will Smith addressed the crowds at the concert venues &quot;to snap their fingers&quot; as a reminder that every three seconds a child dies in Africa. What he failed to mention is that the main cause of child mortality in Africa are the deadly macroeconomic reforms.<BR>
<BR>
Bob Geldof sees an increase in foreign aid completely out of context, as a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; to eradicating poverty, when in fact the proposed increase in aid flows by the rich G8 countries will lead to exactly the opposite results.<BR>
<BR>
A large percentage of the debt of these countries is owed to the World Bank, the IMF and the African Development Bank<BR>
<BR>
To address this issue, G8 finance ministers had indeed put forth a proposal which consisted in &quot;foregiving&quot; the outstanding debt owed to these three international financial institutions by the 18 highly indebted countries. The debt forgiveness figure mentioned was of the order of 40 billion dollars. Concurrently, there was a vague commitment to eventually increasing foreign aid flows to the 0.7% of GDP target. (<a href="http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm050611_dev.htm">http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm050611_dev.htm</a>)<BR>
<BR>
Where is the hitch behind this seemingly reasonable &quot;debt forgiveness&quot; proposal?<BR>
<BR>
The IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Bank, never cancel or forgive outstanding debts.<BR>
<BR>
Because they do not forgive debts, the G8 has committed itself to reimbursing the multilateral creditors acting on behalf of the World's poorest countries.<BR>
<BR>
Where will they get the money?<BR>
<BR>
For each dollar of &quot;debt cancellation&quot; to the international financial institutions, the G8 will reduce the flow of foreign aid to these countries. In other words, the foreign aid earmarked to finance much needed social programs will now go directly into the coffers of the IMF and the World Bank.<BR>
<BR>
There is nothing new in this financial mechanism. It has been used time and again since the onslaught of the debt crisis.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Social Safety Net&quot; for the IMF and the World Bank<BR>
<BR>
What we are dealing with is not a debt forgiveness program, but a &quot;reimbursement&quot; process which directly serves the interests of the creditors.<BR>
<BR>
The deal constitutes a much needed &quot;social safety net&quot; for the multilateral creditors. It ensures a cash flow towards these institutions, while maintaining the World's poorest countries in the stranglehold of the IMF and the World Bank. It also prevents these countries from declaring default on their external debt.<BR>
<BR>
President Bush has made it very clear. The money paid to the World Bank on behalf of the countries, will be &quot;taken out of existing aid budgets.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;debt forgiveness&quot; program, even if it is accompanied by an increase in foreign aid commitments, will result in a significant compression of real foreign aid flows to the highly indebted countries.<BR>
<BR>
The proposed increases in foreign aid commitments are fictitious since the money is intended for the multilateral creditors. And the deal will only be implemented if the indebted countries promise to carry out the usual gamut of &quot;free market&quot; reforms, under IMF/World Bank supervision.<BR>
<BR>
An added condition emanating directly from the Bush administration pertains to &quot;governance&quot;. It requires these countries to &quot;democratize&quot; on the US model under Western supervision, as well as carry out &quot;free elections&quot; on the example of Iraq and Afghanistan.<BR>
<BR>
Concluding Remarks<BR>
<BR>
The concerts serve to usefully distract public attention from the US-UK led war on Iraq and the broader relationship between war and global poverty. Not a word is mentioned in the concerts on the fact that George W. Bush and Tony Blair are considered &quot;war criminals&quot; under international law.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Live 8 tends to undermine all forms of meaningful and articulate dissent to the G8 policy agenda. With the exception of the South African venue, which included the appearance of Nelson Mandela, the concerts are devoid of a broader understanding and commitment.<BR>
<BR>
Live 8 undermines both the anti-globalization and anti-war movements. It diverts public opinion and distracts media attention from the G8 protest movement. It also serves to undermine the articulation of more radical voices against the New World Order.<BR>
<BR>
More generally, the event instills an atmosphere of ignorance among the millions who listen to the music and who have the feeling of doing something positive and constructive. But none of the core elements needed to understand the causes of global poverty are presented.<BR>
<BR>
To the Live 8 corporate sponsors, including Bob Geldof, the EMI Group, AOL Time Warner, The Ford Motor Company, Nokia, MTV, the Walt Disney Company, etc. &quot;Put your money where you mouth is.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
If you are really committed to poverty alleviation, give the entire proceeds of this multimillion dollar media operation, including the revenues generated by the corporate sponsors, TV networks, advertising firms, royalties accruing to celebrities and performers, to the people of Africa. Let them use this money as they see fit, without interference from donors and creditors.<BR>
<BR>
To the people of Africa. Do not let yourself be deceived by a giant corporate media stunt where poverty is used as a logo, to attract consumers and make money. Default on your debt to the IMF and the World Bank.&nbsp;<BR>

A TRUCKLOAD OF NONSENSE<BR>
<BR>
By George Monbiot<BR>
<BR>
The G8 plan to save Africa comes with conditions that make it little more than an extortion racket<BR>
<BR>
June 14, 2005<BR>
<BR>
An aura of sanctity is descending upon the world's most powerful men. On Saturday the finance ministers from seven of the G8 nations (Russia was not invited) promised to cancel the debts the poorest countries owe to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The hand that holds the sword has been stayed by angels: angels with guitars rather than harps. Who, apart from the leader writers of the Daily Telegraph, could deny that debt relief is a good thing? Never mind that much of this debt - money lent by the World Bank and IMF to corrupt dictators - should never have been pursued in the first place. Never mind that, in terms of looted resources, stolen labour and now the damage caused by climate change, the rich owe the poor far more than the poor owe the rich. Some of the poorest countries have been paying more for debt than for health or education. Whatever the origins of the problem, that is obscene.<BR>
<BR>
You are waiting for me to say but, and I will not disappoint you. The but comes in paragraph 2 of the finance ministers' statement. To qualify for debt relief, developing countries must &quot;tackle corruption, boost private-sector development&quot; and eliminate &quot;impediments to private investment, both domestic and foreign&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
These are called conditionalities. Conditionalities are the policies governments must follow before they receive aid and loans and debt relief. At first sight they look like a good idea. Corruption cripples poor nations, especially in Africa. The money which could have given everyone a reasonable standard of living has instead made a handful unbelievably rich. The powerful nations are justified in seeking to discourage it.<BR>
<BR>
That's the theory. In truth, corruption has seldom been a barrier to foreign aid and loans: look at the money we have given, directly and through the World Bank and IMF, to Mobutu, Suharto, Marcos, Moi and every other premier-league crook. Robert Mugabe, the west's demon king, has deservedly been frozen out by the rich nations. But he has caused less suffering and is responsible for less corruption than Rwanda's Paul Kagame or Uganda's Yoweri Museveni, both of whom are repeatedly cited by the G8 countries as practitioners of &quot;good governance&quot;. Their armies, as the UN has shown, are largely responsible for the meltdown in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which has so far claimed 4 million lives, and have walked off with billions of dollars' worth of natural resources. Yet Britain, which is hosting the G8 summit, remains their main bilateral funder. It has so far refused to make their withdrawal from the DRC a conditionality for foreign aid.<BR>
<BR>
The difference, of course, is that Mugabe has not confined his attacks to black people; he has also dispossessed white farmers and confiscated foreign assets. Kagame, on the other hand, has eagerly supplied us with the materials we need for our mobile phones and computers: materials that his troops have stolen from the DRC. &quot;Corrupt&quot; is often used by our governments and newspapers to mean regimes that won't do what they're told.<BR>
<BR>
Genuine corruption, on the other hand, is tolerated and even encouraged. Twenty-five countries have so far ratified the UN convention against corruption, but none is a member of the G8. Why? Because our own corporations do very nicely out of it. In the UK companies can legally bribe the governments of Africa if they operate through our (profoundly corrupt) tax haven of Jersey. Lord Falconer, the minister responsible for sorting this out, refuses to act. When you see the list of the island's clients, many of which sit in the FTSE 100 index, you begin to understand.<BR>
<BR>
The idea, swallowed by most commentators, that the conditions our governments impose help to prevent corruption is laughable. To qualify for World Bank funding, our model client Uganda was forced to privatise most of its state-owned companies before it had any means of regulating their sale. A sell-off that should have raised $500m for the Ugandan exchequer instead raised $2m. The rest was nicked by government officials. Unchastened, the World Bank insisted that - to qualify for the debt-relief programme the G8 has now extended - the Ugandan government sell off its water supplies, agricultural services and commercial bank, again with minimal regulation.<BR>
<BR>
And here we meet the real problem with the G8's conditionalities. They do not stop at pretending to prevent corruption, but intrude into every aspect of sovereign government. When the finance ministers say &quot;good governance&quot; and &quot;eliminating impediments to private investment&quot;, what they mean is commercialisation, privatisation and the liberalisation of trade and capital flows. And what this means is new opportunities for western money.<BR>
<BR>
Let's stick for a moment with Uganda. In the late 80s, the IMF and World Bank forced it to impose &quot;user fees&quot; for basic healthcare and primary education. The purpose appears to have been to create new markets for private capital. School attendance, especially for girls, collapsed. So did health services, particularly for the rural poor. To stave off a possible revolution, Museveni reinstated free primary education in 1997 and free basic healthcare in 2001. Enrolment in primary school leapt from 2.5 million to 6 million, and the number of outpatients almost doubled. The World Bank and the IMF - which the G8 nations control - were furious. At the donors' meeting in April 2001, the head of the bank's delegation made it clear that, as a result of the change in policy, he now saw the health ministry as a &quot;bad investment&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
There is an obvious conflict of interest in this relationship. The G8 governments claim they want to help poor countries develop and compete successfully. But they have a powerful commercial incentive to ensure that they compete unsuccessfully, and that our companies can grab their public services and obtain their commodities at rock-bottom prices. The conditionalities we impose on the poor nations keep them on a short leash.<BR>
<BR>
That's not the only conflict. The G8 finance ministers' statement insists that the World Bank and IMF will monitor the indebted countries' progress, and decide whether they are fit to be relieved of their burden. The World Bank and IMF, of course, are the agencies which have the most to lose from this redemption. They have a vested interest in ensuring that debt relief takes place as slowly as possible.<BR>
<BR>
Attaching conditions like these to aid is bad enough. It amounts to saying: &quot;We will give you a trickle of money if you give us the crown jewels.&quot; Attaching them to debt relief is in a different moral league: &quot;We will stop punching you in the face if you give us the crown jewels.&quot; The G8's plan for saving Africa is little better than an extortion racket.<BR>
<BR>
Do you still believe our newly sanctified leaders have earned their haloes? If so, you have swallowed a truckload of nonsense. Yes, they should cancel the debt. But they should cancel it unconditionally.<BR>

<BR>
&quot;When you have this rich minority in a position of absolute control over the institutions of global governance, like the World Bank or the I.M.F., the U.S. being allowed to appoint the president of an international institution like the World Bank, the Europeans have their pick in appointing the president of the I.M.F. Then you understand that we live in political economy of essentially global apartheid, international minority rule, where this tiny minority of rich states are dictating economic rules, political rules that the rest of the world must follow if it's going to have access essentially to financing for development.&quot;<BR>

Jubilee campaigns and debt cancellation advocates can be proud of their efforts. The Finance Ministers of the eight rich country governments as represented at the Group of 8 (G-8) have announced a deal on 100% debt cancellation of International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and African Development Fund debt for some impoverished nations.But much more work remains to be done to achieve the full Jubilee vision of debt cancellation for all impoverished countries and countries in crisis, without harmful economic conditions.<BR>

Live 8 Concerts Beat The Drum For What?Jon Rappoport (July 4 2005)<BR>
<a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/july2005/040705beatthedrum.htm">http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/july2005/040705beatthedrum.htm</a><BR>
Behind the Live 8 hysteria taking place as we speak, there is an agenda, and it has nothing to do what forcing the so-called wealthy G8 nations to eliminate poverty in Africa.The G8 already has a plan. The concerts are merely the cover to make it seem that these G8 power players are caving in to pressure. Here is the real agenda:Flood Africa with highly toxic AIDS drugs. Forgive African debt to the World Bank, the Paris Club, IMF, and other creditors. This is debt, by the way, that would never be repaid anyway. Under the guise of debt cancellation, impose IMF-type rules on the affairs of these African nations. This means that outside predatory capital can freely move in and buy up (more of) the utilities, resources, cheap labor, and land in many parts of Africa. These repressive rules would ordinarily be imposed by approaching African debtor nations and saying, &quot;We'll continue to lend you $$ so you can repay at least the interest on the loans you can't repay. But now you have play by our regulations.&quot; But why bother with that charade? Why not just retire the debt and impose the same rules? On the AIDS front, the drugs will maim and kill off many Africans. This will be called &quot;poverty assistance.&quot; Of course, poverty, contaminated water supplies, hunger, stolen agricultural lands---none of this will be eliminated. In fact, these factors will continue to be called AIDS. It's not hard to use rock and roll stars as dupes and cutouts. All you have to do is make them think they're the people who are applying the pressure. They already think they know what AIDS is, and they already believe that killer drugs are the solution. They fit in nicely.<BR>

Live8 is an NWO Psyop - so is AIDS ( July 02, 2005) <a href="http://wagnews.blogspot.com/2005/07/live8-is-nwo-psyop-so-is-aids.html">http://wagnews.blogspot.com/2005/07/live8-is-nwo-psyop-so-is-aids.html</a><BR>
Live8. There hasn't been anything like it since... well since the last Pharma-inspired major world PsyOp: the so-called SARS epidemic which 'raged' at exactly the time the U.S. wanted to turn eyes away from Iraq -and yet maintain the elevated sense of threat which the Iraq invasion had created. Pharma's interests and those of the G8 New World Order are as one, needless to say. Populations who perceive themselves as under threat are more right-wing in their political and social expression. And they are more likely to run to Big Pharma if they think they are in a health emergency. Which is why these PsyOps are ruthlessly deployed to set the tone of public attitude -with a lot of help from Big Media. The attitude to Africa which Pharma want us to have is that is should be seen as a disease-ridden continent in desperate need of the taxpayer-funded AIDS drugs -which will boost the coffers and failing reputation of the pharmaceutical industry. Which is timely, as Pharma prepares to squelch alternative health approaches with it's imminent global Codex and dietary supplements protocols. The attitude to Africa which the G8 want us to have is that it should be seen as a failing continent in need of a swift neocolonial power-grab by the G8 to rescue it from the maw of both AIDS and poverty. [See: <a href="http://www.breakfornews.com/G8-World-Order.htm">Dawn of the G8 New World Order</a>] The sop to our conscience will be the so-called debt relief package. The G8 will allow itself to be 'forced' to drop the debt by heroic campaigners like the mega-wealthy Bono and businessman, Sir Bob Geldof. Useful idiots with far more money than geopolitical savvy.

Subject: Mother Who Lost Son in Iraq Talks About &quot;Disgusting&quot; Meeting With Bush<BR>
Date: 7 Jul 2005<BR>
<BR>
I heard Cindy describing all this on Pacifica a couple weeks ago and the way I remember her description of the incident with the daughter was Bush said something like &quot;it must be terrible losing a loved one, I wish we could bring him back&quot; and the daughter said &quot;well yeah&quot; in that sort of way a teenager might also use the expression &quot;you think?&quot;  It was then that Bush gave her a really filthy look and walked away.&nbsp;<BR>

Mom, Who Lost Son In Iraq, Talks About 'Disgusting' White House Private Meeting With Bush<BR>
<BR>
Posted on: 7/5/2005 9:21:00 AM - Columnist By Greg Szymanski<BR>
<BR>
Cindy Sheehan has already had her heart ripped into a million pieces by the illegal Iraqi war, losing the son she loved more than life itself only five days after he arrived in Baghdad&nbsp;on April 4,&nbsp;2004.<BR>
<BR>
So when Sheehan received an invitation to meet privately with President Bush at the White House two months after her son died, the least she could have expected was a bit of compassion or a kind word coming from the heart.<BR>
<BR>
But what she encountered was an arrogant man with eyes lacking the slightest bit of compassion, a President totally &quot;detached from humanity&quot; and a man who didn't even bother to remember her son's name when they were first introduced.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of a kind gesture or a warm handshake, Sheehan said she immediately got a taste of Bush arrogance when he entered the room and &quot;in a condescending tone and with a disgusting loud Texas accent,&quot; said: &quot;Who we&#130;all honorin&#130; here today?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;His mouth kept moving, but there was nothing in his eyes or anything else about him that showed me he really cared or had any real compassion at all. This is a human being totally disconnected from humanity and reality. His eyes were empty, hollow shells and he was acting like I should be proud to just be in his presence when it was my son who died for his illegal war! It was one of the most disgusting experiences I ever had and it took me almost a year to even talk about it,&quot; said Sheehan in a telephone conversation from Washington D.C. where she was attending a July 4th anti-war rally.<BR>
<BR>
Sheehan said the June 2004 private meeting with the President went from bad to worse to a nightmare when Bush acted like he didn't even want to know her name. She said Bush kept referring to her as &quot;Ma&#130; or &quot;Mom&#130; while he &quot;put on a phony act,&quot; saying things like &quot;Mom, I can't even imagine losing a loved one, a mother or a father or a sister or a brother.&#130;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The whole meeting was simply bizarre and disgusting, designed to intimidate instead of providing compassion. He didn't even know our names,&quot; said Sheehan. &quot;Finally I got so upset I just looked him in the eye, saying &quot;I think you can imagine losing someone. You have two daughters. Imagine losing them?&#130; After I said that he just looked at me, looked at me with no feeling or caring in his eyes at all.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sheehan said what really upset her about the meeting is that Bush appeared to become annoyed and even angry at her daughter Carley, 25, who also attended the White House get-together.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My daughter said to him directly &quot;I wish I could bring my loved one back&#130; and he said something like &quot;so do we.&#130; Later she told me that after he made his remark he gave her one of the filthiest looks she had ever had gotten in her life.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I just couldn't believe this was happening. It was so surreal and bizarre. Later I met with some of the other 15 or 16 families who were at the White House the same day and, sure enough, they all felt the same way I did.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's interesting that they put us each in separate rooms. I heard this was done to prevent any type of group outburst and since it's easier to control a situation when people are separated. Looking back, all I can say is that the meeting with Bush was one of the most disgusting experiences in my life.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And I even asked him: &quot;Why did you even bother to bring us here when I didn't vote for you and don't support the illegal nature of your war?&#130; He said it wasn't political but I know it was just another one of his lies, as he probably wanted to be able to say out on the political stump that he wasn't afraid to meet with families who lost loved one's in the war.&quot;<BR>

Designing the Future<BR>
<BR>
May 16, 2005<BR>
<BR>
Newsweek - May 16, 2005 issue<BR>
<BR>
In a new interview series, NEWSWEEK talks to a leading ecological architect whose goal is nothing less than eliminating waste and pollution.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine buildings that generate more energy than they consume and factories whose waste water is clean enough to drink. William McDonough has accomplished these tasks and more. Architect, industrial designer and founder of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry in Charlottesville, Virginia, he's not your traditional environmentalist. Others may expend their energy fighting for stricter environmental regulations and repeating the mantra &quot;reduce, reuse, recycle.&quot; McDonough's vision for the future includes factories so safe they need no regulation, and novel, safe materials that can be totally reprocessed into new goods, so there's no reason to scale back consumption (or lose jobs). In short, he wants to overhaul the Industrial Revolution -- which would sound crazy if he weren't working with Fortune 500 companies and the government of China to make it happen. The recipient of two U.S. presidential honors and the National Design Award, McDonough is the former dean of architecture at the University of Virginia and co-chair of the China-U.S. Center for Sustainable Development. He spoke in New York recently with NEWSWEEK's Anne Underwood.<BR>
<BR>
UNDERWOOD: Why do we need a new industrial revolution?<BR>
MCDONOUGH: The Industrial Revolution as a whole was not designed. It took shape gradually as industrialists and engineers figured out how to make things. The result is that we put billions of pounds of toxic materials in the air, water and soil every year and generate gigantic amounts of waste. If our goal is to destroy the world -- to produce global warming and toxicity and endocrine disruption -- we're doing great. But if the goal isn't global warming, what is? I want to crank the wheel of industry in a different direction to produce a world of abundance and good design -- a delightful, safe world that our children can play in.<BR>
<BR>
You say that recycling, as it's currently practiced, is &quot;downcycling.&quot;<BR>
What we call recycling is typically the product losing its quality. Paper gets mixed with other papers, re-chlorinated and contaminated with toxic inks. The fiber length gets shorter, allowing more particles to abrade into the air, where they get into your lungs and nasal passages, and cause irritation. And you end up with gray, fuzzy stuff that doesn't really work for you. That's downcycling.<BR>
<BR>
[My mentor and colleague] Michael Braungart and I coined the term upcycling, meaning that the product could actually get better as it comes through the system. For example, some plastic bottles contain the resi-dues of heavy-metal catalysts. We can remove those residues as the bottles come back to be upcycled.<BR>
<BR>
Not all products lend themselves to that.<BR>
Most manufacturers take resources out of the ground and convert them to products that are designed to be thrown away or incinerated within months. We call these &quot;cradle to grave&quot; product flows. Our answer to that is &quot;cradle to cradle&quot; design. Everything is reused -- either returned to the soil as nontoxic &quot;biological nutrients&quot; that will biodegrade safely, or returned to industry as &quot;technical nutrients&quot; that can be infinitely recycled. Aluminum is a technical nutrient. It takes tremendous energy to make, but it's easy to recapture and reuse. Since 1880, the human species has made 660 million tons of it. We still know where 440 million tons are today.<BR>
<BR>
Are there products already that meet cradle-to-cradle goals? If so, how do we find them?<BR>
Within the month, we will be branding cradle to cradle. Products that meet our criteria for biological and technical nutrients can be certified to use our logo. A note on the packaging will tell you how to recycle it. You'll know: this one goes into my tomato plot when I'm finished or this one goes back to industry forever. We have already approved a nylon, some polyester textiles, running tracks, window shades, chairs from Herman Miller and Steelcase, and carpets from Shaw, which is part of Berkshire Hathaway. The first was a Steelcase fabric that can go back to the soil. We're now working on electronics on a global scale.<BR>
<BR>
How do paper products like magazines fit into this picture?<BR>
Why take something as exquisite as a tree and knock it down? Trees make oxygen, sequester carbon, distill water, build soils, convert solar energy to fuel, change colors with the seasons, create microclimates and provide habitat.<BR>
<BR>
My book &quot;Cradle to Cradle,&quot; which I wrote with Michael Braungart, is printed on pages made of plastic resins and inorganic fillers that are infinitely recyclable. They're too heavy, but we're working with companies now to develop lightweight plastic papers. We have safe, lightweight inks designed to float off the paper in a bath of 180 degrees -- hotter than you would encounter under normal circumstances. We can recapture the inks and reuse them without adding chlorine and dioxins to the environment. And the pages are clean, smooth and white.<BR>
<BR>
So we can keep our trees and have newspapers, too.<BR>
Most environmentalists feel guilty about how society behaves, so they say we should make longer-lasting products -- for example, a car that lasts 25 years. That car will still use compound epoxies and toxic adhesives, but the ecological footprint is reduced because you've amortized it over a longer time. But what's the result? You lose jobs because people aren't buying as much, and you're using the wrong technology longer. I want five-year cars. Then you can always be getting the newest car -- more solar-powered, cleaner, with the newest air bags and safety features. The old car gets upcycled into new cars, so there are still plenty of jobs. And you don't feel guilty about throwing the old one away. People want new technology. You're not typing on an Underwood, if you know what I mean.<BR>
<BR>
So growth is good?<BR>
Yes, if you use nature as a model and mentor, if you use modern designs and chemicals that are safe. Growth is destructive if you use energy not from the sun and a system of chemicals that is toxic, so it's anti-life.<BR>
<BR>
Given that industry today fits your definition of anti-life, why aren't you fighting for stricter environmental regulations?<BR>
If coal plants release mercury -- and mercury is a neurotoxin that damages children's brains -- then reducing the amount of mercury in emissions doesn't stop that. It just says, &quot;We'll tell you at what rate you can dispense death.&quot; Being less bad is not being good. Our idea is to make production so clean, there's nothing bad left to regulate. This is extremely interesting to people of all political persuasions -- those who love the environment and those who want commerce free of regulation.<BR>
<BR>
Can you really have industry so clean it requires no controls?<BR>
[At the Rohner textile plant in Switzerland] we designed a fabric safe enough to eat. The manufacturing process uses no mutagens, carcinogens, endocrine disrupters, heavy-metal contaminants or chemicals that cause ozone depletion, allergies, skin desensitization or plant and fish toxicity. We screened 8,000 commonly used chemicals and ended up with 38. When inspectors measured the effluent water, they thought their instruments were broken. The water was as clean as Swiss drinking water. A garden club started using the waste trimmings as mulch. Workers no longer had to wear protective clothing. And it eliminated regulatory paperwork, so they've reduced the cost of production by 20 percent. Why spend money on paperwork, when you can spend it delivering service or paying your workers a living wage?<BR>
<BR>
Where would I find this fabric?<BR>
It was selected for upholstery on the new Airbus 380. It's made of worsted wool to keep you at the right temperature -- cool when it's hot and warm when it's cold -- and [a plant fiber called] ramie to wick away moisture. It's a high-performance-design product. Going ecological doesn't mean downgrading performance criteria.<BR>
<BR>
How do you get more industries to adopt these ideals?<BR>
Industries don't change unless they have to or there's some commercial benefit. At Herman Miller [the furniture company], we designed a factory full of daylight and fresh air. Productivity soared. And because of all the natural light, they cut lighting costs by 50 percent -- overall energy by 30 percent. We've been doing this a long time. But now that China has taken it up, it portends exciting things.<BR>
<BR>
What are you doing in China?<BR>
The China Housing Industry Association has the responsibility for building housing for 400 million people in the next 12 years. We're working with them to design seven new cities. We're identifying building materials of the future, such as a new polystyrene from BASF [with no noxious chemicals]. It can be used to build walls that are strong, lightweight and superinsulating. The building can be heated and cooled for next to nothing. And it's silent. If there are 13 people in the apartment upstairs, you won't hear them.<BR>
<BR>
We've designed a luxurious new toilet. The bowl is like a lotus leaf -- so smooth, axle grease slips right off. Nothing sticks to it, including bacteria. A light mist when you're done will be enough to flush it, so you won't use lots of water. We'll have bamboo wetlands nearby to purify the waste -- and the bamboo, which grows a foot a day, can be harvested and used for wood.<BR>
<BR>
The Chinese are afraid urbanization will reduce productive farmland, so we'll move farms onto rooftops. At least, that's what I'm proposing. The farmers can live downstairs. And when you look at the city from a distance, it will look like part of the landscape.<BR>
<BR>
Is it practical to put farms on roofs?<BR>
Traditional roofs aren't practical. They degrade from thermal shock and ultraviolet radiation and have to be replaced in 20 years. For the Gap's corporate campus in San Bruno, Calif., we planted a &quot;green roof&quot; of ancient grasses. The roof now damps the sounds of jets from the San Francisco airport. It absorbs storm water, which is important because they have serious issues with storm water there. It makes oxygen, provides habitat, and it's beautiful. We also made a green roof for Ford Motor Co.'s River Rouge plant. It saved Ford millions of dollars in storm-water equipment.<BR>
<BR>
How will you fuel the Chinese cities?<BR>
I want to see solar power cheaper than coal, but to get the speed and scale to do that fast, you need a place like China. We're not talking about dinky solar collectors on roofs. Think of square miles of marginal land covered with them. This could drop the cost of solar energy an order of magnitude. And for every job making solar panels, there are four jobs putting them in place and maintaining them. We could import these panels, and for every job the Chinese give themselves, we get four. What a gift. And I guarantee you, China will never be able to capture an American photon. We would have indigenous energy and energy security. And we wouldn't be throwing our money into holes in the ground.<BR>
<BR>
And we wouldn't need nuclear energy.<BR>
I love nuclear energy. I just want to make sure it stays where God put it -- 93 million miles away, in the sun.<BR>
<BR>
Your ideas are really catching on.<BR>
It's an amazing moment in history. We also have two huge new projects in England -- working with the cities of Greenwich and Wembley. The developer, Adrian Wyatt, has asked us to conceive the meta-framework for the project.<BR>
<BR>
We won't get everything right the first time. Change requires experimentation. But no problem can be solved by the same consciousness that created it. Our job is to dream -- and to make those dreams happen.<BR>

Peak Oil Crisis: Mid-Year 2005<BR>
<http://www.fcnp.com/518/peakoil.htm>http://www.fcnp.com/518/peakoil.htm<BR>
As we enter the second half of the year, there is still no general recognition that a world-class crisis is about to take place.Optimism abounds. (...) These developments again raise the question of what it will take to trigger public recognition by the major industrial powers that a disaster of monumental proportions is near. Obviously, no responsible leader wants to trigger a panic by openly announcing oil will soon become very expensive, and then very scarce, and finally unavailable. But, there are many subterfuges that could be used as a pretext for taking drastic action without even mentioning the concept of peak oil.The Europeans and the Japanese seem to be on the verge of doing something under the banner of slowing global warming which is quite acceptable to talk about and may someday prove to be more serious than peak oil. Policies which mitigate global warming by lowering consumption of fossil fuels, are the same ones that would be used to mitigate the initial stages of an energy crisis. Last weekend, the British announced the cabinet would soon consider a form of energy rationing called a �personal carbon allowance.� (...) Thus, as we move into the Summer of 2005, it would appear that the United States , the most oil dependent country on earth, is in near total denial about the twin specters of global warming and peak oil.

Pilgrimage to humanise money<BR>
<BR>
Sabine Lichtenfels<BR>
<BR>
Those who are against war need a vision for peace.<BR>
<BR>
The globalisation of violence must be followed by the globalisation of peace.<BR>
<BR>
I am going on a pilgrimage in an attempt to humanise money. I no longer have private property, instead I dedicate my actions to the community of all creatures. I will travel where ever I am asked to go. Let us stop lying to ourselves: peace has to be learnt just as much as war has been.<BR>
<BR>
If we are not willing to invest all of our energy, all of our money and all of our intelligence to build up peace cultures there will be no peace on earth.<BR>
<BR>
What if our adventure is no longer war but peace?<BR>
<BR>
What if the financing of the global war culture would be turned into the financing of a global peace culture?<BR>
<BR>
What if just 1% of disposable funds would be invested to build up realistic models for a future worth living?<BR>
<BR>
What if we were able to unburden the earth from her nightmare within a short period of time?<BR>
<BR>
Future humankind does not need an arms industry, but a &quot;peace industry&quot;. The development of a Peace Village, e. g. in Palestine, India or Colombia could be financed with the money needed for just one tank.<BR>
<BR>
The building-up of such global Peace Villages is no longer a matter of whether we want to or not. We have to do it. If enough know-how, enough intelligence, enough determination and enough money is combined there is no reason why it should not work out.<BR>
<BR>
The world needs a new perspective.<BR>
<BR>
We need new models for a human co-habitance and for the ethics of trust. We need new models for a non-violent co-operation with nature and creation. We need models for a new civilisation on our planet. We do not need them just with words, instead we have to build them up. Millions of young people are forced to participate in war. Millions of them would refuse if a human alternative, with the necessary mental/spiritual and material funds, was available.<BR>
<BR>
To realise that we have researched innovative social models for over 25 years now. Together with other pioneers for a future worth living, the Healing Biotopes project was founded ten years ago. Concrete models for a non-violent future have arisen from this.<BR>
<BR>
The experiment 'Monte Cerro', a 3 year training program for young peace workers in the development of peace research villages, will begin from May 2006.<BR>
What is already at our disposal:<BR>
<BR>
- a training site consisting of 134 ha and about 150 voluntary teachers and co-workers.<BR>
- the social and technologically developed model for a Solar-Power-Village, that could serve as a model in the southern crisis zones on earth.<BR>
- a human co-operation network of peace workers in Israel/Palestine, Colombia and India. The next Peace Research Village is planned in Israel/Palestine as a concrete contribution for the work of reconciliation on location.<BR>
<BR>
What is missing are the funds and protection for our work in public. I have decided to take this idea with me on a pilgrimage. I ask everyone who is interested in a human redistribution of funds: invest your money in a global aid as the way out of the blind alley of our time. Give your money so that future children will no longer be maimed or burnt on the battlefields.<BR>
<BR>
I will go on pilgrimage to bring this idea into the public. My steps against war are no longer against existing structures, instead I invest my whole strength to build up new perspectives.<BR>
<BR>
I ask every person who understands the Healing Biotope project: help to make it work. Help to bring the project into the public so that a &quot;Movement for a Free Earth&quot; can arise. Inform appropriate media outlets. Inform your friends. Inform potential sponsors, beneficaries, and alliances. Support this project of a global peace initiative.<BR>
<BR>
I will go on pilgrimage just as the previous pilgrims did, and still do today. I start my way in order to collect for the erection of cathedrals for the new period. In previous centuries the attempt was made to express the holiness of life in harmonical figures, in geometrical patterns, and in the forms of temples and cathedrals. However, in contemporary times, they must be converted into real living conditions, of work, of living and love, in technology and organisation, to social structures and ethical ecology.<BR>
<BR>
I go on pilgrimage for the humanisation of money.<BR>
<BR>
I do not have any private property left, instead I dedicate my actions to the community of all creatures. I will also travel by car, train or plane if I receive the money necessary for that. I will travel to places where I am called to go. If you know of a place where you wish the project to be presented I will come there to speak about it in public.<BR>
<BR>
My way will begin in Germany, and from there I will travel via Switzerland, Italy and several other countries. A large part of this journey will be done on foot. My way will lead me to the 'Holy Land&#130;. The war in this country concerns all of us. If peace succeeds here, it could succeed globally. We can not stay in silent agony when walls are repeatedly built between people.<BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of November I will go on pilgrimage to Bethlehem and Jerusalem with a larger group of people to make the project of a possible peace alternative known there as well. We will also introduce the play 'We Refuse to be Enemies&#130; to a wider public audience.<BR>
<BR>
My first aim:<BR>
<BR>
The construction of a free Academy in Tamera, Portugal. I will stay on pilgrimage until I have collected the necessary funds for the construction of a training building. We need this building as the first place for the many students who want to dedicate their studies to the service of the world.<BR>
<BR>
I will be on pilgrimage until I have either found<BR>
1 person who is willing to give 400.000 Euro<BR>
or 10 people who give 40.000 Euro<BR>
or 100 people who give 4.000 Euro<BR>
or 1,000 people who give 400 Euro<BR>
or 10,000 people who give 40 Euro<BR>
or 100,0000 people who give 4 Euro<BR>
<BR>
I will travel to every place where I am asked to go. Everybody who thinks this idea is right can contribute something in his or her own way. Together we can make the money flow for the construction of a better world.<BR>
<BR>

Nuclear Dinosaur<BR>
<BR>
By Peter Asmus - The Washington Post<BR>
<BR>
06 July 2005<BR>
<BR>
The recent call by President Bush to restart a major nuclear power program in this country in response to concerns about our dependence on foreign energy sources and global climate change would have Adam Smith rolling in his grave.<BR>
<BR>
There is no power source less compatible with the GOP's love of free markets and disdain for regulation and subsidy than nuclear fission. Without government intervention, there simply would be no nuclear industry.<BR>
<BR>
Now, it is true that nuclear energy does not contribute to global climate change. And the new pebble bed modular reactor may well leak less, greatly reduce the risks of catastrophic meltdown and use less uranium fuel. But nuclear power is far from being clean or green. Consider the following:<BR>
<BR>
* In the nuclear fuel process, uranium enrichment depends on great amounts of electricity, most of which is provided by dirty fossil fuel plants releasing all of the traditional air pollution emissions not released by the nuclear reactor itself. Two of the nation's most polluting coal plants, in Ohio and Indiana, produce electricity primarily for uranium enrichment.<BR>
* The operations of nuclear power plants release dangerous air emissions in the form of radioactive gases, including carbon-14, iodine-131, krypton and xenon.<BR>
* Uranium mining mimics techniques used for coal, and similar issues of toxic contamination of local land and water resources arise - as does the matter of the unique radioactive contamination hazards to mine workers and nearby populations. Abandoned mines contaminated with high-level radioactive waste can pose radioactive risks for as long as 250,000 years after closure.<BR>
* Concerns about chronic or routine exposure to radiation are augmented by the supreme risk of catastrophe in the event of power plant accidents. A major failure in the nuclear power plant's cooling systems, such as the rupture of the reactor vessel, can create a nuclear &quot;meltdown.&quot; Catastrophic accidents could easily kill 100,000 people.<BR>
<BR>
I first learned about the electricity industry when I covered the battle to close the Rancho Seco nuclear plant in Sacramento in the 1980s. A long list of problems had resulted in local rate increases exceeding 200 percent. There were rumors of drug use, and even sex orgies, under the immense cooling towers. The picture painted by some insiders was of an operations crew made up of a bunch of yahoos who would fit right into an episode of &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Over the next 15 years, I learned the ins and outs of the electricity business, the world's largest - and most polluting - industrial enterprise. The subject is boring and complex, which has led to ignorance about its extremely important activities. Past decisions authorizing a spate of nuclear plants were made with little scrutiny of their economic or environmental impacts. The consequences of those decisions, and the government subsidies that helped promote the fiction that they were cost-effective, helped set the stage for today's crisis in energy supply.<BR>
<BR>
The United States, with its 103 operating nuclear power plants, is already the world's top consumer of electricity generated from nuclear fission. But we have yet to build a federal repository for nuclear waste. Given that U.S. reactors produce about 2,000 tons of high-level waste every year of operation, calling for greater reliance on nuclear power is not only supremely irresponsible but also an insult to the &quot;conservative&quot; wing of the Republican Party. Teddy Roosevelt is also turning over in his grave.<BR>
<BR>
That Republicans call for more nuclear power is truly mind-boggling. There has never been a more subsidized, socialized power technology than nuclear. Virtually all of the countries that derive the greatest amount of electricity from nuclear power - France, Lithuania, Ukraine, Sweden - feature central planning and socialistic energy policies.<BR>
<BR>
Real, free-market energy policies suggest smaller, smarter and cleaner power sources. The last thing the United States should embark on in these volatile times tainted by the terrorist threat is the dinosaur technology that is nuclear power.<BR>

APOLLO 10 GETS GLIMPSE OF AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL MONOLITH IN SPACE<BR>
<BR>
LATER A SECRET MILITARY SPACE SHUTTLE RETRIEVES THE SPACE BEACON<BR>
<BR>
By Richard Boylan, Ph.D. &copy; 1998<BR>
<BR>
The following information was disclosed to me by a reliable confidential informant, who previously worked on contract for the National Security Agency, and maintains connections within the Intelligence community. This informant, whom I shall call &quot;Jesse&quot;, has over 40 years of notes from a very close relative, who served as CIA liaison to the National Security Council on UFO/ET matters. This information has been confirmed by a second source, Dr. Michael Wolf of the National Security Council's unacknowledged subcommittee, the MJ-12 Special Studies goup. I have talked with Dr. Wolf about the notes' author, Jesse's relative. Dr. Wolf said that that CIA official &quot;was like an uncle to me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The reports which follow are thus not &quot;leaks&quot;, but rather based on planned releases of information. These releases are part of a public Acclimation Program, an official though unacknowledged U.S. Government policy of &quot;processed release of information&quot;, as Dr. Wolf described it.<BR>
<BR>
According to &quot;Jesse&quot;, in 1969 the Apollo 10 astronauts Stafford, Cernan and Young were the first to film an extraterrestrial space beacon, dubbed The Monolith, somewhat like, but smaller than, the one in Arthur C. Clarke's book/movie &quot;2001&quot;. They were not, however, the first astronauts to spot this ET beacon. The Monolith was first sighted by Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, in 1961. He was followed into space that same year by American astronaut Alan Shephard, who also sighted the beacon. Apollo 10 went to it, and filmed it from every angle. The Monolith acted like a communication beacon. Jesse said, &quot;It sort of acts like the message received in the movie &quot;Contact&quot;. It had a message on it, in addition to a map of the extraterrestrial civilization which placed it there], and how to get to them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Apollo 10 astronauts brought back the message captured on film. The Monolith's energy affected Apollo 10's instrumentation, so that its crew almost didn't get back. As soon as the film Apollo 10 took came back to Earth, those Intelligence compartments which deal with UFOs were busy poring over information from the Monolith.<BR>
<BR>
The government then used an early secret military space shuttle to go get the Monolith itself. This covert military spacecraft flew years before the first &quot;official&quot; NASA Shuttle's public flights in 1981. The spaceplane is operated by a secret military astronaut program out of Vandenburg Air Force Base, California, among other locations. The second flight mission of this unacknowledged military shuttle retrieved the Monolith, and brought it back to Earth in 1972 for study. [1]<BR>
<BR>
After being retrieved, the Monolith was then transferred to a secret research facility. Scientific analysis of the Monolith was conducted at this domed underwater facility located north of Abaco, the northernmost of the Bahamas Islands. RCA Corporation is in charge of that experimentation research, Jesse says. Jesse stated, &quot;They did it underwater, after they saw people dropping like flies. They figured that there would be better containment [of the Monolith's suspected cosmic energy emanations] underwater.&quot; He noted that the space beacon &quot;has a sound to it, like it talks. It also gives off a light show.&quot; Dr. Michael Wolf shed additional light on the beacons. &quot;They are 'postcards from the rim'. They emit both light and tone signals, sending a mathematical language. There may be five or more ET civilizations involved in setting up these beacons.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Among the scientists who worked on it were famed astronomer Dr. Carl Sagan, U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command General William Stubblebine, (ret.), National Security Council consultant Dr. Michael Wolf, and a former division head of CIA. Everyone who had prolonged close physical contact with the Monolith got cancer, Jesse says. &quot;And those who tried to dissect it [the Monolith] died right there on the spot.&quot; The CIA Counter-Intelligence official and Dr. Wolf got colon cancer. The CIA man required surgery, but Dr. Wolf's cancer later went into a spontaneous remission. Dr. Sagan eventually died of his cancer.<BR>
<BR>
Jesse feels that there are many more space beacons out in space, acting as &quot;postcards&quot;. &quot;I'm sure Mother Russia had one.&quot; [2]<BR>
<BR>
Jesse also revealed a 1973 formula for gravity control, used by the military to construct antigravity aerospace vehicles.[a] He disclosed that noted quantum physicist Jack Sarfatti was in a position to be familiar with this gravity formula used by the government. Jesse observed, &quot;With regard to Sarfatti, as I can determine it [from the notes], he was on site doing work on the relationship between downed UFO's and back-engineering, to the degree that he assisted in the gravity makeup formulae.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Jesse added that Sarfatti noticed that the captured UFO's field propulsion guidance was focused on the ET pilot. &quot;[The UFO pilot console] had the hand placement with micro holes and light-emitting senses [sensors] to feel the impulse of the sudden hand movement; hence it [pilot and UFO] became as one. The driver always feels the outer skin's 'road feel', so it [the UFO] can handle better than a Corvette at 125 mph in fifth gear in the big curve.&quot; Jesse added, &quot;Then again, Sarfatti has these [formula] numbers...he can attest to the numbers and even affirm that [antigravity field propulsion] is in use today! Matter of fact, the formulae even tell a story of the skin association between flyer and craft.&quot; [3] They [ET pilots] think [a command]...and go. Sort of like...point-click and ship! Boom...you're there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The RAND Corporation (a CIA think tank) holds the key to the [gravity-control] formulae.&quot; Jesse revealed. &quot;Our Navy even set up the United Earth Space Naval Forces. I believe this group to be in existence today.&quot; [4]<BR>
<BR>
U.S. Government's old gravity-control formula:<BR>
<BR>
[a] phi(x) =0lphi(x) l0 &gt; + &phi(x), where 0lphi(x)l0&gt; is the vacuum expectation value, and m2^0lphi(x)l0&gt;^2 represents the particle's density of the ground state in the non-relativistic limit. The action of this field in the presence of gravity is...intrinsic gravitational cosmological constant Lambda/ 8piG receives a contribution (1/2) m2^0lphi(x)l0&gt;^2<BR>

ET BASE ON EARTHSANCTIONED BY OFFICIALS SINCE 1954 CONFIRMED<BR>
<a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/etbase.html">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/etbase.html</a><BR>
(...) Shortly after establishing itself, the Bilderberg Group collaborated with the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), another international policy body devoted to world management, concerning the problem of adjusting humankind to extraterrestrial presence. Bilderberg and CFR decided jointly in the mid-1950s to enter into an arrangement with the extraterrestrials: The ETs were given an island in French Polynesia as a base on Earth. This arrangement afforded them an opportunity to monitor closely Earth cultures and behavior; and it permitted Earth governments a way to monitor extraterrestrial culture and behavior. &quot;It became an on-going experiment,&quot; as my former-NSA informant put it. He adds that when official public announcement of the extraterrestrial presence occurs, &quot;they will be the ones introduced to Earthlings; 'Oh, by the way, we want to welcome our neighbors from the Pleiades, who by the way have been here since [the beginning of Earth] time, but [are] actually living in our place, date, space and time.'&quot; &quot;They are the diplomatic corps.&quot; My ex-NSA informant reported that the U.S. particularly held out for many concessions before agreeing to the arrangement. (He did not specify what those concessions were, but history subsequent to 1954 suggests that what the U.S. obtained was the lion's share of extraterrestrial scientist consultants, to assist American scientists in understanding and adapting exotic ET technologies into such devices we now know as the computer chip, fibre optics, lasers, gene-splicing therapy, cloning, night-vision equipment, super-tenacity fibers (such as Kevlar lightweight armor), aerospace ceramics, Stealth technology, particle-beam devices, and gravity-control flight.)

SECRET US/USSR MANNED SPACE STATION IN ORBIT FOR PAST 30 YEARS DISCLOSED<BR>
<a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/etbase.html">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/pages/etbase.html</a><BR>
(...) Ignore those Boeing commercials and the NASA press releases about how America &quot;soon&quot; will have its own first manned space station. My ex-NSA informant revealed that there has been a manned &quot;deep space platform&quot; in orbit above Earth for over thirty years! &quot;It [has] had three-manned [American] crews as well as Russians 'on' since '68!&quot; He further states that since 1973, the space station received additional extremely-high technology, &quot;and has had upgrades since.&quot; His disclosures confirms reports I had heard previously from former military officers about a secret space platform in orbit. This disclosure makes clear, as does my earlier report about a secret military astronaut program retrieving the &quot;Apollo 10&quot; Monolith in 1972 for study, that the Cape Canaveral Space Shuttles launches and the &quot;first American&quot; space station on NASA's drawing boards are just government &quot;cover&quot; programs. Such programs have served to deflect the public from becoming aware before now of the existence of a black-project military space station and classified military craft which can go well past orbit into deep space. The ex-NSA informant, who provided information on a secret U.S.-USSR manned spacestation in orbit since 1968, now has furnished me additional details about its operation. The space station has been serviced by secret military spacecraft long before the first American Space Shuttle flew in 1981. In 1988 previous spacefaring vehicles were superseded by the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, a spacecraft with a rounded delta shape built jointly by special projects divisions of Europe's Airbus Industrie and U.S.'s Boeing Corporation. Nautilus has a propulsion system which utilizes magnetic pulsing. Nautilus-type craft make twice-weekly trips up into space and back, to service the secret international space station. The Nautilus is based in Utah. (Although my informant did not identify the base, the likely candidates are the Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, or Hill Air Force Base Range.) Nautilus-class craft were also used at the beginning of the Gulf War, to penetrate Iraqi airspace from space. Soon thereafter, Stealth aircraft took over covert penetration operations.<BR>

G8 Leaders Told It Pays to Protect Forests<BR>
<BR>
By Edith M. Lederer - The Associated Press<BR>
<BR>
06 July 2005<BR>
<BR>
United Nations - The U.N. environment chief has a message for leaders of the world's major industrialized nations: scientists have shown that it pays to preserve forests, coastal waters and marshes.<BR>
<BR>
Klaus Toepfer made the case that investing in the environment will go a long way toward meeting U.N. goals to reduce poverty, supply clean drinking water and fight the spread of infectious diseases.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our motto is environment for development,&quot; he said in an interview last week.<BR>
<BR>
The Group of Eight meets in Scotland on Wednesday and will address global warming and climate change - and Toepfer expressed hope that the leaders will see the link between this critical issue and development.<BR>
<BR>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is hosting the summit, wants an agreement among G-8 leaders on the scientific threat posed by global warming and the urgent need for action.<BR>
<BR>
But the United States rejects the Kyoto Protocol, which calls for cutting carbon dioxide and other gas emissions believed to contribute to global warming. President Bush has called for shifting the debate away from limits on greenhouse gas emissions to new technology that would reduce environmental damage without restricting energy use.<BR>
<BR>
Toepfer, who heads the Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program, said scientific data show that destruction of the environment is a direct cause of many problems faced in the world today - including poverty, declining health, hunger, undrinkable water, disease, migration from rural to urban areas, and conflict.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So the environment is not a luxury, not a Gucci accessory bag or a fancy silk tie affordable only when all other issues have been resolved,&quot; he told a U.N. ministerial meeting last week. &quot;It is the oxygen breathing life into all the goals. It is the red ribbon running around our common aspirations for a healthier, more stable and just world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Toepfer said the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment - a recent study compiled by 1,360 scientists from 95 nations who pored over 16,000 satellite photos from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration and analyzed statistics and scientific journals - underscored that the environment is critically important for development.<BR>
<BR>
The study found that humans had depleted 60 percent of the world's grasslands, forests, farmlands, rivers and lakes. It also found that 12 percent of birds, 23 percent of mammals, 25 percent of conifers and 32 percent of amphibians are threatened with extinction - and that the world's fish stocks have been reduced by 90 percent since the start of industrial fishing.<BR>
