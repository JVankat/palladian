<br><a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k="></a>   In<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k="></a>   the<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k="></a>   long<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k="></a>   Chinese history, the 20th century, social change is the largest and fastest-growing, most complex and tortuous, and therefore the most exciting century. As a social and human sciences a branch of Chinese classical literature study, the degree of change in this century is also very large, can be described as unprecedented. Study of classical literature in China, to the school of thousands of years of prosperity has a history, tradition deep in this century and the new historical conditions, it is also salty and reformist, constantly changing its structure and appearance, made new with the times adapt achievement. In the end of the century today, recalling the classical literature of this century, a century-old history, summed up its success or failure, you can give us the discipline in this century have a clear path taken by the self-awareness, but also for the next century, the healthy <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Development">Development</a>   of the discipline provide important reference and basis. 
<br>
<br> Chinese classical literature in this century, generally speaking, traversed by a classical model evolving toward the modern road. Academic modernization, where a hundred years the main line of development. Modernization process, covering the whole of the subjects and aspects, which includes the academic ideas and scholarly methods, as well as the results of academic concepts and methods - academic results produced, as well as the academic concepts and methods of the embodiment - disciplinary talents to cultivate. Area of <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Research">Research</a>   in classical literature, the modern concept of academic, mainly introduced to China early this century with the Enlightenment, the nature of the modern concepts, such as the concept of the civilian literature, literature for the concept of life, etc.; modern scientific concepts, such as the concept of evolution and so on. These concepts, significantly different from the traditional Chinese Zheng-sheng, were upon the concept of the text in order to set out the concept of Tao, retro concept. Modernization of the academic approach is that modern scientific methods, they are also significantly different from the traditional Chinese classics, the article studies approach. Of course, the modernization of the academic concepts and methods, but also subsequently introduced to China's Marxist historical materialism of the concepts and methods, as well as two or three decades on behalf of the introduction of the "modern-ism," 80 years passed in a "post-modernism "The concepts and methods, these concepts and methods, each different in nature, there are many differences, and even fundamental differences, the situation is very complicated, but the classical Chinese tradition of thinking of the academic Relatively speaking, they are undoubtedly of the modern properties. 
<br>
<br> Of this century, study of classical literature, in general can be divided into four periods. Divided into four periods based on different periods is mainly <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Research">Research</a>   concepts and <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Research">Research</a>   methods on the basic conditions, and this situation is determined primarily by the <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Development">Development</a>   of modern subjects of different degrees. The first period from 1900 to 1928, which is the initial period of modern disciplines. The second period from 1928 to 1949, which is subject modernization period of development. The third period from 1949 to 1978, this is a period of a unified discipline, but also modern twists and turns of the period. The fourth period from 1978 to the end of the century, which is subject order out of chaos and diverse period of development, modernization is the re-<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Development">Development</a>   period. 
<br>
<br> 1 
<br> The first period, is the study of classical literature onto the road of the early modern times. In this period, the ideological and cultural aspects of the main trend of Modern Ideological ideas spread and establishment in China. Modern Ideological since the mid-19th century had already begun from the West into China, the beginning of this century, it is in the "Western Learning," the crucial moment. Western introduced new ideas, the then reformist reformists and anti-revolutionaries who have a full impact on the time of China's cultural and academic, but also quite touching. For example, in the beginning of the century Liang's "novel world revolution," the novel of society strongly thrust-weight "group rule", noting that the novel of "four kinds of power", in favor of raising the status of the novel is the concept by the impact of modern western fiction. However, "Revolution of the novel," "Poetic Revolution" and other literature, the reform advocates, although the formation of a certain momentum, mainly it is specifically targeted at the creation and the hair; in classical literature research, perhaps because of this ancient academic distance from the Territory and Politics far away, so the impact is not great obviously. The beginning of this century, the classical literature, it should be said that basically classical studies (including the Qing Dynasty, "Han") and Tongcheng School articles to learn the world. Study of classical literature was still ancient commentaries, version collated, Yi-Wen close series, articles, commentaries, and so on Ci Poetry mainly, and its accomplishments, of course can not be denied, such as the Sun Yirang "Mozi idle Gu," Wang Xianqian "Poetry 3-yi Set Shu "and so on, but that is the ancient tradition of scholarship to falter, but it also goes without saying. 
<br>
<br> The new study, however, penetrated the old school piece of terrain is not a traditional lead-free, when someone Progenitors gesture, would be the introduction of modern concepts and methods of the study of ancient literature, namely Wang Guowei. Wang in 1904 wrote "Dream of Red Mansions comments", the article from the life and "art" since the relationship between the theory, pointing out that the "beautiful" "sublime" is different, and then discusses "" Dream of Red Mansions "in spirit", but also Analysis, "" Dream of Red Mansions "is the aesthetic value", "" Dream of Red Mansions "is the value of ethics." Although he affected by the impact of Schopenhauer's <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=philosophy">philosophy</a>   of pessimism is deep, its specific conclusions may not be quite correct, but the important thing is not the specific conclusions of this article, but his literary works and life will be linked with the aesthetics, <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b150">Ethics</a>   linked of their research is a new perspective, and its concept is completely modern in nature. In the "Dream of Red Mansions" research the history of research in the whole history of classical literature, this is the first time the study of modern style, but this article is the first truly modern-style paper articles. Therefore, Wang Guowei is a Chinese classical literature the road towards the first person in modern times. Wang Guowei, the study of classical literature, modern style is still very lonely, and is still "public opinion, the word chapter on researching the" science of diffuse known to the world. But there are also echoed by a few, that is, A, and Huang Lin Chuan-2 in the history of Chinese literature in the preparation of trying. Lin for the metropolitan college teacher in 1904 compiled a "History of Chinese Literature," lecture notes; He also serves as the faculty at Soochow University, about 1905 to write the "History of Chinese Literature," lecture notes. The preparation of Chinese literary history of the move, no doubt influenced by the impact of foreign scholars, when the Russians Vasilyev, the British and the Japanese city Giles Sadakichi, have long been the "History of Chinese Literature," come out. Lin's history, that is modeled on Japan's Waseda University, traces of handouts. These two literary history, as the grassroots of the people to make, level is not high: Forest history of the object is unknown, style confusion, the book philology, calligraphy, Exegesis, classical studies, history and literature such as an access In the meantime, Huang Shi is a large number of transcription original text, voluminous Wuza. However, regarding the preparation of the history of literature itself, already a modern academic behavior, remain in the modern sense. 
<br>
<br> Modern-type large-scale study of classical literature the rise of a few years later in the 1911 Revolution. The second decade of this century, the mid-term, China has undergone a profound ideological and cultural change, and this is the spirit of modern <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b140">Democracy</a>   and science advocacy. In the spirit of <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b140">Democracy</a>   and science under the impetus of literature at that time the formation of new ideas and new concepts, there are civilians in literary ideas (Chen Duxiu and so on), promising literary life ideas (Zhou Zuo-ren and so on), a literary evolution of ideas ( Hu Shih and so on), and so on. These new ideas, the same has also been used as a starting point for examining traditional literature as a starting point for updated study of classical literature. At that time the rise of advocacy and the new trend of using scientific methods. Advocates of the scientific method with Chen Tu-hsiu and Hu Shih and others, especially Hu, spared no effort to publicize, promote scientific methods. From his "experimental-ism" idea, proposed "a bold assumption, carefully seeking sign" 10 words, as a scientific methodology of the "tips." Hu Shi and Liang Qing Qian-Jia school has also made a more systematic study, from where they are summed up in line with the spirit of science research methods 〔1〕, whose main content is analyzed and summarized, and evidence-based approach. These are basically true, certificates and formal <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b125">Logic</a>   methods, with their recent nature of the benefits is quite obvious. Thus, "54" after no few years, the study of classical literature face great changes, new concepts and new methods to use, has become the mainstream disciplines. Marked changes are: (a) study of classical literature the genuine literary study. This is the help of "literature" to clarify the concept of the progressive do. "Classical literature" in the "literature" a phrase no longer a "literary sub-wanderer Summer" of the "literary" meaning, but rather refers to poetry, novels, plays, essays and other "Mei-wen", this is a modern concept of "literature." Thereby making the study an accurate, centralized. 
<br>
<br> (B) out of the old feudal <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Culture">Culture</a>   of hatred and contempt, accusing him of doubt about history thought. New <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Culture">Culture</a>   Movement of the precursor who were right all the old cast a suspicion that is for a fresh look, pick-fat fallacies; the old era of classical studies the ideological legacy of the fog, as well as all kinds of Chan humble opinion, and widely suspected of being cleared . "Book of Songs" as the most ancient classical literature, but also in the extreme of a sacred work, a "faction doubt about history," the first anatomical object. At that time many scholars have put on the "Book of Songs" re-interpretation, such as Hu Shi, Qian Xuantong, Gu Jiegang, Yu Pingbo, Kuo Mo-jo, Kang Bai-qing, Liu white and so on, they are the "Preface" (in particular " Small Order "), represented by the ancient teacher says that he completely overturned, abandoned to his fate, but from the" Poetry 300 "text of view, directly to explore the meaning of poems to make a new interpretation. In short, classical literature and research has been incorporated into the major critique of the feudal pattern of old <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Culture">Culture</a>   and are reflected in the concept of distinct character of innovation. 
<br>
<br> (C) the growing number of researchers using analytical, inductive methods, and empirical methods for specific research work. In the p<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b124">Art</a>   of the history, classical literature and workers, the "experimentalist" approach quite popular. This primarily by John Dewey and Hu Shih's advocacy caused by Hu Shih's "Cross mantra" - "a bold assumption, be careful to double-check" as the experimentalism of the methodology, its basic spirit is positive, and for the norms of scientific research work , and raise the conscious level of methodological researchers played an active role. "Gushi Bian" party of the detection of forgeries and studying ancient history, basically the concrete <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b163">Application</a>   of empirical methods. Cijie tend to reflect the innovative approach. 
<br>
<br> (D) some research focus, in these hotspots, the new concept of new methods to achieve a major breakthrough in modern <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Technology">Technology</a>   have become the subjects displayed significant examples of great vitality. Especially in fiction, drama, folk literature and research, these studies are not in the traditional areas of importance to progress quickly, achieve much more impressive. Wang Guowei, Lu Xun, Hu Shi, who made outstanding achievements, are mainly in fiction, drama within the area. "Dream of Red Mansions" study "new Dream of Red Mansions," the birth of a new research method is a direct result. It empirical advantage, making the "Suoyin faction" of the "Old Red Mansions" legislation is far-fetched, random pull, You talk about the shortcomings of rootlessness Since then brought to its knees; and a round, the "new Dream of Red Mansions," Sui-enforcement "Dream of Red Mansions "study of the ui. 
<br>
<br> (E) reflects the modern nature of some of the major research topics, infrastructure projects, such as the History of Chinese Literature, Chinese Literature, etc., in this period, embryonic, and toward an initial maturity. Since people first "History of Chinese Literature," after a book to the late 20s, all kinds of literary history actually produced three Shiyu Bu, and the gradual standardization of the content of style. To this end of the period, the history of literature works in the object's definition, description of the contents of the arrangement, the design chapter, reviews the concept in terms of various literary history than the beginning of the century, has greatly improved, at least stereotypical of the genre that has been quite rare, and hybrid See; while a variety of specialized style and type of literary history are also emerging, such as Wang Guowei's "Song and Yuan Dynasties opera history" (1912), Lu Xun's "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction" (1923), Chen Zhong Fan, "Chinese History of Literary Criticism" (1927), etc., they are more often than write a comprehensive history of literature better and more refined, more literature and history shows the progress and direction of a rich maturity. 
<br>
<br> (F) reflects the characteristics of modern papers, research monographs, and gradually become a major research style. Since the first modern-style classical literature, research papers, "Dream of Red Mansions comments" a modern-style study of third monograph "History of Opera Song and Yuan Dynasties", the silence after a decade or so, to "54" In the future, the new research papers and monographs , and finally followed vibrant produce. Modern forms of papers, monographs (including a number of textual works), and classical studies form the basic difference is that it forms the basis of logic. As the formal logic, so I modern-style papers, monographs, etc., have a stronger 
<br> Convincing. 
<br>
<br> (Vii) the founder of the University, the University hospital Literature Literature Bureau was set up to something that began in this period, which for the cultivation of classical literature, from an educational mechanism to obtain assurances that new research teams to continue to grow and develop. The University of Literature Bureau itself, but also a new type of classical literature and research base. For example, Peking University, Arts, both 54 major hotbeds of the new literary movement, but also study of classical literature and the backbone of the power of modern technology. 
<br>
<br> (8) in the fierce collision of old and new cultures, the emergence of a number of excellent study of classical literature at home. These studies at home have a solid basic knowledge of professional, broaden the academic horizons, a keen ability to judge the academic; they generally also have more than one foreign language ability was basically Western Kanemichi; most of them also carry out literature creation, is a scholar and writer, or writers and scholars, but. In short, they integrated cultural qualities and ability to both high and strong, but also a key period of transition, What a Blissful Encounter of academic opportunities, so the achievements are greater. One of the few, such as Wang Guowei, Lu Xun, Hu Shih and also become a master of academic, discipline-oriented modernization has made a special contribution. By Wang Guowei, for example, 54 during the formation of a number of new concepts and methods, in fact, the beginning of this century, written by Wang's writings on now be seen. In his "Dream of Red Mansions comments" in the i.e. expound: "<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b124">Art</a>   in order to poetry, drama, novels of its vertices, with its description of life, it is aimed at." 54 times in this real-Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, Zhou Zuo-ren and so on "as the The Literary Life "marked the beginning of ideas. Wang from the aesthetic perspective of research "Dream of Red Mansions", where blending with the modern vision, and even 54 times more than ten years after the various "new Dream of Red Mansions" at home and also look to the Eph. "The new Dream of Red Mansions" home only to empirical methods as the basic tool, although it is a modern academic in nature, but they do not know why things aesthetic studies, and finally can not help with the "Dream of Red Mansions," the literary nature of phase membrane. Wang Cijie show beyond peers and so on, leaders of groups-lun, single provision of modern academic paths which a master style. 
<br>
<br> The above aspects of the phenomenon, marking the study of classical literature in this period, has made significant achievements, the subject initially realized by the classic traditional to modern mode. 
<br>
<br> But this time not only for the subjects the early stages of modernization, there is also bound to various deficiencies and problems. In general, that is, the process of modernization is still noticeable rough. Manifested in the academic concepts and methods as well as some specific practices, there is not comprehensive enough neat and smooth the Department, and even there exists an obvious one-sidedness. For example: 
<br>
<br> Undue attention to highlight the vernacular literature, and neglect to belittle classical Chinese learning. Hu Shi, Chen Duxiu, Qian Xuantong and so called classical Chinese science is "dead literature", only vernacular literature is the "living literature"; Hu for this compilation of "vernacular literary history" in order to implement its ideas. This kind of trade-offs vernacular as the only standard practice, is bound to ancient times, many outstanding non-"vernacular," the literary works denounced as "dead literature" is obviously unscientific and unreasonable. And what is considered as a "vernacular" and what is not "vernacular" is in fact very difficult to draw the line more difficult to grasp the scale of ancient literature, calling such style from the chaos. 
<br>
<br> Given undue prominence to the civilian <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b149">Population</a>   of ancient literature, and attempt to belittle the "aristocracy of Literature"; of aristocratic literary analysis of degraded without exclusion, no doubt is also a radical simplification of the practice. 
<br>
<br> The use of literary theory of evolution, mechanical rigid tendencies, tend to be formulaic. Many people today than in refuting the ancient tradition of the retro ideas is the right time, but the positive ideas put forward that the literature after definitely better than before, but it is too absolute, and does not take into account the particularity of literary disciplines and development of twists and turns of history. At this point, when "the School of" Mei Guangdi and others of the "new literary school" criticism, in fact, have a significant correction. 
<br>
<br> Too much emphasis on empirical scientific method, and ignore the cultural method, the human nature of the subject have been neglected. Hu put forward the "bold assumption, be careful to double-check" of the "scientific method" itself is good, but it must be pointed out that this is an empirical scientific method, it is only p<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b124">Art</a>   of the system of the scientific method, in the field of literary studies, the main Historical research can be applied to literary treatment, in studying a writer's life, works on issues such as circulation, and release more useful, as far as ancient literature, ideology, emotional changes and artistic features of such aspects of the empirical method can not necessarily be effective. Therefore, the period of "methodological master" such as Hu Shi, Gu Jiegang and so on, their "methods" in fact, primarily the implementation of the literary documents of the textual work, "Gushi Bian" faction of the identified persons, are both essentially historical problem; exposed to a more fundamental issue of cultural contents and artistic expressions, they are often showing powerless, or even deliberately avoiding talk about. 
<br>
<br> Excessive negative tradition. During the transition period, the traditional old-fashioned idea to make the necessary forces and their impact is justified. 
<br>
<br> But at that time there is doubt about history thought the traditional tendency to negate everything, showing a certain degree of nihilism color, such as Qu Yuan negate the theory of Yu negativism and so on, are made in this background. 
<br>
<br> The above can be understood that discipline is difficult to avoid overkill during the inter-face phenomenon, can not be denied here, contains a lot of one-sidedness, to be overcome. 
<br>
<br> Two 
<br> In the second period, the study of classical literature in modern times to the breadth and depth of the development of physical discipline have also undergone major changes. This period, China's ideological and cultural fields has initially completed the transition from traditional to modern, toward the modernization of the diversity of direction. In fact, the last time with "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science" as the representative of the ideology and culture, the birthplace of Europe and the United States in their Western countries already belong to the early development of capitalism, or even the seventeenth, eighteenth-century Enlightenment thought, into the 20th century, European and American culture has already entered a new period of development - on the one hand is "modernism" culture prevalent, the other is the proletarian ideology and culture in order to surging momentum is spreading rapidly. At that time China's advanced elements Come "Mr." and "Mr. Science" for breaking the feudal autocracy the shackles of ignorance and backwardness of <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b134">Traditional Culture</a>   is undoubtedly necessary, revolutionary. Fourth Movement itself has a certain nature of enlightenment. However, when compared with the world's cultural development situation, which undoubtedly had a big gap behind. Into this period, China's continued rapid development of ideology and culture, in the process of modernization has taken a big step further, largely to keep up with the pace of the world. Its performance is, on the one hand, to "Mr." and "Mr. Science" as the protagonists of modern culture in China have been further developed, even the "modern-ism" has also been infiltrated into all kinds of ideas, some performance; the other hand, <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b145">Marxism</a>   proletarian ideology and culture has also taken root in China, and growing rapidly. 
<br>
<br> Compared with the previous period, the period of study of classical literature, on the road again in modern times has made many advances, the basic feature is a step in the direction of deepening and diversification of development: 
<br>
<br> (A) basically abandoned the "Down with aristocratic literature" like a simplistic approach, but instead of the ancient literati for thousands of years a wealth of literature to make a realistic serious analysis. 
<br>
<br> (B) is no longer a "vernacular", "classical" as the only or main criterion used to distinguish between ancient Chinese literature, recognizing the vernacular or classical just writing to express tool, do not determine the value of literary and artistic ideas. Hu to the new literary definition: the "national language of literature, literary language", its one-sidedness has been recognized by most people. Therefore, to this period, "vernacular literature" argument has been from the high and low, low rise and fall by the break. 
<br>
<br> (C) to understand and apply a more flexible theory of evolution, no longer apply evolutionary theory to a rigid body in all the classical authors. Though there are still people in this period of preparation, "the evolutionary history of Chinese literature" (Tan is bi), claimed that the "non-fiction book, not only refused the author or work, but also for degradation of the literature, but also to censure and neglect; to the evolution of literature as authentic, while the rest is peri ", showing a blunt attitude; However, most literary historians will be able to evolution theory, to compare the natural way is reflected in their study. 
<br>
<br> (D) of the ancient literary tradition who reject the attitude of the <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b149">Population</a>   is small, even for "Maoshixu" This representation of the Han Dynasty classics can be cool-headed analysis of work is certainly big "Preface" in Poetry in the history of the important position of ; "Qu Yuan's negativism," Though there are still people pass his mantle to 30 years there are still people to "" Li Sao "for examination in the Han Dynasty" (Ho-day trip), but the academic community has emerged in several of the Songs of the South really Researcher (You Guo-en, Lukan such as Kuo Mo-jo, Wen Yi-duo, Jiang Liang-fu, etc.), they and their works of Qu Yuan's research is more and more in-depth, and clearly beyond their predecessors. 
<br>
<br> (E) adhere to the spirit of scientific research, while others will pay attention to classical literature in the humanities to explore the meaning, for humanity, compassion, humanism and so on to give a considerable evaluation. Many people doing this kind of work of non-class theory, "Theory of Human Nature" persons (such as "New Humanism" by Liang Shih-chiu, Wen Yi-duo, etc.), when they were left-wing cultural camp as a "revolutionary literature" of the opponents, but in fact They are made to academic performance, for in this period, the rise of materialism class analysis in the study of the use of classical literature, made an important remedy. 
<br>
<br> (F) research methods, in addition to empirical scientific method, the more researchers begin to apply a variety of methods, especially those of modern humanistic methods, such as anthropology, mythology, folklore, psychology methods to study the Chinese Classical Literature; this will help from multi-angles and the side to reveal the richness of classical literature. Heard more than one representative in this respect, his empirical research in the historical materials at the same time, using a wide range of humanities disciplines of instruments, from the poet's keen sense of his departure, the ancient literature, especially poetry, such as "The Book of Songs," "Songs of Chu "Tang and so on, made an excellent interpretation, revealing a lot of ordinary people aware of the meaning of difficult. The history of exchanges between Chinese and foreign literature and foreign literature and comparative studies, a comprehensive study, also carried out up to this period, and the emergence of people like Chen Yinke, Qian Zhongshu like everyone. 
<br>
<br> (G) to grasp the object in the study, there are also more comprehensive, pioneering in the fields made many achievements. For the history of literature of all periods of literature, very few omissions, such as the Liao, Jin, Yuan literature, has always been ignored. And this time went so far as popular commentators note, only 1934 years, the Commercial Press, which published two books of the study, the authors of a Wu Mei ( "Literary History of the Liao, Jin Yuan"), one for the SU Xue-lin ( "Liao, Jin and Yuan Literature "). For a variety of different types of miscellaneous body of literature studies, and very few ignored. This period novels, drama study has already been present a splendid sight, needless to say; In addition, a variety of folk literature and 
<br> Learning is like ancient myths, folklore, stories, Foqu, storytelling, Gu Ci and so on, all kinds of essays body, such as travelogues, diaries, Poetry, words words, notes and other studies have also started to varying degrees. In which the study of myth, such as Shen Yanbing, Gu Jiegang of folklore studies, Zheng Zhenduo pairs of all kinds of "popular literature" studies are all made pioneering achievements. 
<br>
<br> Summarized above are essentially four points before the deepening of the performance of three points compared with the performance of diversity. In short, research concepts and methods of deepening, diversification, which means the gradual modernization of steady discipline matures, is the period of study of classical literature in a major feature. 
<br>
<br> The period of study of classical literature is characterized by the second largest establishment of historical materialism. Historical Materialism in the 54 was introduced to China during the i.e., Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu all, has written many articles, expounded its major purpose and as Lee's relegated to "re on the problem and doctrine" (1919), "Historical Thought Lecture" (1920 years) and so on. Historical Materialism spread rapidly in 20 years, many intellectuals are subject to varying degrees, even Ting Wen-chiang, Hu these "science activists," "experimentalist" also slightly Ruran. However, the use of historical materialism in-depth study of ancient history and literature, but as late as 1928 really made some progress. Lu Xun and the Creation Society that year, the Sun Society debate on the revolution in literature, so that both sides to make progress in literary theory, toward the direction of historical materialism. However, on classical literature, the two sides are both too busy to address. Kuo Mo-jo Yuanbi at a time when the Japanese, but because the objective circumstances, is the study of Chinese ancient history, his "study of ancient Chinese society," a book completed (1928-1929 years), made him the first to be used for historical materialism science and the first person to classical literature. By the readme: "This book can be said is that the nature of Engels's" Family, Private Property and the State, "the sequel. Research methodology is based on him as guide, but in what he knew the Indians of the Americas, Europe, ancient Greece, Rome, the offer came out the word that he has not referred to the ancient Chinese. "〔2〕 book, the use of historical materialism, the productivity of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, the relations of production made a study and submit a slave society, said the Western Zhou Dynasty. , "Book of History," "The Book of Songs" as the main research historical book is also the object of study, the author of historical materialism reading "Book of Songs", dig out a lot of our predecessors could not recognize the meaning of this is "Book of Songs" research in the history of a major breakthrough in the history of Chinese classical literature a major breakthrough in research. Since then, the materialist conception of history in three to four decades on behalf of a rapidly developing field of classical literature. 
<br>
<br> Historical Materialism into the study of classical literature, to the research work has brought new weather. Specifically manifested as follows: For the occurrence and development of ancient literature, from the socio-<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Economic">Economic</a>   and class relations, to search for the inevitable reasons, do not know these, but know why they are; for the ancient writers and their works to the class relations in accordance with prevailing circumstances, the use of method of class analysis to make a historic value judgment, to avoid the abstract ethical concepts with which to look at the ancients; for the change in literature and the evolution of the <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Economic">Economic</a>   base and superstructure from the relationship between the <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b78">Law</a>   of social development of historical materialism proceeding, to be unifying and grasp, to sum up the development of the internal laws of classical literature. These advantages or strengths, is the evolutionary history of literature and any other literary history are not available. Three to four decades on behalf of the classical literature, researchers, and many people in their efforts to learn and apply historical materialism to make their achievements. However, chronological, the situation will vary accordingly. Generally speaking, 30 years is to create stage, although some success has been achieved, but still noticeable without careful consideration; while 40 years later the improved maturity. In this regard, they only need to Tan Pi-Mo, "Outline History of Chinese Literature" and Liu Jie, "History of Chinese Literature," On a clear understanding can be. TAN was published in 1933, for the early literary history of the masterpiece of historical materialism. The book entirely on the social history of the development stage of historical materialism and the doctrine of class struggle as the key link, to set up chapters, such as the second chapter of the chapter heading as "primitive feudal era literature", which consists of three sub-sections, programs are "feudal The establishment of the system, "" a reflection of aristocratic life, "" a reflection of life of the peasants, "the book are generally true. This can not but a bit formulaic, conceptualization, the author is not a phenomenon from the study of <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b110">Ancient Literature</a>   to draw some kind of regularity things, but rather the laws of <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b110">Ancient Literature</a>   to the ready-installed into different categories inside. Liu Jie, "History of Chinese Literature," written in 1939 on a volume, published in 1941, the next volume written in 1943, published in 1949, can represent 40 age level. Liu with the same implement the materialist conception of history, the book of ancient Chinese society, the nature, stage and class relations, has generally taken the Marxist historians of into that, but for the complexities of literary development, but also to give adequate attention to efforts to to clarify the inherent laws of literature itself, which discusses both the theory with historical materialism, but also accurately analyzed the "flow of goods, very mixed," the history of the actual situation, to overcome the drawbacks of the simplified, showing a strong persuasive. Liu Jie advantage of the literary history of more than that, but in this regard, has been showing the public for more than one chip. It can be said, to 40 years, historical materialism in the study of classical literature in the use of giants in the initial stage of maturity. 
<br>
<br> This period of cultural and educational development, the number of the National University have added a lot more than the previous period, publishing <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Industry">Industry</a>   has also continued to grow, especially the 30's, for the publication of the most prosperous period of the old China. In this context, classical literature, the number of workers increased over the previous period, but also emerged a group of outstanding researcher, a new generation of research at home is the most representative Chen Yinke, Kuo Mo-jo, Zheng Zhenduo, Wen Yi-duo, Qian Zhongshu, Liu Jie their character and style of different scholarly research, expertise is also different, but have demonstrated broad knowledge, rich experience, rich in talent, creativity, academic personality prominent characteristics. Their overall achievements may not be more than the previous period of academic masters such as Wang Guowei, Lu Xun, Hu Shi and so on, but the character of a statement on the study will no doubt be more distinctive characteristics of modern technology. This is also with the whole nature of the academic stage of development associated with the. 
<br>
<br> Three 
<br> 3rd period study of classical literature from the period of diversification into unification. A unified direction is the Marxist historical materialism. 
<br>
<br> 1949, in Chinese history is turned upside down the year, the Chinese people's democratic dictatorship led by the Communist Party of birth as a nation, China's political, economic, cultural, dramatic changes have taken place. Academic thinking on the words and then entered a period of world domination by historical materialism. Including the study of classical literature, including the social - human science research, be incorporated into a unified democratic and socialist cultural construction. On how to deal with cultural heritage, Mao Tse-tung already developed such a policy: China's long feudal society, they created the splendid ancient culture. Clean-up the development process of ancient culture, to reject its feudal dross to absorb its democratic essence is the development of national culture to increase the national self-confidence necessary conditions;, but must not be non-critically eclectic. Must be the ancient decadent feudal ruling class in all things and the wonderful people of the ancient culture that is democratic and revolutionary with a number of things distinguished. 〔3〕 in this section on the classical writers with well-known, but the text in this section, before Mao Zedong also raised another point, namely: "must not be any reactionary idealism a united front. Communists can be a Idealists and even some religious believers and <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Political">Political</a>   action based on a united front against imperialism and feudalism, but it must not agree with their idealism or religious teachings. "〔4〕 In fact, this latter point is the conceptual premise, it is important . While the actual situation in 1949, and is precisely the one hand, the party and the government advocacy, classical literature and doing "clean up" work, on the other hand, under the leadership of the party and the government to carry out the process with a critical idealism. Intertwined with these two areas is almost carried out. As the former is the daily work in general, the latter often a critical way the movement, so the latter is much greater. Reposted elsewhere in the <a href="http://eng.hi138.com">paper for free download</a>  
<br>
<br>
<br> This period a total of nearly 30 years, almost regularly in the movement and its criticism of being a brief pause. These critical movements and struggles, almost all affected study of classical literature, classical literature and some were directly in the field of study commence. Mao Tse-tung was also put forward a "hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools contend" approach, including the "Art on the different forms and styles are free to develop, science and different schools of thought are free to argue," 〔5〕 that the content of academic freedom. However, in practice, due to frequent criticism of the movement, here called "free discussion" is not possible; on the contrary, the non-academic <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Political">Political</a>   criticism is often the method used to solve. 
<br>
<br> Against this background, classical literature, researchers can do is to strive to transform thinking, critical idealism, to establish historical materialism, to adapt to new social demands. Even so done, and sometimes are not immune from criticism, because criticism does not actually limited to the conceptual idealism, there are many other factors can make the concept of non-classical literature, workers become target of the criticism. During the period of nearly 30 years time span, the study of the effectiveness of the classical literature and critical movement is inversely proportional to the level of tension: the early 50s is better, the late 50's poor, the early 60s for three years due to natural disasters, critical movement temporarily break, cultural and academic environment, a little relaxed, classical literature have performed slightly better, but the renewed campaign in late 1963, and intensified, direct transition to the Cultural Revolution. Normal research simply can not expand, the whole subject in a cancellation of state, time of up to 10 years. 
<br>
<br> Nevertheless, the period of study of classical literature has achieved a lot of achievements. These achievements are mainly four aspects: 
<br>
<br> (A) the popularization of knowledge of classical literature. In the early '50s, the Government has called attention to the succession of national cultural heritage, including the revival of opera here, and local opera, attention and development of <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Chinese+medicine">Chinese medicine</a>   industry, but also include the compilation and universal excellence of ancient literary heritage. To this end, "People's Daily" has published an editorial, "literary heritage" It was at that time as "Guangming Daily" supplement founded. At that time the national cadres and young students to learn classical literature, the air is quite strong.In this context, there has been compile classical literature books and trends in this50Early age60Early age, resulting in a number of quality
<br>Higher anthology. These anthologies in layman's language, both for the readers to accept, but also reflects the considerable academic standards were a great influence on the essence of classical literature and spread to the masses is indeed unprecedented, contributed. 
<br>
<br> (B)古代文学史real and <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Information">Information</a>   collation and research. Some researchers have put effort in this regard, Fen their talents, but also made a number of accomplishments. Mainly due to historical work, their ideas and concepts involved in fewer problems, Yi Gu mechanical materialism by the extreme left, vulgar sociological impact is small, its academic quality, but better way to ensure, as compiled by Zheng Zhenduo hosted such "ancient in this drama series "(1-5 series), Peking University, Department of Chinese History of Chinese Literature <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b211">teaching</a>   and Research compiled the" History of Pre-Qin Literature Reference "," Han history of literature references "," Wei-reference literary history, "Zhong Hua Book Company published a set of" study of classical literature compilation of <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Information">Information</a>   "(including" Tao Volume "," Bai Ju-yi Volume "," Fan Chengda Yang Wanli Volume "," Lu Volume ", etc.), edited by Guo Shao-yu," Chinese History Literary Theory Choice "(upper, middle and lower ), and so on. These works, because of their rich source of material, effectively Xiangming, both as a tool of reference books or research, are quite available, can be said that the infrastructure in academic subjects there are building blocks of power. 
<br>
<br> (C) for some discussion of academic issues, understanding has been deepened. At50Age as well as the60Early on in the field of classical literature, a number of issues have been discussions. The general starting point for discussion is how to apply the Marxist historical materialism to understand and evaluate the classical literature. The issues discussed, some theoretical and stronger, such as the criticism on the literary heritage of the question of succession, on the <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b110">Ancient Literature</a>   of realism and romanticism question about the history of the <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b78">Law</a>   of development of Chinese literature question about the "middle piece" of the availability of and evaluation, on the ancient literature of patriotism, and so on. Some problems are more specific, such as on the Cai Yan and the "胡笳十八拍" discussions, comments on Cao Zhi's discussion of the issue on the discussion of Tao Yuan-ming evaluation on the discussion of Border Poets of the Tang Dynasty, on the "Everlasting Regret" evaluation discussion on the evaluation LiYu discussion on Li Qingzhao evaluation discussion on the "Pipa" discussion of the issue, and so on. Through these discussions, the understanding of the issues, somewhat in depth. However, due to the prevailing ideological and theoretical environment "Left" tendencies are quite evident, so these academic problems occurred inevitably during the discussion of the "Left" deviation; Also, because the "left" the stronger the tendency of the more backward, so they are discussed later, academic nature is gradually fading, while the ideological criticism and even <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Political">Political</a>   criticism of the color even more dense. In those theoretical issues, especially strong, such as on the critical question of succession literary heritage, it is a theory, a discipline problem,50Age there are some serious discussion, but to date1963、1964Years, it has become almost an ideological and political issues, academic discussion has become the ideological and political criticism. 
<br>
<br> (D) the preparation of the history of literature.50Late, with the national "Great Leap Forward" synchronized, once the history of the rise of the preparation of the upsurge of Chinese literature, while also launched on the literary history of the laws of development discussions. During the discussion, for the "realism and anti-realism is the literary history of the struggle against the law," "folklore, the mainstream theory" and other colors with the mechanical materialism, the argument has been overcome, Qifang's paper, "Literary History of the discussion Several issues "(1959年6訪ong ┚ higher than was  NAO  annoying Lu Yu Fang Shi Yu condyle miscellaneous loose vent argon  stop  Tao Zhao Zhuo Yin Fu Fu mountain peak stems   fierce provincial disaster  ∩ T deceive the cries of the Greek?0年代?bran mash   Stanford talk straight wren take along saddle blanket lack of noise feeding   Po Chun oval vent а г How difficult to make a sound core g   vent blowing hard  &#289; t U II-VI II-VI has ordered  who lectures difficult to recite the  Xing Shuo    had raised marsh  Otsuka  color submarine mortar forced flatter Public Key restrain crude saltpeter  wholesale Fang Shao  left   member Ranxia Metaplexis stauntoni Hoang K.

<br>
<br>The period of discipline personnel, in general can be divided into two parts. Part of the liberation from the previous period, that is over, they are mostly university teachers, editors and other professional workers, and some is already a well-known professors, excellent classical literature specialist. Into this period of time, one hand, they work and daily life get better placement, on the other hand is considered "old intellectuals", a long-term transformation of an object. Although there were clear policy: "the bourgeoisie and those who have served the old society of intellectuals, many of the people always stubbornly express themselves, always nostalgia of their old world, for the New World there is always out of tune. To transform them to take a very long time, but is not a crude approach "〔6range Huan  scold  lying Shuo  school? They are seldom are not subject to criticism and the impact of one kind or another of them "many people" is actually quite sincere efforts to transform themselves, but in "a very long time", the "Always "is not recognized until the70Age is also known as the "no transformation of a good bourgeois intellectuals." A little comparison can be found, and many crossed the previous period and the period of classical literature experts, two periods in the number of research there was a significant difference in the previous period less the current period. Of course, it is not their initial efforts and current dredging lazy lazy writing is really thinking of pressure and the movement has been frequent, affecting their focus on engaging in professional research. While a number of outstanding experts prime, but have yielded few results, and even sign off in a semi-state, which is a waste of amazing talent, people sighed with regret! 
<br>
<br>Another part of personnel trained during the youth-oriented scholars (50Age of college graduates, to this end of the period have also not young), thanks to1949Years later, the great development of education, this part of a larger number of people. Although they younger, in the new educational system for many years accepted the <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Education">Education</a>   of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, but then they still were classified as "out from the old schools to help students" still transforming world outlook, must continue to participate in " labor training "and" accepted the workers, re-<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Education">Education</a>   "and therefore the majority of them, there are no small feeling of burden. This part of the classical literature, there is no shortage of talented scholars who, but structural weaknesses in knowledge, mainly knowledge cramped, professional basis was not sufficiently deep and generally poor foreign language proficiency can not be compared with the older generation of scholars; while some were also subjected to the times The atmosphere he argued, formed with the simplistic thinking to examine the issue of historical materialism inertia, a simple class analysis to cope with the complex issues of literary history. Existence of these problems, to improve their level of research is not a small resistance to the formation of this era dictates, the non-personal of the blame also. 
<br>
<br>This period has a more prominent researcher of classical literature is a can not fail to mention, he is Qifang. During the period of discipline against the backdrop of a unified, Qifang respect for history and the attitude and the spirit of seeking truth from facts, made some very bold remarks. For instance, he said: "In the history of literature, in the sympathy between the people and against the people, in a clear and obvious progress between the reactionary, as well as with a large number of intermediate work." 〔7 〕 He discussed the typical problems Shihai repeatedly emphasized that "typical class character is not equal to" 〔8ield? Blowing trade Falcon chu? He always strive to historical materialism and class analysis among the flexibility and seek a middle ground. He also frequently discuss issues in a number of occasions, act as "correct" the role of extreme leftist ideology; in some he made with the "official color" of the report, has also always stressed on the literary heritage of the pragmatic attitude, as he did in China Writers on the Third Report of the Board "a correct attitude toward heritage, the creation of a new era of literature" (1960Years), with regard to the main space, criticizing some of the "bias" and "biased" in the "left" the main thing. To this end, he often some people heading for the "right" representatives of the attack. Qifang classical literature research in order to "On" Dream of Red Mansions "" (1956Years) the heaviest weight. This is a long9虲lam value Mu basket mold  Department of shoot-yun Yu  irresolute Kong ㄖ ? Article comprehensively discusses the "Dream of Red Mansions" and ideological significance, artistic value, analysis of characters depicted in the book focus on the complex nature of evaluation of its presence in China literary history and the world literary status. Article carrying out the <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b52">Basic theory</a>   of historical materialism and ideological, but the arguments are rigorous, practical, but also pointed out that "Dream of Red Mansions" in blending his mouth, "a profound humanitarian spirit", indicating his special theory of flexible sex. This is precisely where his research personality. During the period of "Dream of Red Mansions" research works, "On the" Dream of Red Mansions "," reached at the time to reach the highest level, so valuable. 
<br>
<br> Four 
<br>The fourth period is subject diversified development period. The so-called diversity refers to the Marxist historical materialism have been re-understanding and interpretation of the concept of establishing it as a rightful place in the social sciences; the same time, those who exemplify the characteristics of the humanities and other various academic concepts and methods, have also been a corresponding respect and absorbed, so that the discipline of study forms, and truly reflect the "Art on the different forms and styles are free to develop, science and different schools of thought are free to argue," and actually implement "hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools contend" policy. The total period20Years, but also before and after roughly be divided into two phases. Refers to pre -1985Years ago, refers to a later stage1985Years later. Shorter the previous stage, can be summed up as "order out of chaos" stage, which actually means to diversify the preparation phase; phase longer, can be said officially entered the "diversification" stage. 
<br>
<br>The field of classical literature, "order out of chaos", 蔆owardly callosum  not Fou smothering laugh  down &#289;?976Year "Cultural Revolution" ended,1978Years of the party and the country's political line, a major change, ultra-leftist line were to be liquidated, the introduction of reform and opening up policy. In this context, academic and cultural vitality of the cause of re-sprouting, classical literature is also a new life after years of Xiao Xie. First, in quantitative terms, has been restored. With1977Year university to <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b156">Resume</a>   enrollment, classical literature and re-identified as an important foundation of Chinese, curriculum, <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b211">teaching</a>   and research in classical literature, the recovery and expansion teams stepped up.1980"The literary heritage" to revive the form of magazines, has a certain symbolic significance. Since then, study of classical literature began to track, the important nature of the subject was again established. 褺ook pack?980Years later, though, when compared with neighboring disciplines, classical literature also began to set up various societies, through these institutes, horizontal linkages among scholars has been enhanced, the research team regroup, academic activities are sequential start. Across the country organized by the classical literature there are a certain scale symposium, an annual total10Or more times. The international academic exchange activities, including the request to come in, go out and have also begun. In such circumstances, a corresponding increase in research, publishing books and academic papers published in the number of surge. 
<br>
<br>Qualitative situation is even more worthy of attention. This stage of the work done, first of all is the previous period, especially the "Cultural Revolution" for clearance on all kinds of fallacies, including the theory of conceptual as well as specific comments on the literary phenomenon. In theory, such as on the nature of literary heritage, and how inheritance literary heritage, Criticism and inheritance relations, how should we regard the ancient writer's progress and limitations, how to evaluate their contribution to the literature, how to carry out research in classical literature, history, doctrine, how to use class analysis method, classical literature and research studies on the nature and role of the literary heritage of research and the "four modernizations" of the relationship, and so on. Comment on specific aspects of literary phenomena, are involved in a number of writers in the history of the literary works of some former period was stronger with the wrong conclusions and assertions, this stage has to be corrected, this is for the ancients, "rehabilitated." Such as those on Li Bai and Du Fu, "Dream of Red Mansions" problem, "Water Margin", and so on, a number of obvious mistakes, ill-founded claims, were 11 negative discarded. This problem more specific, but also are more "Cultural Revolution" Seventeen years ago and the "Cultural Revolution" in the legacy, at this stage almost all articles, 11 of them clean-up. Order out of chaos on one side also includes some of the criticism of what happened during the campaign to re-evaluate, such as the1954Years on "Dream of Red Mansions study" critical movement, "literary heritage", "Literary Criticism" and other magazines have published articles, made a realistic and objective historical review comments, for which non-merits and demerits of the analysis, comparison is convinced. Things right results, on the one hand to eliminate all sorts of fallacies and disadvantages of remaining clean-up of the subjects, "the foundation" so that research can begin at a high starting point; but also the broad masses of workers from the classical literature, a period of "a unified discipline "ideological bondage freed, in order to prepare the diversified development of discipline and mentality of the ideological and theoretical preparation. 
<br>
<br>Diversified development of classical literature, probably from the80The mid-decade, and its course of development has not been easy, but there are setbacks and reversals. But generally speaking, still moved forward, to90The late near the end of the century amid a wide range of patterns could be said to have generally been determined. This pattern of the connotation is: 
<br>
<br> (A) After re-interpretation of historical materialism, is still the study of classical literature, a basic concept. After several years of historical materialism at this time, "order out of chaos" has largely eliminated the mechanical materialism and vulgar sociological ills, thereby radiating a new vitality. This "new" materialist conception of history has the advantage that it generates in the interpretation of literature, literature, the basic nature of the evolution of literature, literary characteristics of the times, the relationship between literature and class struggle, writers, literary activities and the relationship between social environment connection, still has a strong, irreplaceable role; same time, it no longer has a closed, rigid, and extremely conceited, and exclusive features, but has an open character, can flexibly deal with the relationship between the doctrines of other schools, be able to co-exist with other schools of thought doctrine is compatible with. 
<br>
<br> (B) The theory of human nature has quietly returned the areas of the humanities. Theory of human nature, human feelings, said, humanitarian, humanist, of those "people"-based ideas, this is a human life and emotions and reflect the performance, with ultra-era S &amp; P pan-sexual. Literature in this objective human existence, it will naturally rise to literary studies in the theory of human nature. Academic history in this century, there have been many times destroy the human nature of the fighting, such as the20Late30By Lu Xun in command early against the new humanist scholar Liang Shih-chiu's theory of human nature of the criticism40Under the auspices of the early era of Mao Zedong's theory of human nature on the criticism of literary and art circles in Yenan,50年代60Critical age movement, but also involved in repeated theory of human nature problem, "Cultural Revolution" is not human nature a little remaining room for maneuver. The reason why human nature is difficult to fight, because in fact the existence of humanity. Perhaps this reasoning is too common normal, so80The era of the revival of human nature, had not made any momentum, even a declaration of Haozhuang no, it just quietly sneak in, soon infected almost every classical literature researcher. Infected with the severity of different light will be it as a supplement to historical materialism, while those as heavy as the basic concepts to re-examine the ancient Chinese literature, where scholars, starting from the theory of human nature to rewrite history of Chinese literature. It is human nature's own unique advantages, especially in the analytical understanding of the creative intent and inner meaning, writers, spiritual personality, as well as the spread and impact of literature and so on. In short, today's end of the century, the classical literature, researchers have at least no longer deny human nature, human feelings, as to whether it as a study of the basic concepts, varies among people. In terms of research on the between the lines disclosed in the relevant statement of human nature, they have been everywhere all that, too numerous to mention. The materialist conception of history and human nature and use complementary and seems to have become the most popular classical literature and the research community approach. 
<br>
<br> (C) the introduction of the modern theory of ideology. Modernist theory as early as the first and second period of this century, has entered China, and in the academic and creative community, occurred in a certain role, such as symbolism, aestheticism, expressionism, Schopenhauer theory, Freud's theory, etc. . Almost all of the 54 writers in varying degrees during the contact with these ideological doctrine, and in his own creative work reflects this. For example, Freud's theory, when the impact of a very wide and it was brought contemplation of Chinese classical literature, Kuo Mo-jo once in order to psychoanalytic theory, criticized "The West Chamber" and other classics, said: "The spirit of the analysis scholars to sexual life The origin of defects for all literature and art, and perhaps there have been when the place; contingent, such as the rare Chinese works of literature such as "Songs of the South", such as "胡笳十八拍" such as "brocade palindrome poem," such as Wang Shih-fu The film, "The West Chamber", I think that with this description can be "〔9ield 5 to intimidate  acetabular Lan Yi Chen  forced to steal the mass graves? Modernist ideology and theory as a "bourgeois reactionary doctrine", in China there is no room for existence, so80Age comeback to make a lot of people will feel strange. Also to Freud's theory, for example, has been brought at this time applied to study of classical literature, such as that "ancient poetry as Jiao Zhongqing wife as" mother of unwarranted persecution of coke abuse Liu Lanzhi is due to the "love child complex" because the blue Chi's character behavior, even from the feudal <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b150">Ethics</a>   to measure, but also impeccable, is a perfect daughter-, coke-<a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b78">Law</a>   mother-drive when not given us any reason, we can only mother a widow from the coke to analyze the psychological and so on ; can not say that there is a certain truth. Modernist theory applies to classical literature, and its development prospects and performance assessment, will take some time. 
<br>
<br> (D) the introduction of post-modernist theory. These are strange things, including structuralism, reception aesthetics, new formalist criticism, archetypal criticism, Expressionism, Surrealism and so on. These theories of contemporary literary theory and criticism, the impact is fairly large, become a fashionable literary trend. In the classical literature research, occasionally some commentators use "reception aesthetics", "text study" theory of interpretation of ancient Chinese literature, there is a substantial new ideas, Kai human thinking; natural systems has not yet formed, and some blunt, and in the ways and means of thinking with the a great distance from the traditional method, so for the majority of peers have not yet accepted a limited impact. 
<br>
<br> (E) the introduction of new contemporary scientific theories. This in system theory, <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Information">Information</a>   theory, control theory, the most representative. The present is the development of natural sciences and technological sciences seventies and eighties of this century, put forward new ideas, on behalf of the contemporary science of the universe and human self-awareness of new developments. They are for promoting the development of modern science is undoubtedly of great significance. Some knowledge will introduce them to come in. Some people even try to study classical Chinese literature, and pretty well-open field of vision, honesty more than the so-called multi-Wen Yi.1986、1987Published a number of relevant articles and books in this area, in the classical literature, notably during the research community, but after unsustainable, few humanitarian and. Comes and goes too fast is also reason for fear is an objective as a humanities studies of ancient Chinese literature, and huge differences exist between the contemporary natural science, the nature of the object in different disciplines, academic concepts and methods is difficult to simply transplant GM, want to communicate with two types of distant subjects, it would need the next larger and more effort; subjectively, while those who do not have opened up on the natural and human sciences knowledge bedrock, people of non-generalists and to pass on, not be difficult to peace! 
<br>
<br> (Vi) the expansion of disciplines and open up. This is the most striking phenomena of this period. Designated for the prison to break the practice truly reflects the spirit of openness, will open up this subject with other disciplines, which is transforming physical discipline, an important measure to enhance the level of discipline. From80Since the mid-decade, the classical literature has been gradually integrating concepts and methods of other disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, folklore, ethnology, mythology, religion, psychology, linguistics and so on. This greatly broadens the study of vision and add new research tools, and for the subjects to open up a lot of marginal study. In particular, the study of <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b138">Cultural Studies</a>   perspective the establishment of the discipline has brought to the new atmosphere. <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b138">Cultural Studies</a>   is characterized by a wide coverage, strong integrity, the classical literary studies and <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?b138">Cultural Studies</a>   of "marriage" so that the discipline to avoid confined to one corner for closure of isolated studies; but also offers more to this subject see the result of large small or because of the possibility of Seeing. In short, so that study of classical literature toward "mastery" direction. 
<br>
<br>The period of discipline personnel status, age level can be divided into three categories. The first major category for the second period of this century (1949Years ago) grew up in talent group, no matter known as the "old generation of scholars." They enter this period of advanced age, most of them have reached seventy years of age, but gradually Zhe Yi Xie a lot of those surviving to the end of the century has been limited. They have outstanding scholastic ability bedrock and rich experience, scholarship and become the discipline of the "people's fancy." Them to a ripe old age, still fulfill promises, pose forever, and reproduction of academic glory. One Qian Zhongshu, Cheng Qian-fan serves as the representative. Qian thick multi-year plot-based writing Huang Huang Ju volumes of "tube cone-made", and the paper "Poetry Can Complain" and so on. "Tube cone compiled" had a still "Tan Yi Lu," runs through the only clue Ze Yi Qin, "Poems", "book", philosophers, as well as strict or are "full" and so the pattern is more near Gaoyou Wang, "Reading Magazine" . The book further develop their ancient and modern and refined, Western linking, knowledgeable, wise Keisaku academic style, showing the spirit of the old and the indemnity health. Qian two academic masterpiece, respectively, resulting in the second period of this century, and the fourth period, including a rather symbolic that the academic spirit of this period, in essence, with three to four decades on behalf of the echoes. Ching is also a variety of works of this period come out, such as "Literary History of the Song Dynasty," "Man on the 10笺", "is a poem to open up the world" and so on, in the older generation of scholars is very strong; and Ching also Tuition preaching full advantage of the scholars in nurturing the younger generation to pay painstaking efforts, and achieved remarkable success, since the80Since the mid-decade, subglottic talent, with a strong academic "echelon" in the discipline in the widely praised praise. 
<br>
<br>The second largest category for the fifties or sixties grew up talent group, regardless of call "in the generation of scholars" (in fact they have to be90Multi-age have been his sixtieth session). The characteristics of this generation of scholars has been, such as mentioned above, as subjects in human resources constitute an integral part of their role of linking in this period took on the historic task. Set things right in the first half of this period, primarily on by them to do, this is a major achievement; the latter half of the subjects diversified construction, they also participated in a most of the work, while in training a new generation of talent, they work is also up. As for this period a number of major disciplinary projects, they also serve as the design plan and chairing. Can be seen "in a generation" is the main force during the development of academic disciplines. Of course, some of them in the way of thinking and knowledge structure, there is a "subject unification" brought about a number of limitations period for the subject development can not help but have some impact. Specifically manifested as follows: Although this period of reform and opening up era, has greatly improved the academic environment, academic achievements and progress are obvious to all, but the results point of view, as seem to be more mediocrity of some, with the previous generation Master and outstanding academic research comparable homes generous, big production, was almost non-, and in the creation of distinctive academic schools, it seems quite backward. Here are many reasons, academic mechanisms are still problems with room for improvement, but the quality talent no doubt has a lot to. 
<br>
<br>The third largest category of growing up during the talent-oriented groups, regardless of known as "Green generation of scholars" (in fact80Early graduate students, there are some people to the end of the century has been over attitude to life). This generation in order out of chaos and the creation of multi-cultural atmosphere to grow, the traditional inherited the burden of light, so ways of thinking that has greater openness, knowledge structure has also been improved, in particular,90Age-educated talent, and lighter for their age, traditions inherited fewer, more contemporary-type personality, active thinking, grasp of contemporary academic thought fast, strong desire and innovative ideas, creativity stronger. 
<br>Furthermore, they have a good degree in foreign languages, which will help to understand the information and overseas scholars to make comparative studies. Although they are engaged in interdisciplinary work time is not long, but has shown considerable ability to get a lot of results. But they also exist a number of weaknesses, above all, outstanding deep-solid professional basis, the current <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Education">Education</a>   system determines when to enter their postgraduate professional training in disciplines (this is the same as the previous generation), which is no doubt a bit too late. In addition, there a considerable number of people is not enough Specializes in academic psychology, was born in the market economy era, the number of contaminated some market mentality, by affecting the interests or the quick buck, or next to the greedy too much, or for external purposes and want early results, more results, more less concerned about the cultivation of inner knowledge and accumulation, which is prone to impulsive style. 
<br>
<br>To the present time period Although access to academic diversity, reflect the more recent nature of the research results are also more than ever before, but look at the academic history, still with a certain transitional in nature. Yi Gu until the end of the century yet to see the academic master appeared, this is the era of regret. 
<br>
<br>Century classical literature research and development four times for the sequential phase, ups and downs, twists and changeable, but generally speaking, times are moving on, the subject has also been improved and enhanced. We can be proud of this century is the Chinese for thousands of years the greatest achievements of this discipline century, the disciplines of modern <a href="http://eng.hi138.com/?k=Technology">Technology</a>   in this century have been basically achieved within, and produced many excellent results have emerged in many places, and outstanding academic masters study at home. This is what we20Century, the common glory of the classical writers, but also left a rich legacy of the next century.
