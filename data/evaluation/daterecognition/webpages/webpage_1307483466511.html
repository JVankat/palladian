In fact, as the New Republic&#039;s  Jonathan Chait  and the Spectator&#039;s  Alex Massie  pointed out, back in the 1980&#039;s, King was very openly friendly with and supportive of some terrorists, specifically the Irish Republican Army. From a New York Sun article that Chait linked to:  
   
He forged links with leaders of the IRA and Sinn Fein in Ireland, and in America he hooked up with Irish Northern Aid, known as Noraid, a New York based group that the American, British, and Irish governments often accused of funneling guns and money to the IRA. At a time when the IRA&#039;s murder of Lord Mountbatten and its fierce bombing campaign in Britain and Ireland persuaded most American politicians to shun IRA-support groups, Mr. King displayed no such inhibitions ....
King&#039;s support for the IRA was unequivocal. In 1982, for instance, he told a pro-IRA rally in Nassau County: &quot;We must pledge ourselves to support those brave men and women who this very moment are carrying forth the struggle against British imperialism in the streets of Belfast and Derry.&quot;
By the mid-1980s, the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic were openly hostile to Mr. King. On one occasion, a judge threw him out of a Belfast courtroom during the murder trial of IRA men because, in the judge&#039;s view, &quot;he was an obvious collaborator with the IRA.&quot; When he attended other trials, the police singled him out for thorough body searches.
     
Considering how vocal King is on terror policy in his role as ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, it&#039;s rather amazing this doesn&#039;t come up more often. Frankly, I didn&#039;t know about it before this. But it really should be part of any discussions involving his frequent criticisms and his stance on counterterrorism generally.

												<b>Democrats aren&#039;t dead yet</b><br/>
						<i>01/06/2010</i><br/>
						 
At the White House Wednesday, press secretary Robert Gibbs wasn&#039;t about to play political prophet.  
&quot;Look, it is hard to look into the crystal ball 11 months from Election Day,&quot; Gibbs said. Hard -- and also, if you&#039;re a Democrat these days, a little scary. The surprising news Tuesday night that Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., wouldn&#039;t run again was followed not long afterward by the slightly less surprising news that his Connecticut counterpart Chris Dodd would join him in retirement. Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter announced his retirement, too, and just for good measure, Michigan Lt. Gov. John Cherry said he would sit out the 2010 election as well. Republicans and the media alike declared the sky was falling for the Obama administration and the Democratic Party.  
&quot;The real question is whether Harry Reid, now the Senate&#039;s most vulnerable Democrat, will follow Chris Dodd&#039;s lead and step aside,&quot; Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said in a statement. (Take this one to Vegas, in Reid&#039;s home state -- he won&#039;t.)  
Clear away the overheated rhetoric, though, and the reality in Washington looks a little different. Sure, Democrats will struggle in November&#039;s elections -- which they were already going to do anyway. The timing is bad, because all the retirement announcements stacked up on top of each other. So the &quot;optics,&quot; as political operatives say, are terrible. But the Democrats aren&#039;t actually in substantially worse shape Wednesday than they were Monday.  
Take Connecticut. Dodd may be a beloved member of the Senate Democratic caucus, but there was almost no way he was going to win another term. His ill-fated move to Iowa during the 2008 presidential primaries, his sweetheart mortgage deal from Countrywide and his work to enable AIG to issue bonuses despite billions of dollars in federal aid left him the most endangered incumbent senator in either party. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, though, entered the campaign Wednesday with  at least a 30 point lead  over his GOP opponents, according to  one poll taken before Dodd bowed out .  
&quot;Let&#039;s get real here,&quot; one Senate Democratic leadership aide told Salon. &quot;We had a huge problem, and now it&#039;s gone.&quot;  
With Blumenthal in much better shape than Dodd, the party won&#039;t have to devote anywhere near as much money to holding Connecticut as it might have otherwise. Buying ads in the state means buying ads on New York television; Democrats say the cash they&#039;ll save in Connecticut could help out in races in Ohio, Missouri or Kentucky.  
North Dakota is a little different. Dorgan gave no advance warning to any of his colleagues (and barely any to his staff, informing aides  by e-mail  just before he announced his decision), and his departure doesn&#039;t relieve any pressure on the Democratic majority. But it&#039;s not entirely clear he would have won another term, anyway. There was persistent speculation Wednesday among Senate insiders that North Dakota&#039;s Republican Gov. John Hoeven had tipped Dorgan off over the holidays that he would get into the race, and that Dorgan opted out as a result. A  poll taken just before Christmas  showed Hoeven beating Dorgan easily. Of course, now the seat is a virtual lock for the GOP to pick up, even if Hoeven stays out, but Republicans might have won it no matter what. (Dorgan, for his part, said in his retirement announcement that he would have held on if he&#039;d run.)  
Colorado, where Ritter was deeply unpopular, may turn out to be better for the Democrats after Tuesday, as well. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar could run for the job, or Andrew Romanoff, who&#039;s challenging Democratic Sen. Michael Bennett in a primary, could switch to the governor&#039;s race.  
And as Democrats were forced to point out repeatedly Wednesday, even after the retirement announcements, there are more Republicans who won&#039;t run for their seats this year than Democrats. Already, 14 House Republicans have declared they won&#039;t seek another term, compared to only 10 Democrats. (Some are seeking higher office.) Six Senate Republicans, compared to only four Democrats, are stepping down. And four Republican governors will retire this year, joined by three Democrats.  
Again, none of this means Democrats are eagerly awaiting the elections right now. Things were bound to be tough for the party that controls the White House, the House and the Senate during a midterm election, especially if the economy doesn&#039;t improve. But the map hasn&#039;t fundamentally changed, no matter what you hear on TV.

												<b>Poll: With Dodd&#039;s exit, Dems better off in Connecticut</b><br/>
						<i>01/06/2010</i><br/>
						 
Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., might not have won reelection if he hadn&#039;t opted to announce his retirement Wednesday. But state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, the favorite to take Dodd&#039;s place as the Democratic nominee for the seat, appears to be in a much better position. According to one poll conducted just before Dodd&#039;s announcement, if the election were held today, Blumenthal would win in a landslide against any of his potential Republican opponents.  
The survey -- conducted by a Democratic firm, Public Policy Polling -- shows Blumenthal leading former Rep. Rob Simmons 59-28. And that&#039;s the  closest  any of the three Republicans come to the attorney general. According to PPP, Blumenthal would beat World Wrestling Entertainment executive Linda McMahon 60-28 and would crush Peter Schiff, who&#039;s best known as an economics advisor to Ron Paul, by a full 40 percentage points, 63-23.  
At least some of this is due to the fact that Blumenthal is popular, or at least tolerated, across party lines in Connecticut. PPP&#039;s poll showed that a slight plurality of Republicans, 37 percent, have a favorable opinion of him, compared with 35 percent who don&#039;t. And in  a Quinnipiac University poll  conducted last year, fully 70 percent of Republican respondents said they approve of the job he&#039;s been doing as attorney general.

												<b>Holocaust museum shooter Von Brunn dies</b><br/>
						<i>01/06/2010</i><br/>
						 
James Von Brunn, the white supremacist accused of shooting and killing a guard at the Holocaust museum earlier this year, has died, the Associated Press reports. He was 89.  
Von Brunn was wounded during the June attack, but had survived those injuries; it&#039;s not yet clear if they played a role in his death or whether his chronic medical problems and age were to blame. Initial reports had Von Brunn dying at the prison hospital where he was being held, but a spokeswoman for the prison said he was pronounced dead at a local hospital in North Carolina.  
For more on Von Brunn and his long, disturbing history with white supremacy, see Salon&#039;s previous coverage of him and the shooting  here.   
 Update:  The Holocaust museum put out this statement in the wake of Von Brunn&#039;s death:  
   
The Museum&#8217;s thoughts and prayers continue to be with Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns&#8217; family at this time. Officer Johns died heroically defending the Museum, visitors and staff. This tragedy is a powerful reminder that our cause of fighting hatred remains more urgent than ever.

												<b>Emotional Dodd: &quot;None of us is irreplaceable&quot;</b><br/>
						<i>01/06/2010</i><br/>
						 
At a press conference he held Wednesday afternoon to discuss his decision not to run for reelection after almost 30 years in the Senate, Connecticut Democrat Chris Dodd couldn&#039;t hold back his emotion. Choking up at times, Dodd talked about why he&#039;d decided to retire -- the likelihood of a loss hadn&#039;t played a role, he claimed, though he did at least acknowledge the difficult race he would have faced -- especially some of the things he&#039;s faced over the past year.  
&quot;Over the past 12 months, I&#039;ve managed four major pieces of legislation through the United States Congress, served as chair and acting chair of two major Senate committees, placing me at the center of the two most important issues of our time: health care and reform of financial services,&quot; Dodd said. &quot;I lost a beloved sister in July, and in August Ted Kennedy. I battled cancer over the summer. And in the midst of all of this found myself in the toughest political shape of my career.&quot;  
But, he added, &quot;None of these events nor circumstances, either individually or collectively, is the cause of my decision not to seek reelection. Yet together these challenges have given me pause to take stock and to ask questions that too few of us in elected public life ever do: Why am I running?&quot;  
Dodd also spoke of traveling to Arlington Cemetery and the grave of Sen. Ted Kennedy after the Senate voted on healthcare reform, an issue dear to Kennedy&#039;s heart, the day before Christmas, saying he thought about his career, constituents and colleagues. And from there, he went on to say, &quot;I have been a Connecticut senator for 30 years. I&#039;m very proud of the job I&#039;ve done and the results delivered. But none of us is irreplaceable. None of us are indispensable.&quot;

												<b>The sad, inevitable return of Harold Ford</b><br/>
						<i>01/06/2010</i><br/>
						 
Some politicians, you can tell, just want it too badly. John Edwards, for one, has often betrayed that kind of impatient ambition. Another character in this mold is Harold Ford, Jr. The former Tennessee congressman and Democratic Senate candidate has always seemed just a little too hungry.  
That feeling won&#039;t exactly be allayed by the news that he&#8217;s seriously considering running again for U.S. Senate -- this time, in New York, where he now lives. The New York Times  reports  that appointed Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand &quot;has yet to win over key constituencies,&quot; leaving an opening for a primary challenge. Ford, who is close to major Democratic financiers like Steve Rattner, is considering trying to capitalize on this opportunity.  
New Yorkers, the Times points out, have been amenable in the past to voting for recent transplants. But it&#8217;s hard to imagine Ford following in the footsteps of Bobby Kennedy and Hillary Clinton. First of all, Gillibrand herself was considered an excessively conservative pick, and has spent the last year running leftward to forestall a primary challenge. She&#8217;s flipped her positions on  gay marriage  and  immigration . In other words, if she&#8217;s vulnerable anywhere, it&#8217;s on her left. That&#8217;s what the Times means when it says she&#8217;s having trouble nailing down key constituencies.  
Ford, on the other hand, last ran for office in Tennessee, four years ago. His campaign was characterized mainly by ostentatious Blue Dog gestures like  pretending  that he didn&#8217;t know what the word &#8220;cerebral&#8221; meant, and  shooting an ad  in the pews of a church (Script: &quot;I voted for the PATRIOT Act, $5 trillion in defense, and against amnesty for illegals.&quot;) Simply put, this guy is going to have a really hard time getting to Gillibrand&#8217;s left in time to win a Democratic primary in one of the most liberal states in the country.  
And that&#8217;s to say nothing of what he&#8217;s been doing since he lost his Senate bid in 2006. Ford took up the chairmanship of the Democratic Leadership Council, the group made famous in the 1990s for fueling Bill Clinton&#8217;s centrist challenge to the party&#8217;s liberal interest groups. Since about 2003, however, the DLC&#8217;s name has been mud with Democratic primary voters, as the group almost invariably urged the party to accommodate then-President Bush&#8217;s proposals. After leaving Tennessee, Ford also started work as a vice chairman at Merrill Lynch. That will surely go over well.  
Still, there&#039;s something a little tragic about Ford.&#160;A congressman&#8217;s son, he went to Washington&#8217;s ultra-prestigious St. Albans for school, and was obviously groomed for power; he did a radio spot for one of his dad&#8217;s campaigns, demanding better schools, better housing and &quot;lower cookie prices.&quot; Once he was grown, he was hailed as the up-and-comer to watch. He was elected to Congress at age 26. As a young, handsome centrist Democrat who was considered electable statewide and gave the keynote at the 2000 Democratic convention, he was the best bet for the first black president up until about five years ago. People magazine even named him one of its sexiest men of the year. Now it just seems the nicest thing anyone could do for Ford is tell him when to call it a day.

												<b>Colorado Gov. Ritter won&#039;t run for reelection</b><br/>
						<i>01/06/2010</i><br/>
						 
The past four years have been a rollercoaster ride for Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter. First elected in 2006 with a 15 percentage point margin, Ritter, a Democrat, is now  expected  to announce Wednesday that he will drop out of a reelection race he looked likely to lose.  
Like  the news  that Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., won&#039;t be running again, this is one retirement announcement that Democrats won&#039;t be losing much sleep over. Ritter&#039;s exit from the race clears the way for strong potential candidates like Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper or Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to run.  
The state itself has been a key target for Democrats in the past few elections, and it has paid off for them, part of a general blue-ing of the Mountain West that&#039;s happened as Latinos have become a bigger voting bloc in the region. In 2004, Democrats picked up one of the state&#039;s Senate seats, along with a House seat; in 2006, Ritter took the governor&#039;s mansion for his party, which also gained another House seat. And in 2008, the importance the party puts on Colorado was on display when Denver was chosen as the site for the Democratic National Convention. The decision appeared to pay off when the state gave its electoral college votes to Barack Obama, who won there by nine percentage points just four years after John Kerry lost Colorado by five points, and when Democrats flipped the second Senate seat and yet another House district.  
This year, though, has looked like tougher going for Colorado Democrats. Ritter&#039;s exit may make things easier, but Republicans are looking to knock off Sen. Michael Bennet, who was appointed by Ritter after Obama named Salazar to his Cabinet, and they&#039;re likely to make it a competitive race.

												<b>Connecticut Sen. Dodd retiring</b><br/>
						<i>01/06/2010</i><br/>
						 
Looks like Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., will have some company in  his retirement :&#160;Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., will reportedly announce later Wednesday that he&#039;s not seeking reelection after almost 30 years in the Senate.  
On the surface, these retirements might both look bad for Democrats, but the situations are actually quite different. Dorgan&#039;s decision not to run again means the party is likely to lose a seat it had a good shot at holding, but Dodd&#039;s is actually good news, electorally, for the Democratic Party.  
Connecticut&#039;s a blue enough state that, theoretically, a Democrat running for Senate in it should be the heavy favorite. (Joe Lieberman is, of course, a special case, but just remember -- there are reasons he hasn&#039;t just become a Republican, and this is one of them.)&#160;But despite his long career in the Senate, Dodd was going to face a tough fight this year due to his own personal issues, mainly stemming from his chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee: He&#039;s been hit hard by reports of a loan he got through a VIP&#160;program at Countrywide Financial, his involvement in the bailouts and questions about a vacation home he owns in Ireland.  
State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is  expected  to announce -- at a press conference that will follow Dodd&#039;s by only half an hour -- that he&#039;ll be seeking the Democratic nomination in the incumbent&#039;s place. A veteran of statewide Connecticut politics, Blumenthal will immediately become the front-runner in the race.

					<span>
												<b>Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., retiring</b><br/>
						<i>01/05/2010</i><br/>
						 
With this year&#039;s midterm elections coming up fast, political observers are paying ever more attention to the inevitable wave of retirement announcements now coming on both sides. One big retirement was just announced: Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., won&#039;t be running for reelection this year.  
&quot;Although I still have a passion for public service and enjoy my work in the Senate, I have other interests and I have other things I would like to pursue outside of public life,&quot; Dorgan said in a statement. He also named several possible factors as not contributing to his decision: It &quot;does not relate to any dissatisfaction that I have about serving in the Senate,&quot; Dorgan said, and it &quot;has no relationship to the prospect of a difficult election contest this year.&quot; After the latter, he added, &quot;Frankly, I think if I had decided to run for another term in the Senate I would be reelected.&quot;  
Whether or not he&#039;s telling the truth about the role that the difficulty -- or lack thereof -- of a race this year played in his decision, it is true that Dorgan might well have faced a tough fight. Early polls from both  Rasmussen  and  Zogby  (along with one commissioned  by the National Republican Senatorial Committee , for what it&#039;s worth) had Dorgan trailing badly behind Gov. John Hoeven, a Republican. The question has been whether Hoeven even wants the job. He was approached to run in 2006 against Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad, but didn&#039;t, and has been delaying a decision about this year. Now, though, the seat looks like a likely Republican pickup, even if someone besides Hoeven ends up being the GOP&#039;s nominee.  
More from Dorgan&#039;s statement:  
   
&#160;
For the past year, I have been making plans to seek another six-year Senate term in next year&#8217;s election. Those plans included raising campaign funds and doing the organizing necessary to wage a successful campaign.
&#160;
Even as I have done that, in recent months I began to wrestle with the question of whether making a commitment to serve in the Senate seven more years (next year plus a new six-year term) was the right thing to do.
I have been serving as an elected official in our state for many years. Beginning at age 26, I served ten years as State Tax Commissioner followed by thirty years in the U.S. Congress by the end of 2010. It has been a long and wonderful career made possible by the people of North Dakota. And I am forever grateful to them for the opportunity.
&#160;
Although I still have a passion for public service and enjoy my work in the Senate, I have other interests and I have other things I would like to pursue outside of public life. I have written two books and have an invitation from a publisher to write two more books. I would like to do some teaching and would also like to work on energy policy in the private sector.
&#160;
So, over this holiday season, I have come to the conclusion, with the support of my family, that I will not be seeking another term in the U.S. Senate in 2010. It is a hard decision to make after thirty years in the Congress, but I believe it is the right time for me to pursue these other interests.
&#160;
Let me be clear that this decision does not relate to any dissatisfaction that I have about serving in the Senate. Yes, I wish there was less rancor and more bipartisanship in the U.S. Senate these days. But still, it is a great privilege to serve and I have the utmost respect for all of the men and women with whom I serve ....
Further, my decision has no relationship to the prospect of a difficult election contest this year. Frankly, I think if I had decided to run for another term in the Senate I would be reelected.
&#160;
But I feel that after serving 30 years, I want to make time for some other priorities. And making a commitment to serve in the Senate for the next seven years does not seem like the right decision for me.
So, 2010 will be my last year in the Senate. I will continue to work hard for the best interests of our state and country during this coming year. We need to get the economic engine restarted and put people back to work. We need to reform our financial system to make sure that which happened to cause this deep recession will not happen again. And we need to get our fiscal and budget policies under control. The federal budget deficits are not sustainable.
&#160;
But even as we face all of these difficult issues, I am convinced that our country will rise to the challenge.
&#160;
We are a great nation. And I have a deep sense of optimism about the future of our country.
     
Dorgan has been in the Senate since 1992.

												<b>Obama: Christmas attack due to failure to analyze intelligence</b><br/>
						<i>01/05/2010</i><br/>
						 
On Tuesday afternoon, President Obama&#039;s focus was again on the attempted Christmas Day terror attack on Northwest Flight 253. The president met with his national security team to discuss the reviews that have been in progress ever since the failed bombing, and then once again spoke about what happened and what his administration is doing in an attempt to plug various security holes.  
As he did once before, Obama took a tough line on the failures within the U.S. government that allowed Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to enter the country by air with a bomb strapped to his crotch.  
&quot;The bottom line is this: The U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncovered this plot and potentially disrupt the Christmas Day attack, but our intelligence community failed to connect those dots, which would have placed the suspect on the no-fly list,&quot; Obama said.  
&quot;In other words, this was not a failure to collect intelligence, it was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already had. The information was there, agencies and analysts who needed it had access to it, and our professionals were trained to look for it and to bring it all together. I will accept that intelligence by its nature is imperfect, but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged. That&#039;s not acceptable, and I will not tolerate it.&quot;  
Obama also addressed the detention facility at Guant&#225;namo Bay, noting, &quot;Some have suggested that the events on Christmas Day should cause us to revisit the decision to close the prison at Guant&#225;namo Bay.&quot; He referred to the decision to cease transferring detainees to Yemen, then added, &quot;But make no mistake. We will close Guant&#225;namo prison, which has damaged our national security interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for al-Qaida. In fact, that was an explicit rationale for the formation of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. And as I&#039;ve always said, we will do so -- we will close the prison in a manner that keeps the American people safe and secure.&quot;

												<b>Obama suspends transfer of detainees to Yemen</b><br/>
						<i>01/05/2010</i><br/>
						 
Since the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 on Christmas, the Obama administration has been getting some pressure about the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. Much of that pressure has focused on transfers of those detainees to Yemen, where the suspect in the bombing had been and where some former detainees suspected of involvement in the attack had previously been sent.  
President Obama heard from both sides of the aisle about the issue. Sens. Lindsey Graham, Joe Lieberman and John McCain joining to write one letter urging him not to send one group of detainees to Yemen, though it turned out the six people in question had already been transferred. And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee called Yemen &quot;too unstable&quot; to host former detainees.  
Now, the administration has  decided  to halt, at least temporarily, the movement of any detainees from Guantanamo to Yemen.  
We are not going to make decisions about transfers that, to a country like Yemen that would, that they&#039;re not capable of handling. And I think that, while we remain committed to closing the facility, the determination has been made that right now any additional transfers to Yemen is not a good idea,&quot; White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday.

						<i>01/05/2010</i><br/>
						 
There&#039;s been a fair amount of talk recently about disaffection in President Obama&#039;s liberal base. Opinion-makers on the left  were up in arms  over the president&#039;s decision to send additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan. Even more of them have been slamming him over healthcare reform, especially the death of the public option and his apparent failure to do much, if anything, to try to save it.  
For now, though, it doesn&#039;t seem as if those critics have had much effect on the opinion of most liberal Democrats. In  an article  for the National Journal, Pollster.com&#039;s Mark Blumenthal makes a convincing case based on polling that there&#039;s not really any evidence of a larger backlash against Obama:  
   
While Obama&#039;s [Gallup approval] rating has declined across the political spectrum, nearly nine out of 10 liberal Democrats -- an average of 87 percent in December -- approve of the job Obama is doing as president.
While Obama&#039;s numbers have declined modestly among liberal Democrats since last April (from 95 percent to 87 percent), the declines have been more pronounced among conservative Democrats, moderate to liberal Republicans and &quot;pure independents&quot; (those who do not &quot;lean&quot; to either party) ....
Among liberal Democrats, the ABC/Post poll found a decline in strong approval from 78 percent in the first three months of the Obama presidency to 69 percent over the last three. A decline, to be sure, but at least two-thirds of liberal Democrats still say they strongly approve of the job Obama is doing as president.

												<b>In war over GOP, right wins battle in Florida</b><br/>
						<i>01/05/2010</i><br/>
						 
This year, Florida will be a key battleground in the war over the direction of the Republican Party. Gov. Charlie Crist, a moderate who&#039;s been very popular, was supposed to cruise to victory in the race for an open Senate seat, but he&#039;s been facing a surprisingly tough opponent on his right flank in the form of one-time state House Speaker Marco Rubio. And on Tuesday, Crist lost a big battle.  
Jim Greer, the chair of the state GOP, is a close ally of Crist&#039;s. But he&#039;s been facing pressure for some time now over party finances and hsi involvement with contested primaries, especially the governor&#039;s. Rubio&#039;s people have spent some time calling for his ouster.  
Now, they&#039;ve gotten it:&#160;Greer is  reportedly  resigning from his post.

												<b>Steele not exactly firing up the troops</b><br/>
						<i>01/05/2010</i><br/>
						 
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele has a new book out. And, as always for Steele, an opportunity for self-promotion is also an opportunity to go way off message.  
Steele was plugging his book on Sean Hannity&#039;s show on Fox News Monday night. Hannity wanted to hear some predictions about Republican prospects in this year&#039;s midterm elections, which led to this conversation:  
   
HANNITY: I think this is one of the most important mid-term elections that, as I said earlier, in our lifetime. So here&#039;s my -- I&#039;m going to put you on record in January, and I&#039;m going to play this back to you in November.
STEELE: Okay, I&#039;m there.
HANNITY: Predictions for the election.
STEELE: Predictions for the election. I think that overall -- and we&#039;re beginning now to do the assessments on the various races. But I think overall, given what we know so far and what this administration&#039;s proclivities are, we&#039;re going to see, I think, nice pick-ups in the House. I think we&#039;re going to see --
HANNITY: More specific.
STEELE: Well, I can&#039;t give a number yet, because, like I said, we&#039;re just now beginning to look at the races. And we have races where it hasn&#039;t been declared --
HANNITY: Do you think you could take over the House? Do you think Republicans --
STEELE: Not this year. And Sean, I&#039;ll say honestly --
HANNITY: You don&#039;t think so.
STEELE: Well, I don&#039;t yet, because I don&#039;t know who all the candidates -- we still have some vacancies that need to get filled. But then the question we need to ask ourselves is, if we do that, are we ready?
     
You do have to give Steele some points for honesty here. But boy, as campaign strategy, this is pretty bad. Telling voters they won&#039;t reach their goal isn&#039;t a great way to bring them out to the polls. Take this Republican-infused metaphor for example: Imagine if &quot;win one for the Gipper&quot;&#160;became, &quot;I&#160;wish we could win this one for the Gipper, but we probably won&#039;t, because we&#039;re not ready.&quot; Not really the most motivational speech ever.

												<b>Fox&#039;s Hume digs in deeper on Woods comments</b><br/>
						<i>01/05/2010</i><br/>
						 
When Fox News&#039; Brit Hume told Tiger Woods, &quot;Tiger, turn to the Christian faith and you can make a total recovery and be a great example to the world,&quot; he wasn&#039;t proselytizing. At least, that&#039;s what he said Monday night, when he discussed those comments with his network&#039;s Bill O&#039;Reilly.  
The exchange between O&#039;Reilly and Hume on the subject:  
   
O&#039;REILLY: Was that proselytizing?
HUME: I don&#039;t think so. I mean, look, Tiger Woods is somebody I&#039;ve always rooted for as a golfer and as a man. I greatly admired him over the years, and I always have said to people it was the content of his character that made him, beyond his extraordinary golf skills, so admirable.
Now we know that the content of his character was not what we thought it was. He is paying a frightful price for these revelations. I - - my sense is that he has basically lost his family, and there&#039;s a lot of talk about the endorsements he&#039;s lost. But that pales, I suspect, in his mind, with what he&#039;s lost otherwise. And my sense about Tiger is that he needs something that Christianity, especially provides and gives and offers. And that is redemption and forgiveness.
And I was -- I was really meaning to say in those comments yesterday more about Christianity than I was about anything else. I mentioned the Buddhism only because his mother is a Buddhist and he has apparently said that he is a Buddhist. I&#039;m not sure how seriously he practices that. But I think -- I think that the -- Jesus Christ offers Tiger Woods something that Tiger Woods badly needs.
O&#039;REILLY: Now, if he does go that route, then he would be accused of -- remember in the Bill Clinton years, he got in trouble, he had the Bible and Jesse Jackson and they were praying and, you know, wouldn&#039;t Americans...
HUME: That&#039;s true, Bill. That wouldn&#039;t -- and that wasn&#039;t the first time. Remember Chuck Colson, who is one of the leading lights of Watergates, if you will.
O&#039;REILLY: But he made a true conversion.
HUME: He did. And I&#039;m -- what I&#039;m saying is if Tiger Woods were to make a true conversion, we would know it. It would show through in his -- in his being, and he would know it, above all. And he would feel the extraordinary blessing that that would be. And -- and it would shine because he is so prominent. It would be -- it would be a shining light, and I think it would be a -- it would be a magnificent thing to witness.
O&#039;REILLY: Now, what kind of reaction did you get when you said that? A lot of letters and e-mails and things?
HUME: I got some letters and e-mails from people who were like me, who are believers who said, &quot;Great. Right on. Right on. Way to go.&quot; I&#039;ve heard a lot of terrible comments from people who claim that I was a pompous jerk who had no business mouthing off on the subject and that I shouldn&#039;t have belittled the Buddhist faith and so on. I really wasn&#039;t trying to belittle and demean.
O&#039;REILLY: I don&#039;t think so either. What drives -- what do you think drives the negative comments about -- Buddhism aside, I don&#039;t think we&#039;re trying to denigrate Buddhism. But what do you think drives the negative comments about Christianity?
HUME: It has always been a puzzling thing to me. The Bible even speaks of it, that, you know, you speak the name, &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; and I don&#039;t -- and I don&#039;t mean to make a pun here, but all hell breaks loose. And -- and it has always been thus. It is explosive. I didn&#039;t even say the name in that way. I simply spoke of the Christian faith. But that was enough to trigger this reaction. It triggers a very powerful reaction in people who do not share the faith and who do not believe in it.
     
I&#039;m fairly sure the reaction to Hume -- at least from what I&#039;ve seen, and I  looked at quite a bit of it  Monday -- has much more to do with the &quot;pompous jerk&quot; part than with the mere mention of Christianity. But maybe Hume believes the opposite; even if he doesn&#039;t, it certainly plays with O&#039;Reilly&#039;s audience. And for Hume to say he wasn&#039;t proselytizing is absurd -- as Steve Benen  points out , what he did is the dictionary definition of the word.

												<b>A day of progress for LGBT community</b><br/>
						<i>01/04/2010</i><br/>
						 
All in all, Monday was a pretty good day for the LGBT&#160;community. Despite the reason the Obama administration has given gay activists to be upset, the administration made two fairly significant moves to the benefit of the community. And Texas&#039; biggest city swore in a lesbian as mayor.  
President Obama actually  named  Amanda Simpson as a senior technical advisor to the Commerce Department before Monday, but the news that Simpson is transgendered and serves on the board of directors of the National Center for Transgender Equality just came out. Similarly, a decades-old ban that kept those infected with HIV&#160;or AIDS&#160;from traveling to the U.S. was  lifted  on Monday.  
Finally, Houston got a new mayor, Annise Parker.  According to  the Houston Chronicle, Parker is &quot;the first openly gay woman elected mayor of a major American city.&quot;

												<b>Limbaugh&#039;s accidental support for health reform</b><br/>
						<i>01/04/2010</i><br/>
						 
Even a brief hospitalization for chest pains isn&#039;t the kind of thing that stops Rush Limbaugh from being, well, Rush Limbaugh. Once he was released, the conservative talker told reporters, &quot;Based on what happened to me here, I don&#039;t think there is one thing wrong with the American healthcare system. It is working just fine, just dandy.&quot;  
Well, yeah -- there&#039;s nothing wrong with the system for people like Limbaugh, who either get coverage from an employer or can easily afford to pay for even the costliest of individual plans. Limbaugh is very clearly not the kind of person reform is intended to aid, and he presumably knows that, but a little thing like that hasn&#039;t ever stopped him before.  
That aside, though, there was something really notable in Limbaugh&#039;s comments:&#160;As a few liberals -- including some who work for the Service Employees International Union, a consevative bogeyman -- are now gleefully  pointing out , Hawaii&#039;s healthcare system is different from the one in the continental U.S. In fact, it&#039;s much more liberal, and some elements are actually pretty similar to provisions in Democrats&#039; reform bills. Plus, as the SEIU  noted , the state&#039;s medical workers are heavily unionized.

					A third party crasher at state dinner

												<b>A third party crasher at state dinner</b><br/>
						<i>01/04/2010</i><br/>
						 
Apparently Tareq and Michaele Salahi weren&#039;t the only uninvited guests to attend the state dinner at the White House last November. The Secret Service  announced  Monday that there was a third, as-yet-unidentified, crasher.  
There&#039;s reportedly an ongoing criminal investigation into the matter. But so far, the Secret Service says &quot;there is nothing to indicate that this individual went through the receiving line&quot; or that he or she met the Obamas, as the Salahis did.  
The State Department is getting blamed for the security lapse, as the third crasher apparently came with the Indian delegation (the dinner was in honor of the country&#039;s prime minister). Of course, there are still going to be questions about how tight security at the White House really is -- and, unfortunately, this probably means even more stories about the Salahis, whose 15 minutes really should have been up by now.

												<b>Fox&#039;s Hume slammed for telling Tiger to convert</b><br/>
						<i>01/04/2010</i><br/>
						 
When you&#039;re a celebrity, everyone seems to know how you should best run your life -- and they&#039;re not shy about offering advice on that score, publicly. Take Tiger Woods, whose dirty laundry has been very public recently in the wake of revelations about his extramarital affairs. On Sunday, Fox News&#039;&#160;Brit Hume decided to tell Woods how he can get things back on track:  
   
Tiger Woods will recover as a golfer. Whether he can recover as a person, I think, is a very open question. And it&#039;s a tragic situation ... But the Tiger Woods that emerges once the news value dies out of this scandal, the extent to which he can recover, seems to me to depend on his faith.
He&#039;s said to be a Buddhist. I don&#039;t think that faith offers the kind of forgiveness and redemption that is offered by the Christian faith. So my message to Tiger would be, &quot;Tiger, turn to the Christian faith and you can make a total recovery and be a great example to the world.&quot;
     
The reaction to Hume&#039;s comments has been largely negative.  
&quot;I do not understand and can&#8217;t begin to comprehend the arrogance it takes to publicly anoint yourself someone&#8217;s spiritual adviser, and to then lecture them about their faith and its alleged inadequacies,&quot; the Atlanta Journal-Constitution&#039;s Jay Bookman  wrote.  &quot; A person&#8217;s faith is a private matter between that person and God, and is not a matter to be judged by some pompous TV anchor.&quot;  
The Atlantic&#039;s Andrew Sullivan was similarly critical,  writing :  
   
The pure sectarianism of this comment -- its adoption of the once-secular stage of political journalism to insert a call for apostasy -- is striking ... But it has long been established that non-evangelical Christians have at best an auxiliary role in today&#039;s religiously defined GOP, and the slow morphing of Fox News into the 700 Club is not exactly new ... Once you have abolished the distinction between secular and religious discourse, as they routinely insist on doing, their politics is their religion and their religion is their politics. And both are corrupted.
     
And Steve Benen  chimed in  to make a few good points, &quot;It&#039;s hard to even know where to start with something like this. How many high-profile Christians have had damaging sex scandals of late? Why is Buddhism deemed inadequate for those with family problems? Why is a senior political analyst for a so-called &#039;news&#039; network proselytizing, on the air, during one of the network&#039;s &#039;news&#039; programs?&quot;  
As of this post, a spokeswoman for Fox News hadn&#039;t yet responded to a voice mail Salon left seeking comment. But there were some conservatives in the blogosphere who came to Hume&#039;s defense.  
&quot;Leftists in the state-run media are lambasting Brit Hume for promoting Christianity on a Sunday morning talk show,&quot; the Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft,  complained , before going on to make a somewhat nonsensical argument in response to Benen: &quot;It used to be that liberals didn&#8217;t want you to mention Christ in schools. Then they banned Christ from Christmas concerts and public squares. Now they are demanding that we not talk about Christianity in public. We should have seen this coming.&quot;

It&#8217;s hard to blame Michelle Obama for not wanting to return from her family&#8217;s Hawaii vacation to Washington this week. It&#8217;s 26 degrees in the capital right now, and that&#8217;s to say nothing of the fairly frozen political climate. But did the first lady take her reluctance too far in a comment she made this morning? A frightened nation demands answers.  
Speaking to the traveling press corps, Obama  suggested , &#8220;Let&#039;s stay! Are we all in? I&#039;m trying to mount a coup here!&#8221;  
Presumably there are now a few dozen mass e-mails circulating about how the first lady is a self-acknowledged fascist, whose main intellectual hero is Mussolini.

        Arnold Schwarzenegger hits the right note</b><br/>
						<i>01/07/2010</i><br/>
						The governor offers intriguing ideas on prison versus higher-education spending and for scaling back pensions in his last State of the State address.
                          
                    
                    
                        Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&#039;s final State of the State speech was his best. The budget proposal he&#039;ll send the Legislature on Friday almost certainly will be his worst.
