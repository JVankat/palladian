				<p>2007 is turning out to be a terrible year for the music industry. Or rather, a terrible year for the the music <em>labels</em>.</p>
<p>The DRM walls are <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/02/emi-apple-are-announcing-sale-of-non-drm-music/">crumbling</a>. Music CD sales continue to <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/21/good-news-cd-music-sales-down-20-from-2006/">plummet rather alarmingly</a>. Artists like Prince and Nine Inch Nails are flouting their labels and either <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-06-29-prince-giveaway_N.htm">giving music away</a> or telling their fans to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ5iHaV0dP4">steal it</a>. Another blow earlier this week: Radiohead, which is no longer controlled by their label, Capitol Records, put their new digital album <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com">on sale</a> on the Internet for <a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1666973,00.html">whatever price</a> people want to pay for it.</p>
<p>The economics of recorded music are fairly simple. Marginal production costs are zero: Like software, it doesn&#8217;t cost anything to produce another digital copy that is just as good as the original as soon as the first copy exists, and anyone can create those copies (meaning there is perfect competition and zero barriers to entry). Unless effective  legal (copyright), technical (DRM) or other artificial impediments to production can be created, simple economic theory dictates that the price of music, like its marginal cost, must also fall to zero as more &#8220;competitors&#8221; (in this case, listeners who copy) enter the market. The evidence is unmistakable already. In April 2007 the benchmark price for a DRM-free song was <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/02/emi-apple-are-announcing-sale-of-non-drm-music/">$1.29</a>. Today <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/25/game-on-a-real-alternative-to-itunes/">it is $0.89</a>, a drop of 31% in just six months.</p>
<p>P2P networks just exacerbate the problem (or opportunity) further, giving people a way to speed up the process of creating free copies almost to the point of being ridiculous. Today, a billion or so songs are downloaded monthly via BitTorrent, mostly illegally.</p>
<p>Eventually, unless governments are willing to take drastic measures to protect the industry (such as a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/19/replacing-drm-with-a-music-tax-is-incredibly-stupid/">mandatory music tax</a>), economic theory will win out and the price of music will fall towards zero.</p>
<p>When the industry finally capitulates and realizes that they can no longer charge a meaningful amount of money for digital recorded music, a lot of good things can happen.</p>
<p>First, other revenue sources can and will be exploited, particularly live music, merchandise and limited edition physical copies of music. The signs are already there &#8211; the live music industry is <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/yearend/2006/touring/index.jsp">booming</a> this year, and Radiohead is releasing a special edition box set of their new album for £40.00 simultaneous to the release of their &#8220;free&#8221; digital album.</p>
<p>Second, artists and labels will stop thinking of digital music as a source of revenue and start thinking about it as a way to market their real products. Users will be encouraged (even paid, as radio stations are today) to download, listen to and share music. Passionate users who download music from the Internet and share it with others will become the most important customers, not targets for ridiculous lawsuits.</p>
<p>The price of music will likely not fall in the near term to absolutely zero. Charging any price at all requires the use of credit cards and their minimum fees of $0.20 or more per transaction, for example. And services like iTunes and Amazon can continue to charge something for quality of service. With P2P networks you don&#8217;t really know what you are getting until you download it. It could, for example, be a virus. Or a poor quality copy. Many users will be willing to pay to avoid those hassles. But as long as BitTorrent exists, or simple music search engines like <a href="http://skreemr.com/">Skreemr</a> allow users to find and download virtually any song in seconds, they won&#8217;t be able to charge much.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> There are some <a href="http://www.coolfer.com/blog/archives/2007/10/out_come_the_ar.php">blog</a> <a href="http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/card/archives/2007/10/armchair_econom.html">responses</a> to this post that are, inevitably, complaining about fairness. Arguing against basic economics makes about as much sense as arguing against gravity. Zero marginal cost + competition (anyone can create a copy of a song) results in a zero price, unless government creates artificial barriers to a free market.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2: </strong>NBC Universal chief <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i298d60247271e2fe0f4896122dae6158">Jeff Zucker</a>: &#8220;We need, across the board, to move IP enforcement up the agenda of the federal government.&#8221; Scary stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> <a href="http://www.profy.com/2007/10/04/techcrunchs-founder-says-recorded-music-to-eventually-be-free-heres-why-hes-wrong/">Paul Glazowski </a>writes a rebuttal, essentially arguing from the fairness perspective. I talk about the fairness argument in the comments below a lot. As I say below, gravity may not be fair, either, but its inevitable. Paul also says the medium has &#8220;value,&#8221; which I don&#8217;t dispute. But the fact is that zero marginal production cost plus perfect competition (every consumer is also a potential producer of any song) inevitably equals a zero price. I think Paul&#8217;s main point is, even though he doesn&#8217;t say it, that government should step in and set a &#8220;fair&#8221; price of $5 &#8211; $8 per album. Of course, that will involve getting the feds involved to enforce these laws (see update 2 above), or some kind of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/19/replacing-drm-with-a-music-tax-is-incredibly-stupid/">music tax</a> (which creates really, really bad incentives).</p>
<p><strong>Update 4:</strong> The discussion below is awesome. I think I&#8217;d like to do a podcast or video debate with someone who disagrees strongly. <a href="http://www.profy.com/2007/10/04/techcrunchs-founder-says-recorded-music-to-eventually-be-free-heres-why-hes-wrong/">Paul Glazowski</a>, mentioned in the third update above, seems to disagree strongly and intelligently and may be willing. If there are any pro-label types out there, I&#8217;d be happy to consider them as well. Let me know. Perhaps we could get Scoble or Gillmor to video this for us, too.</p>

<p>Its models like IMEEM that are the future of the web. Even as Ballmer stated with Microsoft &#8211; people are willing to accept advertising if it means the product will be free. In the article I read, he suggests that 25% of revenue in the next 5 years at Microsoft will come from ad-funded ventures.</p>
<p>The sooner the music labels release that DRM is dead and that money will now flow from streaming live concerts with advertising, t-shirt sales and the concerts themselves the better.</p>
<p>Even attempting to charge ridiculous prices for Internet Radio seems pointless as sooner or later Last.fm/Pandora will incorporate streaming advertising technology. I just find it stupid &#8211; havent the labels heard of stream ripping ? If not, maybe they need to look this up and read more about it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the curse of Guitar Center. Now everyone has access to good inexpensive instruments and recording equipment. Alot of older guys have set up man cave&#8217;s that ten years ago would have been decent professional production studios. Incredible software like Fruity Loops and ProTools allow for very good production for peanuts. The point is, everybody is creating and playing music. It&#8217;s just harder and harder to build and maintain a loyal audience that&#8217;s willing to pay anything for music. Promotion is critical. That&#8217;s why I believe music podcasts will become very useful promotion tools for musicians.</p>
<p>Video podcasts can show performances, interviews, backstage footage, outtakes, etc. You can also offer PDF&#8217;s of song lyrics, marketing pieces, gig dates, etc. The reason for podcasts rather than streaming video is because of the RSS. That is the critical element. Get your fans to sign up for the rss feed and then keep pushing out the content to them. Quincy Jones and Elvis Costello are examples of (already established) musicians using podcasts effectively.</p>

There are millions of people who would download for free albums by artists they would pay up to a hundred bucks to see live.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably buy Radiohead&#8217;s new album for five or ten bucks (hopefully 95% profit for Yorke and the guys)&#8230;  but if I drive down to the Shoreline to see them live I&#8217;ll end up paying thirty to eighty dollars.</p>
<p>The byproduct of this, I hope, is that people will get more interested in local music.  Right now, it&#8217;s a chore for most bands to bring anybody (besides friends and family) out to a show, and the better venues have a pretty harsh chicken and egg policy in terms of letting new bands in (you cannot play shows unless you can bring 100 people, you can not build up a fan base until you&#8217;ve played shows!).</p>
<p>If this can create a push for a larger emphasis on live shows, which creates a demand for national headliners to bring in more local openers, that could encourage people to go see the locals when they headline shows, thus exposing them to even more local bands and hopefully turning them into people who are fans of local music in general instead of just specific bands.</p>
<p>I know this is TechCrunch and we&#8217;re supposed to be takling about Web 2.0 and Facebook, but while we&#8217;re talking about music I figured I&#8217;d share my experiences.</p>

<p>I think what&#8217;s actually quite ironic about Bittorrent is how professional and well-done most rips are. This is especially true in the TV arena, where full-season, commercial-free, HD rips of shows are available everywhere. Forget viruses, the torrents actually offer a better quality product than what the networks charge an arm and a leg for.</p>

<p>You cannot short-circuit the process of building a fanbase by using high tech methods.  Local bands generally develop their initial followings based on the personal connections they can make with their audience thanks to the intimacy of local shows.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a Bay Area band called Maldroid that has spent hundreds of hours making video podcasts and music videos and putting together and flashy web site.  Chances are, you&#8217;ve never heard of them.  The video content is really good, but the real problem is that people don&#8217;t care about local music unless it can lean out from the stage and touch them (in a non-dirty way).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that takes the kind of ballsy, constant in-person interaction that most artists and bands wish they could avoid.  They do so, and rely instead on podcasts, web sites, and video content, at their peril.</p>

<p>The music industry is built entirely around the selling of recorded music in one format or another.  Merchandise is sold to offset costs of touring.  Touring offsets costs of videos and other promotional efforts.  If those efforts are successful, and if the music sells, the first thing those sales offset are the recording costs.  Once those are offset, along with all other &#8220;administrative&#8221; costs such as representation fees or distribution costs, the artists start making money.  In other words, the model dictates that there are no net profits from any revenue stream other than the actual and eventual selling of the music.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what has folks in the business up in arms.  For the most part, they&#8217;ve never made money on any of those other &#8220;real products&#8221; and now everyone is trying to figure out how.</p>
<p>What Prince, Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails and others are doing is great.  Truth is, they can afford to.  For the garage bands and future Grammy-winning artists who used to pour everything they had into &#8220;making it,&#8221; and were able to persevere and survive only by selling a handful of $5 CDs at their shows, their days are numbered.  And while it&#8217;s great to think that might level the playing field, or raise the bar on the quality and integrity of recorded music (as the only artists that&#8217;ll be left are the ones that aren&#8217;t &#8220;in it for the money&#8221;), at the end of the day, there will be far too many Dylans-in-the-making that never make it out of the garage.</p>

<p>What you are talking about is fixed costs. The cost associated with producing an album is essentially a fixed cost, meaning you pay the cost up front, and you don&#8217;t have to keep paying over and over again.</p>
<p>The marginal cost is the cost associated with developing each &#8220;copy&#8221; of a product. In the case of music, that cost is essentially $0, because it costs nothing to make a digital copy of a song.</p>
<p>I agree, however, that those fixed costs need to be recovered. The argument is that other revenue streams (live shows, merchandise, etc.) will cover this cost. I&#8217;m not so sure that other revenue streams will cover that cost, but I am not a music industry expert, so I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Even if you believe those models can work, it&#8217;s not up to the consumer end to unilaterally decide. Other models work as well, and have worked for a long time. Whether it will lead to success or failure, those choices are up to the people producing the work.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that are nearly free to reproduce. In fact almost any information is, and there are a ton of situations that that information needs to be restricted.</p>
<p>If you think these lawsuits are &#8216;ridiculous&#8217;, why would you abide by a non-disclosure agreement, for example? It&#8217;s just another form of DRM for information that will eventually get out anyway.

<p>Just visited the Radiohead website and I was tempted to pay for the song download. I didn&#8217;t, though, because I don&#8217;t listen to the band but the goodwill generated when bands give away music for free will surely generate some direct (and lots of indirect) revenue for them. Way to go, Radiohead. You have an admirer, if not a fan, in me.</p>
<p>If only economics would dictate how products are positioned, we&#8217;d have so much lesser litigation. Even though one can apply analogy to music and software, the two are inherently different. An artist&#8217;s ambition is to be famous (and rich, eventually) but someone who creates software has opposite priorities. That is why one should not look at art and business through the same lens. Artists saw value in turning music rights to record labels. Until now. Radiohead may be the first to break from their label, but they won&#8217;t be the last.</p>
<p>In retrospect, maybe I should&#8217;ve written this as a post on my blog. Maybe I will now.</p>

<p>Not to start a debate about music software here, but anyone who doesn&#8217;t see FLStudio as a powerful tool either</p>
<p>a: hasn&#8217;t seen it in the past couple of years (it used to be a joke)<br />
b: hasn&#8217;t used it or seen it at ALL, or<br />
c: heard anything produced by anyone who wasn&#8217;t an &#8216;amature&#8217; (sic).</p>
<p>FLStudio&#8217;s weakness is a very lacking library of included sounds and plugins; however, if you use professional plugins and samples, anything you make in FL can sound as good, if not better, than anything made in Reason, Cubase, ProTools (which according to a good friend of mine, is increasingly archaic in the face of newer software), Logic, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Really, FL  is simply an &#8216;interface&#8217; through which music is created. The reason I think you are having a problem with it is that, because it&#8217;s so easy to use, anybody can use it, therefore, lots of junk is created by people who don&#8217;t know how to write music. That&#8217;s like saying that because anyone can upload a video onto YouTube, YouTube has thousands and thousands of horrible, worthless videos and therefore, Youtube is also horrible and worthless.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve been writing music with FL for years now, and much of what myself and my friends have been able to create with it is close to the quality of commercial dance CDs, with the exception that my friends and I don&#8217;t have professional recording hardware, nor a mastering studio, etc. which commercial artists have access to; something that is totally independent of the software initially used to write the music.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610633" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I believe music is heading this way as well.</p>
<p>One of the things we have to keep in mind is that the artist still has to pay the songwriters for the use of their songs. The 2007 rate is $.091. So for a 10 song album, the artist or label is responsible to pay a total of $.91 to the songwriters.</p>
<p>Now if music is 100% free? Where does the money go to pay the songwriters?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t unless  new model is promoted or used the music industry. Sure you could propose pay up front model for the use of songs, but I don&#8217;t think many songwriters would go for this, since it is a huge source of income.</p>
<p>Why did Michael Jackson buy the rights the Beatles music? Because it&#8217;s a money maker. It&#8217;s kind of like the stock market. You can buy and sell rights to music, which continue to earn royalties year after year.</p>
<p>This is the drawback that songwriters and many in the music industry will certainly argue with. I don&#8217;t blame them, they would be losing a huge source of income.</p>
<p>Sure the artist could earn revenue by gigs and merchandise, but what about the songwriters? Without songs, there is no music industry.</p>
<p>Another consideration is the associated costs for an artist to perform. Most artist contracts dictate the artist makes the most of their money through live performances. This is great, but now the label itself is left out high and dry. They now wouldn&#8217;t want to put money into an artist. With no CD sales the label itself makes no money.</p>
<p>Now you are left with a bunch of artists with no money. If they have no songs and the label won&#8217;t put money behind them for promotion and production costs. You are left with just millions of garageband artists.</p>
<p>So you see, I do agree with the point of FREE music, but there are certainly many aspects of the music industry which most people don&#8217;t think about.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

&#8220;Stealing isn&#8217;t the correct term for copying digitial music becuase the original is left intact&#8221;.  Are you serious?  You are stealing from the artist becuase you haven&#8217;t paid for something that you are using.</p>
<p>So should all PPV TV be free?  The restriction is artificial.  Should books be free if I can just print out the contents?  Does this mean that you are only worth something as an inidividual if you produce something that can be digitally duplicated?</p>
<p>Your logic implies that if its easy to break the law to obtain something then that item becomes worthless.  What makes you think a music tax would help the situation, if the law is being broken already?</p>

<p>Since the cost and the value for making new music is still there but distribution for each additional piece costs nothing, why not pay for the act of creation and then allow for free distribution of copies under say a Creative Commons license.  The creator is rewarded, the middleman eliminated, and consumers get more freedom.</p>
<p>(shameless plug) That is exactly the concept behind <a href="http://www.strayform.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.strayform.com</a>.  Essentially moving payment from sales of copies to funding for creation.  I believe it is the solution for the problems of this industry.</p>

I can afford the $1.99 fee for the convenience of watching the shows on this little guy on my palm.&#8221;</p>
<p>My friend is a millionaire not for being dumb.  I guess that goes the same with the 99-cent price tag for songs &#8212; convenience.</p>
<p>Music industry people need to wake up and realize that Apple&#8217;s iTune (or Amazon or Walmart) is doing them a favor by offering a service.  99 cents for a song (or $1.99 for a TV episode) is a &#8220;service fee&#8221;, not the value of the digital file.</p>
<p>My nephew has a ton of songs on his iPod.  I asked him, &#8220;What are you listening to?&#8221;  Knowing that I am not a fan of the kind of rap music he listens to, he wise-cracked, &#8220;Garbage.&#8221;  I further asked, &#8220;How much did you pay for that &#8216;garbage&#8217;?&#8221;  He smiled and said, &#8220;The price for garbage &#8212; zero.&#8221;</p>

If I&#8217;m an artist and I want you to buy a CD to have access to my music, then you should. If you obtain, or more likely, distribute my music illegally, then you are liable for damages. The copyright laws of the U.S. are written with that view (read Article 1 Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution for Pete&#8217;s sake) and U.S. courts consistently uphold that view. Artists who create music are granted a &#8220;limited duration monopoly&#8221; (google that term if you don&#8217;t understand it) for ALL of their works. You don&#8217;t have to like the law, but you do have to follow it. If you don&#8217;t like it, work to change it.</p>
<p>Luther, I&#8217;ve made the point before that TechCrunch carries a cute little copyright in the footer of all of its pages. If Michael wants his own view of IP copyrights, maybe we should all take our own view of TechCrunch&#8217;s copyrights and just start &#8220;sharing&#8221; TechCrunch&#8217;s content with whomever. I wonder how the TC folks would respond to someone doing that.</p>
<p>I have been pushing for a mandatory IP use charge (read: tax) via ISPs since the late 90&#8242;s. Artists have to make money to continue to produce art and relegating their only source of revenue to touring isn&#8217;t anyone else&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>Michael, you have a lot of influence. I&#8217;d really like to see you channel your influence to help artists make money to continue their art. Check out Noank Media <a href="http://www.noankmedia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.noankmedia.com/</a> and let us know what you think about their model.</p>

While I really and truly abhor the major record companies, it simply does not make sense to suggest that indie bands with no following will ever be able to function in a &#8220;zero&#8221; pay environment.  And while it may be true that major bands will now derive the majority of the income from concert tours, so will the major record companies. Again, it simply does not make sense to suggest that they majors will fold up their tents and head for the hills. They will (or have) seen this as a new cash cow and will demand a larger and larger piece of the pie, to the extent that (as it largely already the case) the price of a concert will be disproportionate to what is being offered; just as has always been the case with cds. And four or five years from now we will be here discussing the fact that the fat-cat record companies have not only not learned a fucking thing, but have been raking in the money for years.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610671" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Mike, the trends you discuss are economic inevitabilities.</p>
<p>The real &#8220;pain point&#8221; is that nobody knows what music to listen to&#8230;</p>
<p>[i.e. you can get anything you want off of P2P, but you have to *know what you're looking for*]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s paralyzing&#8230;and time consuming to figure it out on one&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>The search costs presently born by music consumers are unsustainable.</p>
<p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, there is not even close to an infinite (or &#8220;un-knowable&#8221;) amount of music in the world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my belief that implicit recommendation systems like Last.fm are only useful in the absence of a legitimate form of criticism [whether or not that criticism is peer-produced and mass-customizable or more conventional].</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a technology entrepreneur but I also have an MFA in music performance, so I&#8217;m biased ;-)</p>
<p>I reckon that my point is this:</p>
<p>I listen to Last.fm, et al, all the time.  But, I never really hear anything that blows my mind, or that I&#8217;ve never heard before.</p>
<p>In contrast, when I listen to a great human DJ (e.g. brooklynradio.net), the depth of knowledge and emotional connection is undeniably much deeper.</p>
<p>Some food for thought.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610675" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Just like &#8220;information&#8221;, media like music has become a commodity. This does not mean, as Michael points out, that musicians and labels and distributors and retailers can&#8217;t make money from media &#8211; it just means they are selling the wrong thing. People buy experiences. (Who am I quoting here, his name is escaping me.)</p>
<p>So I guess I want to argue that selling convenience and portability is a valid business model for iTunes. Selling concerts for others. Selling ad avoidance is another. This is the business challenge. Easier to confront this challenge when one accepts, as Michael writes, the march towards free is inevitable.</p>
<p>IBM report from last month surveyed people on tv (not music sorry) viewing on the internet.</p>
<p>67% said they would watch tv over the internet.<br />
33% said they would put up with ads for free content.<br />
20% said they would prefer to avoid ads and would pay for this experience.</p>
<p>100% of iPod owners listen to music (probably true)<br />
What experiences can musicians, labels, and so on sell them? The real question is whether the incumbents get to have a piece of the action. It is really up to them and it seems they might not get to have their cake and eat it too.</p>

There is a value in avoiding the search, quality problems of P2P sharing. And in having properly ripped, labelled, tagged and named files. Speaking strictly for myself, that cost is around $2 per album (for 192Kb VBR MP3).

If it&#8217;s also close to zero, there will be no incentive for the artist to create the music in the first place. Hoping for an upsell to some kind &#8220;real product&#8221; like touring or merchandise isn&#8217;t always going to be a feasible business plan, no matter what Radiohead&#8217;s strategy may lead you to believe.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t economic theory , Michael, as much as wishful thinking. I like that you&#8217;re thinking of alternative ways to view the sale and distribution of music, but I don&#8217;t think the zero-marginal-cost view is practical. Letting the free market work itself out implies letter creators set a price for their goods. I think it&#8217;s a mistake to suggest artists should not have the right to set a price for their music or expected to be compensated for their music.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there will be a wide array of pricing schemes. Some artists may give away their music (or charge a donation). Some will charge. Some will bundle music with other goods. As long as there is a willing buyer, there will be a price.</p>
<p>As a listener, the though of no marginal cost is a bad one. I want music that is well produced. That requires some kind of budget. Zero-cost music implies little to no recording budget, which implies inferior songs, which implies little consumer interest. If consumers desire free music, I think they&#8217;ll end up getting what they pay for: Nothing.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ll all have great looking T-shirts, right?</p>

<p>Fussing with traffic<br />
Paying for parking<br />
Navigating through panhandlers, bums and other creeps to get to a &#8220;cool&#8221; indie venue.<br />
Paying for an overpriced show with sometimes hit or miss sound quality<br />
Paying exhorbatant prices for drinks.<br />
fighting crowds to get a good vantage point<br />
Dealing with rain, hail, blizzards, etc<br />
etc</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m whining. But you know what? I used to work at a record store and went to hundreds of comped shows at First Avenue, Target Center and tons of dives around Minneapolis. The bullshit gets old. And if I had the wide screen TV and type of sound system I have now, I would have bailed on the club scene alot earlier.</p>
<p>At the crib, I can watch anybody from Prince to Sade to Jimi Hendrix. With great sound and a perfect vantage point from my couch with a cheap beer my wife, friends and a pizza.</p>
<p>When you get a little older you might romanticize about how great live bands were/are, but then HD DVD&#8217;s of Pearl Jam come along and the hurt hurts a little less.</p>
<p>Video podcasts can be delivered like a frickin&#8217; newspaper to my virtual doorstep. I like that. And if they have a few ads that support the artist&#8230;&#8230;no problem.</p>

<p>I personally use my music downloading to find albums that are not available to me via the traditional store. I am talking about the less popular bands that no longer have an outlet. I have searched Ebay and many other avenues to find this music but had no luck. To me this is all a bunch of hogwash. I would love to have people download two or three of my bands songs and share them with their freinds. Until I havve world wide exposure.</p>
<p>People need to look at teh big picture rather then just themselves. I mean what exactly is Metallica doing these days? Ever since the Napster suit they are basically null and void. They got fat off from some kid sharing his music with others. Makes me so proud! (Can you hear the Sarcasm)</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610709" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Interesting to compare music CDs to Games.  There was a time when games were very expensive, and contained lots of DRM, including dongles and all sorts of things.  Not any longer&#8230;most games can be installed on multiple machines. But by and large, people buy their own copy&#8230;the game industry is at an all time high, and plenty of $$ being spent on games. Yes, there is pirating, but plenty of growth and money today.</p>
<p>Perhaps it isn&#8217;t the ease of copying, but the value delivered and what customers wish to do with it. Why can&#8217;t I listen to my music on whatever device I wish? Its not like i am listening to it on all the devices at the same time! Its not the copies, but the use that is important. If I want to use the content in two places simultaneously, I should be willing to pay for that capability. Likewise, I play a game on one machine at any time. I can&#8217;t play on two machines at same time.</p>
<p>The music industry should focus on the content and value, not the restrictions. Deliver content that provides value at the price charged, and customers will buy. Reduce the value or make it economically/physically expensive, and no one will buy.</p>
<p>Buying music that I can only play on my MP3 device is no of value to me, as I want music I can play whether I am in the living room, on my PC, in my car or in the gym.  Do that and yes, I will buy that (CDs today)!  If I have to buy 4 copies to enable that use case, then no, you have exceeded the value for price point. I will just spend my time and money elsewhere&#8230;.anyone know a good game?</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610711" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>So here&#8217;s what happens. Labels are like VCs, who invest in artists. Since they no longer can rely on CD sales for revenues, they negotiate 360 contracts that include tour revenues. The cost of producing a CD and its associated marketing is still high, so most up and coming bands will choose to take this money. (Much like tech companies choose to take VC money)</p>
<p>Now, the bands are making less touring, because a cut of revenues are going to the labels. Bands look for more revenue sources, and the most obvious one is corporate sponsorship (we&#8217;re already seeing this).</p>
<p>So, we have more bands take the Paul McCartney route, and get major corporate sponsorhips to make money. Labels will be more likely to go that route, since margins are collapsing.</p>
<p>Since much of revenues come from corporate sponsorships, the pressure to &#8216;be nice&#8217; will be much greater than it is today. Remember the Dixie Chicks? They spoke out, and took a lot of heat. Are we really convinced that corporate america will stand by them? (Note: I don&#8217;t say that to disparage the companies&#8230; they&#8217;d just be acting in their own interests)</p>
<p>We like to say the labels are evil, but there are lots of bands that took a very long time to become profitable (RadioHead is probably in that camp), yet the labels continued to support them. Just like a good VC, they understood that there was a unique product that would eventually pay off.</p>
<p>But in this new world, I don&#8217;t know that the patience will be there. The focus will be on performance, and selling big arenas. And who sells out big arenas? I&#8217;m guessing not the kinds of bands that most on this listen to&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re headed for the American Idolization of the music industry. I&#8217;m not sure this is a good thing&#8230;</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610714" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>(I started writing this post a few hours ago when there were half as many comments!  Then I got distracted&#8230;)</p>
<p>First, a note about FL Studio.  I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve heard anything that sounded professional that was produced with it &#8211; most likely because if I did, it wasn&#8217;t clearly marked.  At any rate, despite features, sound quality is a huge consideration for me when it comes to synthesis and sampling.  As an example, I use Logic 7 Pro (haven&#8217;t bought 8/Studio yet) and Reason 3.  While Reason 3 has some great features, Logic 7 Pro has a far superior sounding mix algorithm (or whatever you&#8217;d call it)&#8230;  there is no amount of effort I can put into Reason to make it sound as good, and bringing it up to TRULY &#8216;professional&#8217; is difficult.  (Fortunately, I can use ReWire to make the programs work together, thus getting Reason&#8217;s synthesis and effects and samples with Logic&#8217;s superior effects and mix bus)</p>
<p>Moving on to the business model:</p>
<p>One of my previous favorite local bands (which is not around anymore) used to frequently do shows at Blake&#8217;s in Berkeley.  You can fit MAYBE 150 people in that venue, but that band, by splitting admission and the bar tab, could make up to $2500 in one night.</p>
<p>Obviously, not every band can do that, but if a band could do five shows a month that were half that good (and live frugally) for months, it&#8217;s still going to be a while before they can quit their day jobs&#8230;.  but it&#8217;s viable option.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom in local music is that if you can reach that point &#8211; bringing out 100 people to shows in your region consistently &#8211; if you CAN NOT expand that into a larger audience (expanding your tours, playing slightly bigger venues, using your name and connections to get opening gigs for bigger bands), then you&#8217;re probably doing something wrong and will never make it.</p>
<p>Being in a band is a lot of work no matter what.  It&#8217;s one of the most expensive hobbies around, and like any hobby you have to be part of a select few to make it into a living.  Artists are prepared to sink a lot of money into it, as are labels, before seeing a return.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s something to think about:  A band as a performance entity is more profitable, in most cases, than a band as an entity that produces media available for consumption.  For instance:</p>
<p>All bands generally produce one full length album every year to two years.  They can sell one album to one fan for a set amount of money.</p>
<p>All bands have the option of going on tour whenever they want (personal obligations and restrictions notwithstanding).  A fan who buys a CD once and loves it may go to between one and ten shows with the artist in the same two year period it takes to produce a single album.  They may bring friends.  They may buy drinks.  They may buy T-shirts.</p>
<p>Thus, done correctly, the recorded music is an advertisement for a live show.  The CD itself is a souvenir (as Seth Godin would say) of the experience itself.</p>
<p>Now if you say, but I&#8217;m an artist who just wants to sit in my basement and make CD&#8217;s and get rich, well, unless you&#8217;re Aphex Twin you will probably fail because you cannot and will not establish the personal connection that people feel in relation to their preferred artists without the live component.</p>
<p>Saying you&#8217;d rather charge for the CD than make a living off the live shows is like Salon.com insisting that they can run their site entirely off of subscriptions and never run ads and provide absolutely no content to non-subscribers.  It&#8217;s just not going to work that way.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610726" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Lots of interesting discussion here. As a software startup guy, a musician, and a record label owner for almost 20 years, I&#8217;ve watched all of these developments with great interest, of course. I think the key to what Michael&#8217;s pointing out is that while people shouldn&#8217;t steal music, they also shouldn&#8217;t have to pay what&#8217;s being asked for by the labels. Ideally, the market will win out while people will also be honest. Don&#8217;t like paying $9.99 for an album download? Don&#8217;t buy it &#8212; go to amiestreet or some other place where you can pay what you think is fair for music. If you think a car is too expensive, you don&#8217;t steal it, do you? You go and buy another one. If everyone does that, then market pressure will inevitably lead to the price that people are willing to pay.</p>
<p>Realistically, though, stealing music is simply too easy, and hopefully is forcing a shortcut to the proper price. As a musician, I&#8217;ve released records on several labels medium-size to small, and never made much money at all from the record sales. I tour around the world, and don&#8217;t make much from that either. But I&#8217;m going to continue making music, releasing albums, and touring. I make some music available for free download; I make some available as paid downloads through iTunes and elsewhere (thanks to iodalliance); I make some available as physical albums. I figure people should listen to the free stuff, decide if they want to pay for something else, and that&#8217;s up to them. Hopefully they won&#8217;t steal the rest, but I don&#8217;t really care.</p>
<p>Those saying that small indie bands starting out won&#8217;t be able to make it if they don&#8217;t get paid for their music are flat-out wrong. Not a single band I know who&#8217;s &#8220;made it&#8221; did so because they made money from their albums. They made it by making friends, playing out, opening for their friends&#8217; bands, getting buzz, and attracting interest. Selling albums has absolutely zero to do with it at that level.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think if there is a problem for bands, it will come down to how to attract attention without the publicity machines of the labels behind them. We&#8217;ll still have huge bands, but it will be due to real crowd-generated buzz via file sharing, web sites, and word of mouth. And in the ideal world, that will result in better quality than the crap being pushed by major labels today.</p>

<p>Seriously, this kind of absurd oversimplification is great for generating traffic, but come on: perfect competition exists only in the realm of distribution (via replication), not in the realm of creation. Artists are not created equal. This is why the labels hate iTunes &#8211; they want variable pricing. A popular artist can name their price &#8211; the kids will buy it, just as they line up to drop insane coinage on 30-second ringtones (a business that continues to grow). Less popular artists will give stuff away to build an audience. But to claim that all music will inevitably cost nothing is utter codswallop.</p>

It will probably work for RH this round because it&#8217;s novel and interesting.  But I&#8217;m curious to know if the model maintains legs if many other bands were to do the same.  If it becomes the norm, I imagine fans will get frustrated having to put up with using PayPal here, credit cards there, and maintaining a bunch of different online accounts.  Which just points back to the iTunes/Amazon MP3 model.  As one commenter wrote, Amazon and iTunes provide a super-convenient &#8220;one-click&#8221; service &#8212; one for which I am happy to pay.</p>

<p>A fantastic analysis.  If you continue the logic it out what happens after the cost of music will drop to $0?</p>
<p>Artists then have no incentive to make new music.  Consumers will not be satisfied in a world where no new music is being produced.  So consumers will have to incentivize artists to create new works.</p>
<p>Artists having a variety of options such as touring or getting a day job, will have a minimum price needed to out weigh these opportunity costs.  Once created, since their is no distribution costs, price would again drop to $0.  If what these artists produce is of value then again demand for new works of theirs to be created would arise.  Consumers would again offer money for the artist to create something new and the process would begin again.</p>
<p>In the above example artists could further increase the money the make by increasing the value of what they offer consumers.  For example, they could include consumers in the creation process or have special offers to higher paying consumers such as their name in the song or a chance to view the rehearsal.</p>

The fact is that in todays world the music labels can set a price but ultimately we decide how much we are willing to pay. If they want to make any sells at all, they will be required to reduce their prices, eventually toward zero.</p>
<p>When prices get below $0.20 the services will just require you to carry a balance. This can drop the fees/track very low even on a $5 or $10 balance.</p>

<p>Besides, not every great musician or composer can or should be a show monkey. Some great studio artists make for very poor performers, investing their energies into quality ambiances, exquisite lyrics or exceptional delivery, more than focusing on how pretty they&#8217;ll look that day; I tend to like their music more. I don&#8217;t want a label choosing a good performer just because she can deliver a show that is a good enough substitute for a strip club visit.</p>
<p>Music for many is about a quality experience that can form, accompany or accentuate mundane or special moments; I want the best of that, the risk/return model for this is the division of expected returns over expected sold units, and I am perfectly content to spend less than half the price of a decent dinner on a really good CD or iTunes collection (that I can play again and again) to keep that ball rolling. Mike may like shows; I&#8217;ve been to too many; only a few were memorable and worth my money, let alone the ridiculous ticket prices they were charging before widespread piracy made those even worse.</p>
<p>There are always some inconsistencies in those arguments; first being that people who can&#8217;t afford $15 to buy a collection of songs they can play again and again will be able and willing to spend $150 on a show (more if they have a date); I doubt it. Second being that all music must be contemporary; no offense to these aging guys, but I really don&#8217;t want to see the Stones in concert. If they can release a few good collections of unique tracks, though, I&#8217;ll want that. Same for the Boston Philharmonic. They don&#8217;t visit Montreal all that often. Third being that magical thinking that proposes that people who share for free will lead to advertisement of that product, which will lead to more purchases of nothing, then ?, and then profits. Those who learned that one probably went to the Underwear Gnomes School of Commerce (or actually took long-term positions in the 1.0 bubble.) It doesn&#8217;t add up.</p>

<p>Your audience can be grouped into three categories:</p>
<p>1. The ones who like your music and buy your albums.<br />
2. The ones who like your music and download it for free and never pay.<br />
3. The ones who download your music for free, sample it and then never listen again since they do not like it.</p>
<p>Group 3 does not matter since they are not really your customers.</p>
<p>Group 1 is the group keeping you in business. If this group is large enough, great &#8211; forget about group 2 and be happy to be in the business.</p>
<p>If most of your audience is in group 2, making you are too poor to continue in the music business, there are two options:</p>
<p>1. Have them arrested for DMCA violations (your label may do this for you). This won&#8217;t make you richer but at least you&#8217;ll feel vindicated.<br />
2. Stop releasing music. This may make them miss you enough to buy your existing records and beg you to make more, but they will probably just move on and you&#8217;ll still be poor.</p>
<p>Most musician are hoping for an option 3: Force people to pay for your music, but reality is showing this is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>The only real solution is to keep going if you can and try to convert as many members of groups 2 and 3 in group 1.</p>

<p>&#8220;Artists then have no incentive to make new music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they&#8217;re not artists.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t make any money off my music.  I&#8217;d like to.  But right now, I make it for fun.  If I ever make money off of it, I will be extremely grateful.  Either way, I&#8217;m not going to stop anytime soon.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I produced/directed a short documentary about a local band, which was purchased by CurrentTV (you know, the Al Gore TV station) and has been featured prominently in some of their promotional materials.  It sums up the attitude of a lot of musicians who are in bands because it&#8217;s what they love to do:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.current.tv/studio/media/611" rel="nofollow">http://www.current.tv/studio/media/611</a></p>
<p>These are the kinds of bands who have the most to gain from the change in focus, because they don&#8217;t put out a lot of recordings but they&#8217;re fantastic live.</p>
<p>Mason got it right:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a single band I know who’s “made it” did so because they made money from their albums. They made it by making friends, playing out, opening for their friends’ bands, getting buzz, and attracting interest. Selling albums has absolutely zero to do with it at that level.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Some great studio artists make for very poor performers, investing their energies into quality ambiances, exquisite lyrics or exceptional delivery, more than focusing on how pretty they’ll look that day; I tend to like their music more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Louis-Eric, you&#8217;re assuming that these things are mutually exclusive.  So the best artists are ugly slobs and artists who are good performers are narcissistic hacks?  Well, if you think the Pixies are the best band in the world (and I think they&#8217;re pretty damn good) and your only examples of good performers are the Backstreet Boys&#8230;  well, that would be a valid point.</p>
<p>But none of that is true at all.  You just used a VERY elitist argument &#8211; &#8220;MY favorite artists don&#8217;t NEED to look good, because they sound good!  They&#8217;re TOO GOOD at making music to put on a good show!&#8221;  Hogwash.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re just not good enough.</p>
<p>The vast majority of artists who get signed to major labels will never earn a cent past their advance (if they ever got one) and will most likely either be cut loose from the label and just release music by themselves, or they&#8217;ll give up altogether and get a day job.</p>
<p>That paradigm is the same as it ever was.  Napster did not change that &#8211; I don&#8217;t know of any artists who somehow crossed that threshold downwards because of it &#8211; &#8220;Well I WAS a successful major label artist, then because of Napster the label couldn&#8217;t afford to pay me anymore.&#8221;</p>

What I said is essentially that one does not need to equate artist with entertainer; they may may be entirely different. If the only revenue stream is that coming from live entertainment, then we will have a smaller number of people producing good music, and thus less good music. If there is a way to make it possible for a good artist to earn a living doing what they do best, then more of them will do it and we&#8217;ll get better results. As for being elitist: yup, I do the best and I want the best; that&#8217;s the only way to progress. If that forces me to wear a descriptive label ending in -ist, then so be it.</p>
<p>On Radiohead: these guys are currently over-hyped for their move; no matter how well they do, the conclusions drawn here will not extend to the whole market; try getting the new Steffie Shock album out that way when a thousand others have done it before and press coverage of the &#8220;event&#8221; is about as enthusiastic and deep as that of a space shuttle launch. At this point, they have a nice gimmick going; not a new revolutionary business model vindicating the position of the IP thieves.</p>
<p>Fred: my thoughts exactly. It&#8217;s as if everything we have become good at here (shifting manual labour to developing economies, focusing instead on intellectual work) would have no value whatsoever. I&#8217;m not sure much good can come out of that !</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610771" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>A quick comment on studio recording costs and then I promise I&#8217;ll stay off this discussion for at least a few hours:</p>
<p>The idea that bands need to spend tens of thousands of dollars on recording automatically is mostly false.  Stories of bands spending millions of dollars on recording are generally the result of said bands going into the studio without any idea what they&#8217;re going to record and spending three or four months noodling around before the label forces them to pick their favorite tracks and get out.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this, but the price of getting a very good recording (not the best, mind you, but very good nonetheless) has come down a LOT.  Most of the costs associated with the biggest and best studios (preamps, the best microphones, access to vintage instruments and grand pianos, and giant spaces) have not changed, but most artists can&#8217;t afford that anyway.</p>
<p>The smartest artists invest, well, intelligently in recording:  Most elements of the recording do not require more than a few tracks at any given time and a small, quiet room.  Once you&#8217;re doing drums and string/horn sections you have to pay the big bucks, but if you&#8217;re taking more than a few days in a huge studio to record all your drums, you&#8217;re either figuring out the parts as you go (a bad idea), or your recording process is incredibly inefficient.</p>
<p>My point is that recording costs are important, but not as high as it seems like many people think.  It&#8217;s always an investment, and you&#8217;re going to have to pay it off over time &#8211; these things are true, and will always be true.  If the market changes in a way that affects how that investment is made back, artists are going to have to adapt.  It&#8217;s not impossible.</p>

<p>MUSIC AND DIRT SIFTING<br />
I always try to write articles on Unsprung that help artists and labels.  Usually I focus on marketing and leveraging the power of the Internet.  However, for this comment I want to talk about dirt sifting.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a large-scale dirt processing plant? Sifters, conveyors, shakers, trucks, hoppers and dust overwhelm the landscape.</p>
<p>Prior to modern dirt processing, man had to sort his dirt by hand.  Imagine sifting tons and tons of dirt, sticks and stones into separate piles organized by size and weight.  The process was hard and messy and it took forever.</p>
<p>Music is like dirt.  There’s tons of it, and the process of sifting through it was hard and it took forever.  Then came digital music technology – ah the modern dirt processing plant for music.   It neatly allowed us to sort out the sticks and stones, and pile them into little neat folders by mood, genre, tempo, artist, or into any pile we could imagine.</p>
<p>You know the mechanized dirt processing plant put the human dirt sorters out of business; but the dirt sorters didn’t quit, they learned how to drive tractors and trucks and how to run the sifters and sorters.</p>
<p>Then the dirt sorters grew the dirt market, and it grew and grew and grew, and now you can get every type of dirt, stone and wood chip imaginable; blue rocks mixed with white rocks, yellow wood chips, pink sand; if you can imagine it, you can probably buy it.</p>
<p>The dirt sorters were smart; they learned how to run the machines that made the neat little piles, and how to rapidly move the piles to the people that longed for different types of dirt, stone and chips.  And, they made a lot of money.  And they didn’t have to get dirty any more.</p>
<p>So, if you are an artist you should know that if you can find the exact pile to put your stones into, someone will eventually buy that pile.  And, if you are a record label, go down to the dirt farm, watch the dirt processor, ask questions, learn from the dirt farmer, and you will see – he is clean and he prospers.</p>

<p>1) People who understand business</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) People who understand technology</p>
<p>Michael, you may know a little thing about number two but you are very far off from number one.</p>
<p>There are many things I agree with you on Michael, but this isn&#8217;t one. If you were so content on this issue then you would remove the Copyright 2007 TechCrunch from the bottom of the page and I will aggregate yours and others content on a new website complete with advertising.</p>
<p>You live in a dillusional world where everything is free and incentives for production mean nothing. By your thinking, I shouldn&#8217;t get out of bed in the morning to go to college because there would be no incentive to do so &#8211; my skills will eventually be useless.</p>
<p>Your lack of understanding for value, incentives, mass markets and common law is mind blowing and you have only taken this argument from the consumers end of the stick. You haven&#8217;t even looked at it from a production point of view which is disappointing given your in the production (of information) business yourself.</p>
<p>The arrogance of some bloggers is getting very annoying.</p>

Unless effective legal (copyright), technical (DRM) or other artificial impediments to production can be created, simple economic theory dictates that the price of music, like its marginal cost, must also fall to zero.

<p>Which would unfortunately seriously undercut the motivation for many artists. Why spend actual money recording an album properly if you&#8217;re not gonna get paid for it?</p>
<p>Making good music is fucking hard. Making a living from it is even harder. If there is no money in it, you can see a good proportion of talented people going and getting office jobs instead.</p>
<p>Many artists don&#8217;t perform live. Suggesting this is a replacement for music sales is very naive.</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think this will happen. Many honest people have already demonstrated they&#8217;re willing to pay for downloads. Simple, cheap and unencumbered (no DRM) works.</p>
<p>Many indie labels and artists are proving this works.</p>
<p>Also just an opinion; I&#8217;m not particularly comfortable with the glee that some people exude when they talk about having &#8216;free&#8217; music. To me it shows a blithe unconcern for artists trying to make a living. No one likes the feeling they&#8217;re getting ripped off.</p>

<p>you who support piracy make so much noise and try to make it sound so noble. the truth is&#8230;you can&#8217;t steal anything else and get away with it using these same lame principles. just because you&#8217;ve gotten away with it so far doesn&#8217;t make it right&#8230;and it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re not doing far more damage than you realize.</p>
<p>i have no problem with the demise of the major labels. but i do have a problem with quality musicians no longer being able to afford to create good art because you prefer to acquire their music thru piracy.</p>

No amount of wishful thinking by anyone will turn unauthorized copying into stealing.  A song could only be stolen if somehow all of the rights to that song and all of the revenue owed the songwriter could somehow be transferred to someone.  Then they would have stolen the song.</p>
<p>Making a copy of something is just that &#8211; making a copy.  The thing has not been stolen, it has been copied.  Chuck (#97), you are not stealing the rights to the song.  If that song was used in a commercial, would the person who copied it get the fee for the use of that song?  No?  Then it was not stolen.</p>
<p>You say that the copier will &#8220;acquire their music&#8221;.  The copier does not.  He acquires a COPY of their music.  They still have their original.  nothing has been stolen, and nothing that you say&#8230; no argument you can make, can change that.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get on a high moral horse and decide that because you think it is stealing, that makes it so.  It does not.  If it did, that lady in the court case would be in jail today.  She is not.  She was sued in CIVIL court for a CIVIL matter.  Nothing criminal happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;you force musicians to earn their living some other way&#8221;</p>
<p> Musicians do not make much from record sales &#8211; the labels get the vast majority of those profits.  It&#8217;s something like 90% label &#8211; 10% artist.</p>
<p>So, the musicians are not being forced to earn their living some other way.. in fact, what&#8217;s happening is they are no longer being restricted by the label. If you think about the function of a label, it&#8217;s to a.) marketing and b.) distribution.</p>
<p>Both of those are done away with thanks to the internet.</p>
<p>So, instead of an artist selling 100,000 albums &#8211; they can now give away 100,000,000 albums for no cost. Release it as a bit torrent and it propagates itself.</p>
<p>Now they have a larger fan base thanks to greater reach.. and that means more fans paying to see them live and to buy their merchandise like shirts, stickers, posters.. etc.</p>
<p>The end result is a music middle class since labels usually only focus on few of their artists at one time, creating a small percentage of well paid artists while the majority are left out.</p>
<p>There is no way that artistic value will decline, in fact the opposite will happen &#8211; no more &#8216;cookie cutter&#8217; bands and a free market which will mean the more talented will thrive.</p>

<p>I have never said here that I support piracy.

If they like it enough to pirate it in full and keep it, chances are they&#8217;ll show it to their friends and it will spread very quickly.

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610839" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The flaw with this article is that there is absolutely zero mention of PRODUCTION costs of a CD. Forget reproduction costs (which are still tantamount) the initial recording of an album is insanely high, even when doing it yourself (as I currently am) the cost is around $2,000-$3000 for a Cheap PC, Cheap Software, Cheap Microphones, Cheap Cables, A Cheap Mixer, Cheap Monitors, etc.</p>
<p>This does not include the added cost of mastering the audio, which can be done by either purchasing an expensive piece of software (anywhere from $300-$1000) and learning the proper way to use it, or paying a studio engineer to do it for you ($1000+ range) which is what the labels do to get to sonic nirvana.</p>
<p>And there is also a ton of work and time that goes into recording an album. Time and work a do it yourselfer like me doesn&#8217;t get paid for and the labels pay through the nose for.</p>
<p>So bottom line is doing it yourself will cost you anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 dollars to get a complete, store ready CD in your hand. Assuming of course you didn&#8217;t pay anything for the creation of the albums artwork. That means worst case scenario an unsigned band will have to sell 300 copies of their CD at $10 a pop just to break even. Thats hard enough when the big label bands are selling their CDs (which are much higher sonic quality) at BestBuy for that same amount.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re talking about a system in which recorded music becomes sort of an advertisement for live shows. Part of me is with you on that because Music should be a service first and a product second. But, it is the sale of those CDs and Digital Downloads that funds an independent bands tour. If people can get The RedHot Chillipeppers CD for FREE why should they pay for my bands music?</p>
<p>Thus you&#8217;ll end up in a situation where big label bands who already have an established nationwide fanbase like the Chilli Peppers (who I love btw) are still making money via ticket sales, while bands like mine who are trying their hearts out to create a fanbase die off because we cannot afford to play shows or record music to give away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who cares!&#8221; I can hear you thinking. Until you realize that every big label band (with the exception of boybands) started out as local independent acts. Trust me when that pool of new talent dries up it wont be long before music itself dies.</p>

<p>band: my band rulz, it teh shizznit! here! its all free! love us!</p>
<p>us: cool! this is pretty cool man! good stuff this is deep *yaddayadda*</p>
<p>band: we want to play this club!? we rule! love us!</p>
<p>club: nope sorry you need *this* and *this* to play *this* club, if u dont have these things, you cant play here</p>
<p>(band plays club down the street, that always has live music while club up the street can no longer find bands with *this* and *this*, so now all the bands can play both clubs)</p>
<p>band: sweet! they love us! lets make a album!</p>
<p>studio: nope sorry no 10k, no recording</p>
<p>band: wow dude, you suck&#8230; dont you know bands dont make bizzilions of dollars anymore?<br />
(band now uses home recording software and or cheaper studio time some place else)</p>
<p>studio owner: um&#8230;. why dident we let them record for 500$ like that other studio? we dont have anybody using us to record! we could have just made 500$! lower the price!</p>
<p>band sells many copies at 2:00$ and make money cuz peaple like the show they just saw.</p>
<p>big label: oh &amp;%$^ im dead!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>also, how do u think music survived 2000 years before the labels got here?<br />
200?<br />
100?<br />
20 years?</p>
<p>if my (fictional) band and i can play a gig for a free meal, free drinks and a place to party.. im down, in fact WE CAN LIVE LIKE THAT DOING WHAT WE LOVE!</p>
<p>when we get tired of doing what we love, this career of partying and hanging out in bars with folks who know we are teh shizznit, we can teach music or something&#8230;cuz we da shizznit!</p>
<p>bottom line, the days of big bands getting bigger and richer cuz they can sell the same performace a bizzilion times are over, no amount of taxes laws or anything else will change this..</p>
<p>i could go on and on about how software and movies are not the same as music, and why, but thats a different **AA</p>

<p> That&#8217;s a very good point &#8211; production costs are very important to consider.. but also, they have ALWAYS been paid for by the artist.  Even the chili peppers had to pay for their studio time &#8211; the costs deducted from their share of CD sales, before they make a profit.</p>
<p>So, there&#8217;s no big change in that aspect.. it&#8217;s still paid for by the artist &#8211; but  production costs have gone down dramatically..  quality can be obtained from cheaper digital gear.. but even if you want studio time, pre-production on your home computer helps keep costs down &#8211; you already know what you&#8217;re doing when you hit the studio and can get it done quicker.</p>
<p>&#8220;If people can get The RedHot Chillipeppers CD for FREE why should they pay for my bands music?&#8221;</p>
<p>why? because they need new music man! ..and why can&#8217;t you be just as good as the chili willies?</p>

Yet, it has become a major industry&#8211;growing while music is shrinking. So this puts the lie to the idea that economic factors alone are driving the direction of the music industry.</p>
<p>In fact, economics are never are the sole driver of industry trends. Modern industrial societies have free markets but they also have rule of law and a cultural imperatives&#8211;both of which relate to ethics and to fairness. Insisting on ignoring these doesn&#8217;t mean your argument is strong, it just means you&#8217;ve oversimplified it.</p>
<p>We argue successfully against gravity all the time. My building has 5 elevators and 6 stairwells, and when I go visit my friends in California I get there by flying through air at 37,000 feet.</p>
<p>But ultimately the gravity analogy breaks down because economics is not the same kind of science as physics. Things keep going up all the time in human affairs&#8211;our collective standard of living, for one thing. Total wealth, for another. Life span. Connectivity.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610850" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I didn&#8217;t have time to read all of the comments, but here&#8217;s my take:</p>
<p>The economic argument is almost right, but your analysis ignores the fixed costs associated with music production. Studio equipment, producer salaries, etc. are costs that will prevent plenty of starving artists from competing with wealthy ones. Those fixed costs are high enough to constitute significant barriers to entry, so the market&#8217;s not really perfectly competitive at all.</p>
<p>Call me cynical, but I think you&#8217;re putting too much faith in the Web 2.0 philosophy here. The record companies are responsible for what we listen to (and steal), because they promote artists, as well as distribute their music. There are certainly costs associated with promotion, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll all agree. An example that comes to mind are music videos, which tend to come at huge cost to record companies. If artist promotion were to be democratized (a la Web 2.0) and studios were eliminated, I think you&#8217;d see smaller volumes of fans for any given band&#8211;big-name bands would disappear (think Rolling Stones, DMB, etc.). Ultimately, (and this sounds ridiculous, but it follows logically) bands would solicit investors, use their capital to hire PR firms, and studios/labels would be reborn.</p>
<p>Anyway, the costs are there because studios add value. As long as there are costs like those (marginal or not), music won&#8217;t be free (or nearly so).</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610854" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Josh, if you&#8217;re spending 3k on recording gear and doing an album, it&#8217;s not going to sound that good anyway.  I&#8217;ve recorded albums on 25k of gear and I&#8217;m still not happy with the sound.</p>
<p>And Joe is right about a lot, but there&#8217;s an important point to make about the studios:  They are being forced to lower their prices.  What sucks is that the &#8216;competition&#8217; (DIY) is never as good, but bands don&#8217;t know that until they&#8217;ve already invested in recording equipment and NOT recorded at a studio.  Thus, there has been a massive surge in the amount of recorded material being put out, but most of it sucks.</p>
<p>(Another byproduct of DIY is that bands don&#8217;t have anyone to serve as &#8216;producer,&#8217; which for many bands is the Quality Assurance person for the recording and song writing process.  Think about how RHCP sounded pre-Rick Rubin.  That&#8217;s how important a producer can be.)</p>
<p>And lastly, I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again:  If you&#8217;re a musician or band and you stop making music because you don&#8217;t think you can sell CD&#8217;s and make money, then you&#8217;re not much of an &#8216;artist.&#8217;  Most artists are compelled by something a lot more abstract than money to create their art, and those who make a living at it feel incredibly lucky.</p>

Of course the only way to stop the drive to zero is by technology or by law. Those are the only ways to stop any undesirable activity in our society. The question is where the balance should be between individual rights and these laws and technologies.</p>
<p>As manufacturing technologies improve, the marginal cost of reproducing *anything* approaches zero. This is why the issues of fake pharmaceuticals and copied music are in fact related to each other. Ultimately the basis for any economic value is the idea&#8211;the IP&#8211;rather than the physical good. One of the main purposes of having a society at all is the protection of IP, which allows specialization. Music is no different.</p>

Something that is in a form that can reproduced infinitely, and stolen at will by unscrupulous theives bring the value of that product down to zero. So, people who once saw an opportunity to be compensated for their creativity now will have no insentive, other than kicks, to make the music. Therefore, less innovation, less music. An analogy would be if we could all suddenly make perfect copies of dollar bills. The value of the dollar would be zero, and our economy would implode. The most IDIOTIC statement the author made is that &#8221; artists will stop thinking of digital music as a source of revenue and start thinking about it as a way to market their real products&#8221;. What are artists REAL products beside their art!? T-shirts and lunch-boxes? The whole premise, that it&#8217;s good to bring the value of soemthing down to zero (so we don&#8217;t have to pay for it?), is f***ed. No value equals no music. What an IDIOT.</p>

True, artists shouldn&#8217;t be motivated by money, but if they can get any kind of compesation, then it helps them keep going. It&#8217;s rediculous to expect the amount of time , money, effort that goes into making quality music to happen without compensation for the people who put the sweat into it. If all music should be free, them I guess evrything else should be too, as long as it&#8217;s there for the taking. Just because you can do soemthing, doesn&#8217;t mean you SHOULD do it. This is all basically just a big justification to STEAL something, to get soemthing for nothing, like the guy who jacks your car up for the radio, or a homeless person begging.

<p>First of all, most software is free.  Think about the software titles you use in a day.  Your browser, gmail, flickr, blogger&#8211;most of this is free.  Only the big applications&#8211;Word, Excel, Photoshop, Illustrator, most of them used for professional purposes&#8211;are sold commercially.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at music.  The marginal costs for digital music distribution are approaching zero because the effort required is minimal.  People who are not at all tech-savvy can download songs via P2P platforms for free and immediately integrate them into their collection.  They can transfer them to their iPods, send them via email, and then distribute their entire collections to others via P2P, CD, or portable hard drive.  In a collection of 1000 songs, what could the actual cost to pirate each song be?</p>
<p>Jumping back to software:  pirating applications like Photoshop isn&#8217;t nearly as easy.  The files are large and cumbersome to distribute, the copy protection is strong enough to foil the casual user, and most users have a hard time installing desktop applications anyway.  Jumping through these three hoops constitutes high marginal costs.</p>

<p>The arguments against your posts are emotional because the people who disagree with your ridiculous post live in a real world, not a theoretical one. You and Warren and your ilk can argue semantics and talk about your free music dream world all you want, but that isn&#8217;t going to change the reality of the situation: when someone else makes something, intangible though it may be, it does cost them something (even if it isn&#8217;t a monetary value). And when you take it without paying for it, you are either stealing it or they are giving it to you. And that is up to the person who made it. I personally don&#8217;t care if someone crams as much free music onto their ipod as their little hard drive will hold. but please, if you do, don&#8217;t try to tell me that you have any real claim to it. You are a thief.</p>
<p>Lets face it, the reason most of you are so anti-DRM has nothing to do with the fact that it infringes on any of your basic rights. It is because it impedes your ability to copy, pirate, and steal music to your heart&#8217;s content. you say it is &#8220;scary stuff&#8221; when people talk about legitimizing the download market, like it is some kind of Huxley-esqe manifestation of Big Brother, but really it is only scary to you because, God forbid, you might have to start actually purchasing albums again. I agree with #97 Chuck. This is sad.</p>
<p>Though the dissemination of free music is possible or novel or inevitable, that doesn&#8217;t make it justifiable. I know you are only arguing about the supposed economic effects as you see them, and I&#8217;m glad you have, in your mind and in your blog, solved this massive conundrum of the digital age for the rest of the world. Forgive me if I don&#8217;t buy it.</p>

<p>And guess what? &#8230; the value of the dollar IS falling and has been for a while. It&#8217;s doubtful it will reach zero but its looking pretty bad for america for the next decade or two.</p>

<p>The big thing you&#8217;re missing in this idea is that it is NOT free to make the music.  It&#8217;s only free to make the COPIES.</p>
<p>There are still many, many costs in the production of music.  Studio rental, paying musicians, mixing, engineering, mastering.  The microphone you play into with the guitar you strum all cost money.</p>
<p>And the time it takes to write and record the music is time not spent paying your mortgage or your electric bill, and I think that time is worth a monetary aspect as well.</p>
<p>I agree that music is getting cheaper to distribute, and I like that.  But it&#8217;s not free to make.  Not at all.</p>
<p>A great portion of my living comes from playing guitar on other people&#8217;s records.  I&#8217;m glad they pay me.  It&#8217;s how I feed my family.</p>
<p>So I hope you enjoy music and go see shows, but I hope that you respect that it is not free to make, and most of us who do it for a living are far from rich.  Thanks.</p>

Sure radio stations are paid to play music as a means of marketing, but the only play singles so about 2 or 3 songs are played per album.  If record companies suddenly decide that they want to get in on the concert side of things then digital music will no long be available and you will have to go to a concert to actually hear new music that isn&#8217;t on the pre-recorded version.  I understand that fighting the digital revolution like the RIAA and others are doing is a fruitless effort, but I don&#8217;t this the alternative is as good as everyone thinks it is going to be.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610896" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I enjoyed reading this. The problem I have with this post is with some of the assumptions that the author makes. Particularly, that if you can&#8217;t sell music anymore, make it up with live gigs/touring or merch. I have heard a lot of people use this as an example to show how musicians can balance people downloading their music for free and still make a buck.</p>
<p>This is a pipe dream at best. Yes, the cost of recording a cd has dropped dramatically. But what if the person who writes a brilliant album is the same person who can&#8217;t (for whatever reason) do live shows?</p>
<p>Take myself for example, I am a working songwriter who releases music on a daily basis. I am not in a position to go on tour and support an album to make a living. In fact, in order to support a family by touring, you have to be on the road for a long time. Or, be so popular that you command a hefty fee per performance.</p>
<p>This is not a reality for most us and saying and using touring as an example is not a realistic way to offset downloading.</p>
<p>Ironically, I make all of my money in music licensing so I don&#8217;t have to worry about people buying my music. I stream all of it for free on my website. However, I still believe that music in and of itself has intrinsic value in the same way that movies and well, any kind of intellectual property does. You can&#8217;t sit there and tell me that drug makers could give there medications away for free by making you watch a commercial first.</p>
<p>films and tv shows cost money. Hell, even when all of the networks give away their shows online with advertising, people still download them via bittorent.</p>
<p>Bottom line? They are going to start throwing people in jail. I guarantee it. I don&#8217;t agree with it but now that the riaa has won it&#8217;s first court case, the next steps are inevitable.</p>
<p>The only real way to solve this is with a general entertainment tax on internet connections.</p>

<p>Easy; Mike Oldfield. His &#8220;Tubular Bells&#8221; album made popular and accessible the idea of new age, ambient, and electronica all at once; talk about a seminal guy. Never toured; did one show, it was a disaster (for him anyway.)

<p>I think the major labels will eventually have to morph into promotional &amp; managerial entities that do more than simply distribute physical recordings. Already some record contracts are demanding a share of live performance and publishing royalties.</p>
<p>The only true value of a major record label these days is their financial and promotional muscle. Anyone can put out a record and book a tour, but it takes a major to put a band on radio and MTV and move millions of albums.</p>
<p>People will never stop buying physical copies of music. The limited edition releases are a great idea, an idea I&#8217;ve explored in my latest blog post, &#8220;<a href="http://inmyroom.org/a-return-to-a-singles-based-approach-to-releasing-music/" rel="nofollow">A Return to a Singles-based Approach to Releasing Music.</a>&#8220;</p>

<p>A: Less.  Nothing is preventing tshirt / concert / etc. revenue streams today.  Making songs free would simply cut off one current stream.  = Less money in the industry.  Inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Q: So, if music is free, will there be more new music or less?</p>
<p>A: Less, of course.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll remove (some) economic opportunity from some artists.  And you&#8217;ll end up with fewer songs / artists.  Inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Q: Do you&#8211;RIGHT NOW&#8211;have the opportunity to go get legal, free music, from independent artists around the world?</p>
<p>A: Of course you do.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Follow up Q:  Then why don&#8217;t you exclusively consume that free Indie music?</p>
<p>A: (Pause) Oh, most of it is crap.  Inevitably, some is cool, but there&#8217;s a lot of crap.   I support the idea though.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Musicians today already go on tour.  They already sell tshirts.  They already sell limited-edition boxed sets.  And yes, the RIAA are misguided jerks.</p>
<p>It should be the FANS who defend their right to pay.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t see why people are so eager to take dollars out of an industry they supposedly love.  Free music would be a huge rush for 2-3 years as we discovered all this great new stuff.  We&#8217;d congratulate ourselves on how post-commerce and free thinking we are.  We embrace change.  We get it.</p>
<p>And then&#8230;the catalog would start to dry up.  Fewer people would be in the industry, fewer artists would be cultivated, mentored, trained, mixed and recorded to greatness.  Is that what we want?</p>
<p>And I think we&#8217;d wake up a few years down the line with a terrible hangover, and ask ourselves why were we cheering so loudly for the demise of something we love so dearly.</p>
<p>Fight to put money INTO the system, dear fans, not take it out.  Fight for lower pricing, or choose-your-own pricing, invent better distribution to take 20points away from low-value dinosaur distributors.  Reward fans for sharing.  All these things can yield wider distribution, and larger personal libraries, and more money into the system.</p>
<p>Do everything but fight for FREE music. We can be smarter about this issue if we try a little bit.</p>

The fed controls the supply of money very carefully as to not induce rampant inflation, so your description about banks printing money is essentially bogus. Banks do lend money over and above their actual cash holdings but that is different from printing free money out of thin air because the loan has a collateral value including the interest paid on it. The dollar has lost a little of it&#8217;s value lately but that has nothing to do with some kind of recent trend of &#8220;printing money&#8221;. Our economy is still incredibly robust, in pretty good shape, so I&#8217;m not sure of the point of your doomsday scenario. Secondly, I can&#8217;t tell whether you are supporting or refuting music piracy as you are essentially agreeing that the hypothetical copying of dollar bills, like copying music, has disastrerous consequences.</p>

<p>YES! That is EXACTLY what I want actually. I don&#8217;t want artists to be trained, mixed and recorded by &#8220;producers&#8221; who homogenize art into stale forms.</p>

<p>Well, only when it comes to manufactured music from the &#8220;industry.&#8221; But, people will always produce art, and in general art is better if the artist does it because he or she is passionate about it, not because he or she thinks big money will be made.</p>
<p>One needs only to look outside the industry at the fringe to see the enormous wealth of artists that exist in every genre, who everyday produce new music that most people will never hear.</p>

Well, as my old daddy used to say&#8211;&#8221;Son, you get what you pay for.&#8221; Armand Morin has it right&#8211;there has to be a way to allow labels and writers to make money in the new society online. The problem as an insider of the business that I deal with every day is the fact that executives way up there in ivory Towers do not understand the internet business model YET. I say YET because it won&#8217;t be that way forever. Sure, for today they are winning awards in court against suburban housewives, but that is the tip of the proverbial iceberg. The industry must learn how to embrace those criminals, uhh, customers I mean. HOW? How about giving them what they really want&#8211;access to the artists on a more personal level. That is really important to most fans&#8211;the ability to contact the artist in any way&#8211;read healthy way here. The use of video blogs and dynamic changes in the way fan clubs operate is a good place to start. A form of profit sharing with writers will have to be put in place for this to work and it can work if labels will listen and learn&#8211;not from the web guy at an ad agency, but from real marketers offering real solutions to online business. I remember reading the ASCAP contract for digital solutions (I am a member by the way so don&#8217;t get mad). Nobody in the internet business can sign this contract&#8211;I mean do you think Google is going to allow you to audit their books just because you have a small download sales site online? NOPE&#8211;just not viable. So, long story short, everybody needs to get to the table and talk to people who have operated businesses online for years and know the rules&#8212;so listen up labels and writers&#8211;you need to be informed!</p>

<p>&#8211;This does leave on very important point where a record company could be useful- (and really is the point of me writing..) ADVERTISING &amp; DISTRIBUTION. -and not even so much distribution. (though at the moment you&#8217;ll need it to get sold at wal-mart- but in a couple of years that will change..) So- really advertising- You&#8217;re a great band with a great CD- but- no one will buy it unless they know you&#8217;re out there. &amp; that&#8217;s the point that the record companies need to get through their heads. It&#8217;s the thing they should have been doing/dealing with from the beginning. Song ownership doesn&#8217;t have a damn thing to do with a record company- never did. If record companies can get their heads around the idea that their job is to promote, advertise and in short- get people to buy &#8211; they may have a future. &amp; while in the process it&#8217;s great if the record companies can be a resource to artists (hooking them up with producers/equipment/whatever..) they&#8217;re there to get the bands name on billboards, in magazines, -and just get the word out for a fee. -and if they don&#8217;t get with the new business model- someone else will come along- rise to the occasion, &amp; fill this important gap. I don&#8217;t feel bad for record companies at all. They should be doing their jobs- not suing little old ladies &amp; kids. If they can&#8217;t get with the program- happy trails!</p>

<p>1)  Most people clearly have a misunderstanding as to the purpose of copyrights in the US.  Their original intent was to foster and encourage competition.  They were set at fairly short times (which, IMHO, have been wrongly extended).  A copyright was to protect a work for a short amount of time, allowing the content creator to profit from their creation, then it would expire&#8211;with the intent that NEW content would be created.  The intent of copyright was not to protect the work (and provide profit) indefinitely.  (This same principle applies to patents, too)</p>
<p>2)  Fairness is a red herring.  There is no right to fairness&#8230;no expectation of fairness.  Nothing is fair.  It&#8217;s not &#8220;fair&#8221; that I can&#8217;t sing well enough to start up a band and be successful (not that being able to sing is a requirement for a successful band).  The idea that the government ought to &#8220;make it fair&#8221; is based on emotionalism, not logic or reason.  The government has an obligation to enforce property rights&#8230;that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>3)  We&#8217;re just now, as a society, beginning to discuss what are the property rights associated with &#8220;intellectual&#8221; property (that is, non-physical property).  When copyright law was written, barriers to entry were somewhat higher, but not as ubiquitous as they are now.  As stated in the post, it costs virtually nothing for me to obtain the &#8220;intellectual&#8221; property of someone else   (a recording of a performance, the text of a book, the code to run a blog).  We have some people who argue that if its &#8220;out there&#8221; then it can be had for free (as in beer), like tuning a radio to a station.  Others argue that control of it, regardless of it being &#8220;out there&#8221; remains with the property holder.  But how does that work?  I own a CD with recording on it.  It&#8217;s my CD.  I can destroy it, give it away, sell it, whatever.  But what about the recording?  Do I own it?  I own a COPY of the recording, as does anybody else who owns the same CD.  I didn&#8217;t sign a EULA stating that I&#8217;ve only got a license to listen to the recording.  I bought a copy of the recording.  Current copyright law says I may not copy the recording (for profit or not is a different, but related argument) until the copyright expires.</p>
<p>4)  The real argument I think most people have is with the recording companies, not the artists.  Most people cannot understand why a CD costs more today than it did 20 years ago (in actual, not real dollars).  Then, they&#8217;re even more boggled why a downloaded song costs the same.  Most people have learned over the course of this debate that the artists get precious little for their efforts (with some exceptions).  People cheer on artists who cut their ties with the industry and strike it out on their own.  I suspect that these artists will continue to be successful, and even more so.</p>
<p>5)  Without condoning it, there will always be piracy.  There are a relatively small group of people who feel they have the right to copy whatever is available.  They are wrong in this&#8230;  but they will not be eliminated.</p>
<p>6)  If I was a recording artist, my business model would be to give away content on the internet and then make it up in sales&#8211;much like Radiohead.  I think they&#8217;ve probably got the best model.  If my music is worth listenting to, worth wanting, then I can make it.  If people don&#8217;t like it, it won&#8217;t matter what the business model is, I won&#8217;t be successful.</p>

After all, Starbucks charges you $4 for a cup of coffee it costs them $0.10 to make. Cable companies charge you $3 for local TV shows that they pay nothing for. Price is actually determined by what consumers are willing to pay &#8212; and that depends on how the product or experience is marketed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m published a full rebuttal on my blog at</p>

<p>and would be happy to debate the point with Michael (although I&#8217;m on the east cost, not west). The major point is that while the costs of distribution are going down, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily make the music free. And as long as artists want to be artists instead of professional marketers and distributors, they will probably continue hiring people to do that for them, and those people will put a price on the experience.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:<br />
&#8220;In the criminal law, theft (also known as stealing) is the illegal taking of another person&#8217;s property without that person&#8217;s freely-given consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, from the British THEFT ACT 1968:<br />
&#8220;A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of <b>permanently depriving the other of it</b>; and ‘theft’ and ‘steal’ shall be construed accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>Please do not confuse infringement with theft.</p>

I don&#8217;t see anyone with the same complaints about the film industry or the book industry!</p>
<p>Most people making movies are fully prepared to sink a lot of money into the bottomless pit of &#8216;film production,&#8217; knowing that the odds are stacked against them that they will turn a profit directly from the movie.  And yes, most movies (indie movies especially) suck, just like most (indie especially) music sucks.</p>
<p>However, most indie filmmakers are confident that if they stick with it, maybe their second film will get them the attention.  Or their third.  Or maybe they&#8217;ll just get a job working on an even bigger film with somebody who can make a profit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not denying musicians the right to charge for their music, but I am denying that they have a right to make a living through music.  Very few people can do that, and the poster above to mentioned getting paid as a session musician &#8211; that is an entirely different circumstance;  Playing as a session musician for film, tv, commercials, or major-label artists is a great living if you can get into it.</p>
<p>The band in the documentary I linked to earlier had it right:  They talk about turning the band into a business.  And they don&#8217;t mean that in some kind of horrible, cynical, sell-out sense &#8211; they mean that in terms of trying to figure out what they can do, as a band, that will allow them to continue to make music for a living, to make it their &#8220;day job.&#8221;  When it comes to that, all options are on the table &#8211; CD&#8217;s, shows, merchandise, everything.  They&#8217;ve even brought a silk screen to shows and charged to put their logo on the clothes people already had.</p>
<p>Louis-Eric:  You&#8217;ve got to realize that you&#8217;re talking about a unique type of genre and user-artist experience.  There are certain genres of music for which the fans don&#8217;t expect a live show, and that&#8217;s one of them.  However, the majority of music consumers expect to have a connection with their favorite artists that goes beyond just &#8220;I like their music&#8221; and into &#8220;I identify with their character, their tastes, their ideas, and their image.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe the solution is not going to be simple, it&#8217;s going to have to be tailored to each artist/band and their audience.  I think that free downloads coupled with &#8216;special edition&#8217; sets with extras and cool packaging could work very well.  Bands already have to get creative to stand out, and this new landscape is forcing that in a good way &#8211; see Beck&#8217;s &#8216;The Information&#8217; with its blank cover and set of stickers that allow you to customize the cover once you&#8217;ve bought the CD, PLUS the bonus DVD with (campy) music videos.</p>

<p>The important part is that Starbucks has convinced the public that the four dollar coffee is worth it, that they&#8217;re getting *not just* a thirty cent cup of coffee, but something more &#8211; it&#8217;s the experience of going into Starbucks, it&#8217;s how the &#8216;baristas&#8217; treat them, and it&#8217;s the (illusion of the?) quality of the coffee.</p>
<p>Anything else is just a cheap cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is up to bands to convince the public that they&#8217;re special, that they&#8217;re worth it.  The proliferation of singles-based albums means that most people do not trust that an 18 dollar CD that has one hit single is actually worth 18 dollars.  If the artist has built up a reputation (like Nine Inch Nails, like Radiohead) of putting out solid albums, they&#8217;ve earned the right to charge 18 bucks for an album if they want to.  Unfortunately, everyone else is starting at nearly zero.</p>
<p>But&#8230;  I think that I feel better, as a consumer, if I feel like artists are going to have to work to earn my trust that they are going to put out a good album.  If they&#8217;re willing to work for that trust, then I feel like it&#8217;s worth it to spend the money and I reward them for their efforts.  Since they&#8217;re not selling widgets, they can&#8217;t really tell me that what they&#8217;re making is worth X by default.</p>

<p>So true!  Many people get emotional about this issue, and while I&#8217;m no expert, if you look at the issue in it&#8217;s most basic form (that people can copy digital music at no cost to themselves) this comment rings true.</p>
<p>You can charge what you like for your music, no one is trying to take that away from the labels or musicians.  That is your right.  You do not have the right to profit from it.  You can try and profit, but this is not something that we can guarantee.</p>
<p>Going back to my earlier point about being able to copy music for free; I am not an advocate for copyright infringement.  I am just stating a simple fact: It does not cost me a cent to make a copy of a song/album.  It&#8217;s up to the musicians, songwriters and labels to figure out a business model that works when you take this fact into consideration.  Giving music away for free should be only a <b>part </b>of their model, not the <b>entire </b>model.</p>

<p>The major, traditional roles of the record labels seem to be going away: arranging/paying for the recoding of an album, and providing avenues of promotion and distribution. All of these can now be done without label participation, and for many artists the Internet provides as good or better prospects for promotion than a label likely would have. With radio becoming less relevant in the process, the old Music Industry Machine is looking more and more like an antique.</p>
<p>So for most musicians, the key will be to disengage from the machine. As others have pointed out, AllOfMP3.com provides proof that lots of people are willing to pay *something* for music, especially if they can get it easily. I admit to trying the service out for a brief time, and was impressed with the ease-of-use. The price point may need to be somewhere between the AllOfMP3 pricing and the &#8220;25 cents per song&#8221; that is often mentioned as the &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; for legal online music, in order for the artist and the service provider to feel as though it&#8217;s a win-win.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said, I&#8217;ve dabbled with downloading, both with AllofMP3 and just recently with Amazon&#8217;s MP3 service. I&#8217;m very willing to pay for music &#8211; the 1500+ CDs in my collection is evidence of that. In fact, if I could buy uncompressed music (and perhaps some value-added artwork and/or liner notes) via download, I&#8217;d be happy not to take up any additional space in my CD racks.</p>
<p>I want to see artists be able to make a living from their art. And I think it&#8217;s entirely possible for many to do so. It&#8217;s just going to take a completely different paradigm in the digital age.</p>

<p>The consequence of this struck me some time ago &#8211; that being that &#8216;musician&#8217; in the future might not be the ultra-lucrative occupation that it once was for a scant few in a brief period from 1950 &#8211; 2010.</p>
<p>Exactly how many human beings in the history of the world have generated above average incomes as as musicians, anyway? A few thousand?</p>
<p>Although I am not a musician, my sense is that millions of people sing, play instruments, or otherwise create music because they greatly enjoy doing it.  Most never make significant amounts of money at it, and most seem to view the possibility of becoming famous, or famously wealthy, a long shot.  In fact, out of necessity, I would suspect the vast majority of musicians (something like 99%?) are already in the situation of creatively funding their passion by whatever means they can.  In other words, the seller side of this debate seems to concentrate on the scant few.</p>
<p>Self-publishing technology has caused a boom in new authors, a boom in new books getting created.  Most statistics show that the vast majority of these are very cognizant of the liklihood that they will sell no more than a handful of copies.  So why do they do it?  They want to say something.  They want to leave something.  Or there is something about writing that compels them as human beings to do it.</p>
<p>The advent of better and cheaper production equipment is now making it much easier for a &#8216;typical&#8217; musician to express his passion.  It is easier than ever to produce professional product, and it will continue to get easier.  The highly desirable aspect of enjoying musical content in a digital form actually opens opportunities for this vast majority of musicians.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, low-cost high-quality music creation will converge with low-cost high-quality music awareness.  When that happens, the zero-cost reproduction and frictionless distribution we already have will tip the scales in favor of the massive amount of existing talent that is doing music largely because they love doing music.</p>
<p>But will they be able to profit from it?  Possibly, to the extent they want to and are able to.  Their passion may just happen to lie in an area that is challenging to profit from in the future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certainly not against anyone profiting from their talents, but there is no &#8216;right&#8217; to do that.  One can certainly try, even to the point of trying to pass legislation to protect it, but face an uphill battle when market dynamics make the climb overwhelmingly steep, and the masses are seeminly lined up against you.</p>
<p>That said, millions of people will still want to hear unique talent and outstanding production, so there will continue to be demand.  The scant few that can deliver a product that meets this need will find a way to get paid &#8211; the demand will dictate the supply.  But it is highly unlikely that these few will make a ton of money directly from the distribution of that content, due to its digital nature.</p>
<p>Maybe the musical stars of the future will earn average incomes in the future, and will live instead as musicians have throughout most of history &#8211; on the wonderful intangibles of prestige, sincere compliments, and free dinners.</p>

<p>The asian carmakers shamelessly copy the european carmakers. Who do you go see when you want to drive a fun car? The europeans.</p>

<p>Somebody will start a techcrunch copy? No problem, people will continue going to the original techcrunch because they want to know what Michael Arrington thinks.</p>
<p>The thing is that if you have a product that people like, they will pay to get the real thing. People can try copying it, stealing it, it doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>
<p>The same applies to music. Very few artists in the music industry are original. Most of them rehash old shit that was already been done before.</p>
<p>As for the artists who are just starting out and not popular yet. I know plenty of artists that are starting out and who cover their costs themselves and believe me, music piracy is the least of their worries. Nobody is really downloading their music cause they aren&#8217;t really interested in it.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world, it&#8217;s actually pretty easy for a budding artist to start out. I know people who have churned out very nice sounding albums for under $5000. I don&#8217;t really see the need for music labels anymore. The cost  recording and producing a high quality album is no longer prohibitive. Most bands I know were able to pay for the recording by playing a few shows.</p>

<p>Most artists that are relentlessly promoted by the culture industry cartel are marginally talented, but are &#8220;marketable.&#8221; Worse still, most new albums are engineered poorly &#8212; over compressed and homogenized to sound like every other recent album.</p>

<p>Some of these are debatable depending on your tastes, and some can be REALLY hit or miss, but I&#8217;ll try to be broad here:</p>
<p>Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails, Outkast, Jay-Z, the Neptunes/NERD, Bjork, the Flaming Lips, Muse, the Foo Fighters, System of a Down&#8230;.  there are a few with great first albums who couldn&#8217;t follow up, from the Mars Volta to 50 Cent, but I&#8217;d still name them as examples.  One of my guilty pleasures is Panic! At the Disco, who initially had barely any major label support, and it took an incredible build in popularity without that support for the label to decide to try harder to promote them.</p>
<p>Yes, these are VERY mainstream artists (most of them, at least), but I think they represent a strong intersection of exposure and quality.</p>

<p>Musicians may not be guaranteed the right to live off their music, but if the demand is so great that millions transfer the composition of a particular musician then that musician naturally should be compensated for his/her unique valuable contribution to the masses of music lovers willing to attain a copy of said composition.  It takes time/money to create and to be creative.  If one wants a copy of that creation and the owner is not willing to part with it for free then the artist/musician should be payed an agreed upon sum:  a sum greater than zero, and commensurate with the demand for the composition.  Therefore more popular artists are rich and the less popular ones keep day jobs.  It&#8217;s part of Capitalism.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610963" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thank you for the interesting article &#8211; You make a salient, and oh-so-true point, of which the industry would be served to take special note: &#8220;artists and labels will stop thinking of digital music as a source of revenue and start thinking about it as a way to market their real products. Users will be encouraged (even paid, as radio stations are today) to download, listen to and share music. Passionate users who download music from the Internet and share it with others will become the most important customers, not targets for ridiculous lawsuits.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is critical &#8211; in a very real respect, the recording industry behaves like the gatekeeper between locks in a river, where instead they should be perceived as what they are: middlemen who have gigantic markup fees to press music into portable media &#8211; and, thank goodness, we consumers need them less and less. Besides &#8211; tho I am much more inclined to buy a physical CD when the material included in its packaging are interesting, there&#8217;s not much of that out there. I&#8217;m also much more likely to pay for music when I believe my money is  going toward recouping studio costs than when I perceive it as going toward hiring lawyers for the RIAA.</p>
<p>I, too, am a capitalist. I am also a realist. Record producers do not provide the value in the music business- artists do. When artists have the ability -rather: &#8220;now that, increasing, artists have the ability&#8221; to cut out this expensive, litigious middle man and market the real value that they offer (be it concerts, whatever), the supply (the artist) and the demand (me, the capitalist consumer) will be much happier.</p>
<p>BTW Ernesto- the reason radio and the charts are filled with &#8220;crappy music&#8221; is because it&#8217;s profitable, not inherently because anyone who &#8220;values their craft&#8221; is out of the music business- whether your judgment of it is warranted or not.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-610964" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think the fact that many musicians and artists don&#8217;t or can&#8217;t play live, such as the composers of electronic, industrial, or other music that is largely created on a computer or some other medium that&#8217;s impossible to &#8220;play&#8221; in concert, has been largely overlooked here. It has been mentioned a few times, but I think it&#8217;s a very important argument against the &#8220;free&#8221; music concept, and especially against piracy.</p>
<p>  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s unreasonable to assume that artists ought to be compensated for the music they create by the people who consume it. It obviously has value above zero (even if the copying costs are near zero). For musicians and artists who don&#8217;t play live, this means consumers must purchase CDs or pay for legal downloads. If the only way for an artist to get paid is through shows (because piracy has made it untenable to be compensated any other way), then electronic, dance, and some industrial artists will rarely be compensated for the value of their work (why pay for it when you can get it for free, right?).</p>
<p>  Say what you want about the artist&#8217;s drive to create music because of some philosophical drive or a need to express him or herself, but when it comes down to brass tacks, if there is no financial incentive to produce these smaller, less &#8220;show-centered&#8221; genres of music, then the artists creating music in these genres will devote less time to honing their craft and more time to working their DAY JOB. This will mean that any type of music that can&#8217;t (or shouldn&#8217;t) be played live will suffer in the amount of quality product created, possibly disastrously so. At the end of the day, philosophy and the need to express oneself DOES NOT PAY THE BILLS. The end result will be a less diverse palette of music for the consumer.</p>
<p>One other small point. Experienced recording/mixing engineers, producers, and mastering engineers all help to create a quality finished musical product. If artists only make money on shows, they won&#8217;t have much incentive to put out a quality album. That means fewer and fewer of the aforementioned music tech types to create a quality album and/or song from the raw musical material (less demand, less supply), ending up in an overall quality degradation in recorded music. Piracy isn&#8217;t just bad for electronic, dance, and industrial musicians and artists&#8230;it&#8217;s bad for all music except live music.</p>

<p>  We artists, while we love creating music, also need to pay our bills. If we can&#8217;t make money off of it, we won&#8217;t stop making music&#8230;we just won&#8217;t make as much of it or devote as much time to creating a polished, quality product (this time will be spent doing things that will make us money so we can eat and have shelter and such). Music making will become relegated to simply a hobby rather than a trade. Because many of us will suffer through the drudgery of doing something we hate in order to devote what free time we can to creating new music, most of us will never assume our work has no value (and should, therefore, be copied and distributed for free en masse).</p>

So you think that musicians are blaming file sharing for having a shitty fan base? Talk about steering the argument off the road. The argument is more about the value of music, whether it should be paid for. There is no, repeat, no defensible argument for not paying for what you want to possess.</p>
<p>Musicians complaining about getting stolen from is not the same thing as complaining about having a small fan base. It&#8217;s not that musicians think that simply having a release entitles them to sales, but it sure seems that the general public has come to believe it entitles them to &#8220;free&#8221; music. What horseshit. Don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth paying for? Don&#8217;t buy it. Stealing it is not an option. If it&#8217;s good enough to want to possess, it&#8217;s good enough to buy.</p>
<p>Sure, some (a very small percentage) of bands make a living from tours and merch. But again, this is not the point. The point is that most can&#8217;t. The point is that music is NOT free to produce (the crux of MA&#8217;s ill-advised argument) and therefore should not be considered on an inevitable path to being &#8220;free&#8221;. The point is that if someone wants to charge for a product, that&#8217;s their right. And if the public isn&#8217;t willing to pay for the product, fine. But in doing so they don&#8217;t have the right to take it without paying for it. How anyone misses this simple fact is simply baffling.</p>
<p>So, you seem to need to take a little of your own advice and shut your own wind bag up.</p>

<p>You live in fantasy land. Yes, artists will create no matter what the monetary incentives, but you are kidding yourself if you think money doesn&#8217;t play a roll in an artists decision to keep up with an incredible difficult career. The reality of rent, groceries, family, health care catches up with even the most bohemian of artsists, and if they are able to get a little renumeration for their work, than they are way more likely to stay in the game for the long run. And who are YOU to take away the little compensation that they would get from recorderd music sales? They deserve EVERY penny. This is all one big justification for thievery. Even if CD&#8217;s cost 20 buck a pop, you are still getting soemthing that could move you, inspire you, enhance your life in a profound way, in perpetuity, and you are complaining about paying for that!? Music and art are infinitely valuable part our culture and you shouldn&#8217;y try to devalue it, simply because you are too cheap to shell out a few bucks for the priviledge to experience it. Music pirates are just whiney little theives who expect to have culture served to them on a silver platter, like everything else.</p>

Thanks for the 268-word response. I do follow my own advice and keep things brief.</p>
<p>You simply miss the basic idea here: Nobody with any sense in this comment stream, especially MA, is arguing for what is &#8220;right&#8221; and &#8220;wrong&#8221;, just WHAT IS! File sharing is hugely popular, deal with it or not at your own peril.</p>
<p>My point is that many bands, The Grateful Dead most notably, were able to successfully make a living while giving their music away for free (actually, the fans were just rabid &#8220;tape traders&#8221;, aka file sharers). They made it by live performances and heavy merchandising.</p>
<p>This is one way a musician can deal with an issue from which no law will ever protect them. File sharing is here to say. Period. ;)</p>

<p>Your argument is very sound.  I just have 2 questions:</p>
<p>1. If no (or relatively little) revenue is being generated from actual music sales, surely, that&#8217;ll cut the music industry down in size (at least in the short run until they are able to find a new business model like the video game industry).  (I don&#8217;t know what % of the industry&#8217;s profits are generated by CD or digital music sales but I&#8217;m assuming its a high percentage.)  So what changes?  For example do labels get cut out and it becomes artist to consumer game, or are there going to be fewer artists because the monetary incentives are lower or are the big artists simply going to make less money?</p>
<p>2. If copyright goes out the window for music, by the same logic, it is bound to happen with tv, movies, and books.  These mediums are a little different as technological barriers have prevented illegal sharing in the past but this is quickly changing.  Bit Torrent solves the problem of large video sizes and increasing bandwidth will make it even more convenient to share.  For books, once an &#8220;ipod&#8221; like technology or device (think digital paper, sony reader isn&#8217;t quite there) becomes available (and I would predict this to be soon) and books go digital, the same thing will happen.  What will be the result in those other mediums and can an advertising based model really support everything.</p>

He&#8217;s wrong about the artists because he&#8217;s unclear about the word &#8220;production&#8221; in music. On the one hand production means replication and that&#8217;s where he&#8217;s right. On the other hand it means the creation of a master tape or, today, a master file and that&#8217;s where he&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>A lot of work and money goes into the production of a master file &#8211; composers and lyricists work on it, performing musicians and engineers, too, and someone has to finance it. These people are the original owners of this piece of recorded music. It&#8217;s not just about fairness but it touches the most basic fundamentals of our economy and our ethics if these master owners are dispossessed.</p>
<p>In the past there have been many cases where the big labels have dispossessed the artists. Let&#8217;s not repeat the same wrongfulness by expecting recorded music to be free. Free music is theft unless it&#8217;s consciously been given away by the master owners.</p>

<p>Then again, I think; what if it were called &#8220;The Inevitable March of Viodeogames Towards Free&#8221;?  The same economic reasoning should apply, yet&#8230;  Halo 3, The Orange Box, Bioshock&#8230; I don´t see these things going for free in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Of course, they do have DRM. And of course people crack the DRM up.   Still, something seems missing here.</p>
<p>One reason might be the supply side.  There are so many artists wanting to find their own space that they´re willing to throw their work for free.  This of course creates a competitive landscape and drives costs down.  But maybe not to zero.</p>
<p>Something like Half-life, unlike a song, is so expensive to produce that DRM seems to be acceptable to the market.</p>
<p>My point being&#8230; the economic reasoning you´re using should also apply to Halo 3; my feeling is that it does not. And this begs the question:  what is missing here in such reasoning?  Only production costs and a huge competitive supply side?</p>

<p>1) &#8220;Theft&#8221; is not equal to &#8220;infringement&#8221;; notice how the RIAA just won their case in civil court? Theft would be prosecuted by the government.</p>
<p>2) Video games and software are not just files, they are sophisticated applications. It is much more difficult to subvert the DRM mechanisms. People are sharing these as well (go check out pirates bay), but the barrier to entry is much higher. Music is offered in an unprotected format on CDs and it is very simple to rip them.</p>
<p>3) For years, the big labels have provided musicians financing for production, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Technology has simply removed these barriers to entry, and the middlemen are scrambling to protect their interests.</p>
<p>4) The musicians&#8217; interests are not aligned with the interests of the &#8220;traditional&#8221; music labels. If musicians continue to stand with them and their practices, they will alienate their fan base. No fan wants to see their favorite musicians dispossessed, and most would probably argue for the musician to reap 50% or more of sales from recorded music</p>
<p>MA is saying recorder music is approaching zero, as in an asymptote that approaches, yet never reaches, zero. Would musicians rather have 10% of $0.99 or 50% of $0.50? The big music labels are fast approaching irrelevance.</p>
<p>Please keep emotion out of the conversation, humor and logic are better. How about a &#8220;y-combo&#8221; for musicians?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;realizes that they can no longer charge a meaningful amount of money for digital recorded music, a lot of good things can happen..&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;.. Lets apply business logic to this. Poof&#8230; the &#8220;middlemen&#8221; record labels go away and the value chain has a big fracture.. So what happens? Big artists can afford to replace the functions of the label with cheaper 3rd parties or their own capabilities, mid tier struggle to monetize their product, and garage acts start sending you harsh emails saying but dude someone needs to pay for our digital shxx man&#8230; .</p>
<p>So why do I say FINANCE.. just like normal business people these artists need &#8220;funding&#8221; to back their &#8220;business plans.&#8221; Cash for production, marketing, live shows etc..</p>
<p>So would this be good? Given the labels dont help or rape the small and mid guys anyhow, yes. But unless a new set of players or systems plug that hole in the value chain then NO for the industry in general. Micro finance, dare I say &#8220;asset backed&#8221; securities which allow artists to sell pieces of potential future revenue streams, music angels etc will all be needed. Anyone of you punters out there willing to buy 10 shares of Coldplay&#8217;s next album or tour? I would.. how about Joe Blow Snow from SF who only has played local.. maybe if I listened to it and as stated could self promote it.. Regardless, MONEY and FINANCE should be the discussion points about any viable future industry model. Not LEGAL and ECONOMICS.</p>

Zero production cost of copies doesn&#8217;t mean that there would be zero cost to create the original. It&#8217;s absolutely true that creating digital copies is free and easy, and that will, as you say, bring down the price of a copy. However, creating the original recording still induces costs. Ok, some people can produce serious results with their laptops in their bedrooms, but quite often music needs proper production to meet the quality standards we have today. And that costs money.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a simple ecomic law saying that if there&#8217;s a little or no chance to get your investment back, there&#8217;s no reason to make the investment in the first place. So, if the income from recorded music drops to near zero, there won&#8217;t be as much music as we have today, at least not in the form we&#8217;re used to have. I&#8217;m not saying that free copying will kill production of music completely, but there&#8217;s a strong chance that limitless free copying will reduce the amount of music being produced. Do you think that the consumers who are used to have loads of music available are ready to have less?</p>
<p>Yes, I know the industry will figure out new models to get income, and some will cover their careers by touring and other means, but not all artists can tap into this. Prince and Radiohead are already big enough to do whatever they like, but it doesn&#8217;t mean that other bands or artistis could pull the same stunts.</p>
<p>The point? Laws of economy also apply to creation of content, not just producing copies of it&#8230; The economics of recorded music aren&#8217;t as simple as you say.</p>

One, in which, you seem to want to suggest strengths (and weaknesses from the technology crowd. Is there a difference between a non-scarce commodity (recorded music) and experiences (ringtones, convenience of iTunes, concerts and boxed sets)? What do we know about competing on price?</p>
<p>Software is moving from cheap to free. Any commodity that is abundant is moving from cheap to free. This may not mean it achieves free, but it means that given the laws of supply and demand, if you make money $20 at a time for a commodity like recorded music and your unit costs are not going down at the same pace as the price you can sell it for, then you are in the wrong business. It is that simple. Anybody that is in this business situation, knows it, and should have a plan for dealing with it. Treating your customers like criminals and trying to &#8220;scale inconvenience&#8221; lack business and technical innovation and I think almost everybody commenting here could agree will fail.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-611010" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Perhaps the only thing I can hope to do as an individual artist is produce works of sufficient substance, merit or appeal that inspire patronage. Music is everywhere and is an essential component to many for a life worth living, but it is all too often taken for granted by many people &#8211; like fresh air or water. I believe that the government should be making educational and vocational training available to music business professionals who have been utterly displaced by these profound changes that have occured.</p>
<p>A lot of people express such contempt for labels without ever even knowing the full score or reality of life at a record label. Major labels employ more than fat cat lawyers and accountants. There are engineers, archivists, shipping clerks, warehouse pickers, etc. &#8211; all good, regular people who are also suffering from this radical transformation. There will always be people willing to pay for live music, but not all studio work or composition is intended for live performance. These people deserve compensation for their efforts too. Its endemic of a contemporary society that frequently values style over substance and is ruled by selfish greed and apathy towards the plight of others.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 39 years old, I support a wife and two children. I have been in the music business for over twenty years. I have been a major label artist and I have swept studio floors &#8211; most of the time I&#8217;ve been somewhere in between. I have often worked twice as hard for half as much as people in comparable positions in other industries because I know I have been fortunate to work in the area of my heart&#8217;s desire.</p>
<p>Now as I approach my fortieth birthday I am eeking out a living in the fragments and scraps of an industry where at this stage of the game I should have been enjoying some of the fruits of my labor. I earned the right to health care and financial security just as much as anyone else in another field. In its stead, survival has become the new success in my area of expertise.</p>
<p>I hope people at least think about people in my position the next time they visit lime wire.</p>
<p>Granted I&#8217;m not a young kid in Iraq dodging bulletts over a bullshit war, and I know its all a relative matter of perspective and that I have much more to be grateful for than bitter about.</p>
<p>Yet all the same I believe working artists and musicians deserve to make a living too..</p>

				<div id="dsq-comment-body-611013" class="dsq-comment-body">
					<div id="dsq-comment-message-611013" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>First to clear up some possible misconceptions; the majority of revenue for a record label comes from the sale of music. That means currently, labels do not get a cut of any merchandising, touring, endorsement deals, etc. While the labels are just now starting to get revenue sharing in these area, it is only happening with brand new artists who are not yet established enough to generate any meaningful revenue.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the price of digital music drops to nothing; the record labels will most likely go out of business in its current state. This could present to be a problem for both artists and consumers. In order to fully understand the issues and how they fit within the business lifecycle of a record, we have to look at the process as a funnel.<br />
Awareness -&gt; Exposure -&gt; Interest -&gt; Sale -&gt; Recommendation</p>
<p>In order for artists to make the kind of money that people hear about (millions) from touring, merchandise, endorsements, etc, they have to first be famous (awareness). Currently, the record label generates awareness through a combination of grassroots online marketing, media buys, major online portals (AOL &amp; Yahoo), national radio promo, national street teams, mobile partners, etc. Without this level of promotion in combination with good music, artists simply cannot reach the level of awareness and popularity that gives them the brand value to command large sums of money from endorsement deals or draw large crowds to concert venues.</p>
<p>An arguement can be made that the artist can promote themselves through the internet. However, they simply cannot do it to the scale of a major label. Look at the thousands of small bands/singers/rappers out there; most will never reach the level of success that Kanye, Fall Out Boys, and Justin are on. The few that do reach that level will do it with the help of a major label. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, there are currently 0 artists with record sales that have reached platinum status that did it without the help of a label. The few that have gained major awareness through the internet have signed with major labels (Cassie comes to mind first).</p>
<p>Therefore, if you take the labels out of the question, then the burden comes down to the artist to handle the promotion, publicity, marketing, distribution, and recording. The majority of artists simply do not have the capabilities to manage that type of work (physically and mentally). This means you either outsource the work, keep your operations small, or quit. If the artist outsources the work, then you&#8217;d have a bunch of small companies to deal with handling different aspects of the business. This creates more work for the artist and manager to figure out which company is best with handling what aspect of the business. At the same time, it would take time for these small company to develop the relationships that the major labels have with radio stations, online portals, etc. Even then, you wouldn&#8217;t have a concentrated promotional effort as all the company are separate (if they weren&#8217;t, they would be a record label). The second option is to keep the operation on a small scale and do everything yourself. This means that the artist most likely will not reach the level of exposure required for national success and will never make the kind of money that artists today are making. With 0 revenue coming in from cd sales, many artists will end up quiting anyway. The final option of course is to just quit from the get go. The second option is basically what&#8217;s happening now in the music business except the artist doesn&#8217;t pay the label, the label just takes a cut of music sales. If music sales go to 0, artists will now have to pay for these services with money generated from other income sources.</p>
<p>For the consumers, there will be a flood of small artists with few major artists (except the ones carried over from this generation). At the same time, because of the lack of concentrated promotion of a few artists, consumers will be flooded with so much choice that they may have to go through even more crap before they find something they like. And as the artist&#8217;s capability to generated awareness and exposure decrease with the lack of record labels, so do their fanbase, concert opportunities, and merchandise sales.</p>
<p>Anyways, that my take on the matter; I could be way off :).</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-611018" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;ve read about half of these comments and those that oppose tend to reiterate their emotional objections to this theory. He is simply making an economic theory about how he feels the music industry will progress. I feel that the music industry will fight it to the grave, but labels who don&#8217;t will be the ones who do the best. Money can probably be made by distributing the music freely on a heavily advertised website.</p>
<p>Those arguing that fixed costs are what&#8217;s important are simply wrong. Fixed costs are a form of a barrier of entry, but the marginal cost IS in fact zero. I can make a copy of a song on my computer for basically zero price (taking into account that it takes like a second to do). It doesn&#8217;t matter how much I spent in the recording studio, that has absolutely no effect on the MARGINAL cost.</p>
<p>Also, for those that make the analogy to the software or movie industry, he never said that those industries would fare any better. In fact, those industries will probably eventually mimic the music industry. The reason they don&#8217;t is piracy is not as large a problem in these industries yet. People pirate movies a lot, but if people really want to see a movie, then most will in fact drop the ten dollars to go see it in the theater instead of seeing a poorly recorded copy on their small computer screen. If people want a quality screening of a movie than they either need to wait until the movie is released on DVD (which contains bonus features that serve as incentives to buy rather than steal the movie) or see it in the theaters.</p>
<p>Software is not pirated as often for a couple of reasons. It&#8217;s not as easy to pirate and is not as convenient. The files tend to be much larger (and thus take a lot more time to download) and are in large part, much harder to find. BitTorrent is changing this, and you may in fact see the same thing happen to software (though software doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;live concerts&#8221; to generate revenue from).</p>
<p>Also, most new artists share their songs online for free as a way to distribute their music and develop a fanbase. I think that the biggest barrier to entry for a brand new artist is the ability to develop a fanbase quickly. The internet helps make that happen for artists and once they have a loyal fanbase, they can hopefully generate revenue with concerts or merchandise (or possibly advertising on their website).</p>
<p>My main point was that people need to stop attacking the author by analyzing whether it&#8217;s stealing or not (I buy most of my music &#8211; if I like it I&#8217;ll buy it otherwise I&#8217;ll just download it), and focus on whether the economic model holds (I think that this model will not come to fruition for awhile).</p>

They will always have a fair proportion of people paying for them to continue to create music. They probably never need to get paid much again, as they have already made alot fo money.</p>
<p>But what about the new artists, who would love the chance to get into the same position Radiohead, Oasis etc? Where would they be if they gave their music away for free or near-free? Nowhere.</p>
<p>It costs alot of money and time to write songs and record them. Alot. Singers/producers/engineers/musicians all need to get paid to feed themselves and their families. How can these people continue to earn money and feed themselves if they can&#8217;t make any money from what they have slaved over.</p>
<p>Just think about that next time you download a song and really like it, but don&#8217;t want to buy the album or give the artist any recompense.</p>
<p>At least sellaband.com pay the artist for all the free songs that people download (they are obliged to by law)&#8230; about 8 cents a track I think. I wonder if any of the other &#8216;free m3&#8242; sites are obliged to pay 8c to the artist for every track downloaded?</p>

<p>I believe Michael is simply making the point that, with the incredible expansion and increased saturation of information technologies, means of distribution, etc., it will eventually be impossible, truly IMPOSSIBLE, to charge for music distribution. It&#8217;s over. It won&#8217;t happen anymore. It&#8217;s not about morality, or even about business models. It&#8217;s about the fact that our world is changing into one that is so permeated with the free exchange of information (which is only going to get easier with time) that the old business model won&#8217;t work anymore.</p>
<p>That said, there IS a case being made (which I bet Michael would agree with) that there is, in fact, value to intellectual properties. I don&#8217;t think any reasonable person would dispute that. This whole issue of intellectual property rights and distribution has been bothering me for a long, long time, but after brainstorming about it, I think I&#8217;ve come up with an idea that might work. Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>The old model was this: music produced had value. That music was paid for by the profits made from distributing the music. But in reality, the payment was entirely intended for the actual PRODUCTION of the music (not in a production cost sense, but in the fact that artists are making the music.) So money was essentially given to artists (actually, mostly the labels, but I digress) for their artistic ability and the release of new material.</p>
<p>A couple of baseline facts that we can all agree on:<br />
1. Intellectual property does have value.<br />
2. Artists should be paid for what they produce.<br />
3. The digital age has made the distribution model, as it stands, obsolete.</p>
<p>Any new model that is created then, logically, has to contain a method for paying artists for the production of new material, but with the free exchange of information, CANNOT be based on distribution. So how can we do that without it being based on distribution?</p>
<p>(I mention labels here, but this method could be done without a middleman at all.)</p>
<p>Simple: pre-orders. Big artists simply won&#8217;t release their album until there has been enough demand for it through payments for pre-orders. One could even take it a step further and have us pay artists for even RECORDING the music. Once it is made, then it is distributed for free.</p>
<p>This would work for big artists, but what about up-and-coming ones? Well, that&#8217;s also simple. They gather exposure the old way: word of mouth, live tours, releasing music (for free) that gets popular. If they can&#8217;t spread by those traditional means, then they wouldn&#8217;t have made it in the old model either. Once they have built a fanbase willing to pay to hear them, they sign a record deal. Targets are set for how many they expect to sell for pre-orders, and once they are met, the album is released. People who pre-ordered can also get some sort of extra incentive for that act: a special edition album, early access, whatever.</p>
<p>This method would even work for small artists. They could just set low targets with small labels. That way, they could get increased exposure, get paid proportionate to their fanbase, and still have incentive to make music.</p>
<p>The only problem I see with this model is, of course, the obvious one of what if the band doesn&#8217;t reach their target? Well even in that regard, there are ways of making it work. If they reach, say, 70% of their target, they can release 70% of the album perhaps. Or, if they are let go because of disappointing sales, people simply get their money back (or credit for pre-ordering another album.) You could also work it to a certain amount of sales results in a song being released: say, every 30,000 sales equals one song.</p>
<p>I could go into all sorts of details about it, but I think you get the idea. It&#8217;s definitely alien, and obviously the costs would have to be lower (people won&#8217;t drop 18 dollars for music they&#8217;ll get in the future, but they may be willing to drop 5 into the artist&#8217;s hat to keep them playing.)</p>
<p>We have only ever been paying for the PRODUCTION of music in the first place. And now that distribution doesn&#8217;t work as a payment method, the only other option is to pay for the production itself. If anyone else has any ideas about a different model that would work, I&#8217;d love to hear it.</p>

Do read Koleman Strumpf’s (great name!) article in the NY piece, for those of you too jaded or otherwise herewith a choice sample:</p>
<p>‘Putting profitability aside for now, what is the explanation for the sales reduction that has occurred? The most obvious culprit is illicit file-sharing on networks such as Napster, KaZaA, eDonkey, and BitTorrent. While linking the two seems tantalizing — file sharing rose to prominence at roughly the same time that record sales started to fall — there is surprisingly little evidence to support the claim that file sharing has significantly hurt record sales.’</p>
<p>That man know’s his numerical mustard.</p>

I performed extensively until my late thirties, when I was finally a bandleader instead of a backup, and had my own small independent label. It all crashed because I&#8217;m really not a good businessman. I took a few years off.</p>
<p>Mid-forties, I&#8217;d moved to a new state and decided to try performing again. No one had any interest at all in hiring me for their bands. Considered doing the bandleader thing again but just did not have the energy to put myself through that again.</p>
<p>The advent of computer-based home studios opened a new world for me. I thought I could do my own work on my own time and sell my music.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m 52. What all of the above means for me personally is that now I can&#8217;t even count on selling my recorded music. Essentially there is no chance for me to have any sort of musical career at all. I guess the dream is dead and I&#8217;m stuck in this day job forever.</p>
<p>Oh well. Thanks, filesharers. Have fun.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all very well to say that artists should get nothing for their music, but in reality once the music costs nothing, who is going to want to pay 20-30 bucks for a tee or that and more for concert tickets?  People will whinge and artists will continue to get squeezed.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more if people can hardly account now for song plays how are they going to coordinate rev share from advertising that supposedly pays for these FREE songs.</p>

					<div id="dsq-comment-message-611042" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>In 2006:  I got the annual upgrade to keep Sonar current. Then I had to get a new computer to run it, because the software had outpaced my old one. Computers to be used as dedicated audio workstations need special customizations. So&#8230; $2,000+ already, just to be ABLE to work.</p>
<p>I signed on to an Artist Development program for unsigned artists, $2,000+. Services included web site setup (I pay registrations and server fees). Services included putting together a new CD (I pay printing and duplication fees). Keeping track? Expenses well over $4,000 so far.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t even consider what I&#8217;d spent over the years on instruments and equipment (decent microphones, digital interfaces, cabling, patch bays, outboard effects, etc etc). Nor does it consider the years I spent learning to play, learning to record, learning to produce, and honing all of those skills to the point where I could actually produce a finished recording that was worth listening to.</p>
<p>I made, oh, a couple hundred dollars on CD sales and digital downloads. About enough to pay for the software upgrade for one year.</p>
<p>Yes, the cost of reproducing a digital file is negligible. Producing that digital file in the first place requires many thousands of dollars worth of equipment, years of experience, and many hours of work specifically on that one file. All well and good to say &#8220;artists should produce simply for the joy of doing it&#8221;, but it is a HUGE investment simply to be ABLE to produce anything. If artists can&#8217;t get paid for the work, then producing music becomes a hobby, and only those who are independently wealthy and don&#8217;t need to have a day job will be able to afford to spend the time and the money to produce quality work.</p>
<p>Not paying for digital music is theft. It amazes me that so many people simply don&#8217;t get that.</p>

<p>Most arguments defy any common sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>By this token, all software should be free also, the most preposterous argument I have ever heard.</p>
<p>Creative people are paid as much for their vision as they are for their goods, and in the case of software you are as much paying for the benefit as the convenience.</p>
<p>Reproduction costs may be compressible, but the cost of creation and initial manufacture most certainly are not.</p>

<p>Thanks for stepping out and saying the simple current truth.</p>
<p>Lets not forget that music BEGAN as free on the internet. There is no arguing with the consumer, and the consumer (though perhaps can shoulder a convenience fee during this transition phase) was educated first and foremost that musical distribution is in fact costless.</p>
<p>Rather than complain or fight, labels (and artists who feel similarly) must actually learn, innovate, and adopt the reality and come up with some innovative ways to earn an income. There market has changed, and bitching will get people nowhere.</p>
<p>The real question for the industry is not &#8220;how do we get the listeners to pay for our content?&#8221; but instead &#8220;now that anyone can host and deliver musical content for marginal cost, what service can we provide to listeners that generates a decent revenue source for our artists?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a recording musician who earns no income and who has never had interest in participating in a crumbling and tightly controlled market. I&#8217;ve never sent a demo out to a label  (I provide my music online for free) because I sincerely believe there is no point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also a web developer, and the last 3 years I&#8217;ve been obsessed with this new opportunity (not a problem, folks, an opportunity) and will be launching a new service in 2008 which represents my constructive answer (maybe not the right one, maybe not the only one) to this exciting time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be sure to send the link over this way!</p>

<p>1. Content creators must be paid 100%. The idea that musicians should give their songs away for free as a marketing tool for Concerts and merchandise is dumbfounded. Singers, Musicians, Filmmakers sell experiences. If you experience it, they should be paid. (For instance there are gazillion times you hear a song and simply like it. You like it enough only to buy it. Its not necessary that you would catch the next plane to watch the singer perform).<br />
2. It’s amazing that the above question was never heard off in the age of the cassette tape. It’s equally amazing that the sheer inevitability of music and movies to be produced in digits invents this rather dumbfounded economic question.<br />
3. Besides, it’s impossible to apply this negligent theory to movies, software, games and eBooks which are currently facing the same future as music.</p>

Users who download can pay as much has they like &#8211; they don&#8217;t even have to pay. After talking to some radiohead fans, I realised a simple thing. Loyal Radiohead fans, will pay as much as they would for a CD, if not more. None of the money will go to record labels &#8211; it will go straight to the band. Additionally, people who would not otherwise spend $$ on a radiohead album will hear the music while not funding &#8216;pirates&#8217;. This will expand the listener base for Radiohead and enable their tours to be more successful and more profitable. All in all, I think this is a great direction the industry is going in. Techcrunch had a good article on the economics behind this: <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/04/the-inevitable-march-of-recorded-music-towards-free/" rel="nofollow">http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/04/the-inevitable-march-of-recorded-music-towards-free/</a> [...]</p>

When people googled this topic, some of them went to my website instead of techcrunch, and my ad revenue went up!  I made about $300 from this article alone!  Thanks, techcrunch.  But, you gotta understand: this constitutes free advertising.  So, techcrunch, I demand that you pay me a few hundred dollars to compensate me.  Email me to set up payment.  Thanks!
