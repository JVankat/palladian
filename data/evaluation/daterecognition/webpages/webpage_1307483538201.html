			<h4>January 23rd, 2011 by News World Report</h4>
			<div class="boxStats">
				<p>EVERYWHERE THERE IS WATER</p>
<p>1.    In all places we go there is water and the earth’s surface is composed of 332, 500, 000 cubic miles of water.But less than 1 percent of it is fresh and available, even when you include bottled water.</p>
<p>2.    Ice is a network of tetrahedrally bonded molecules which contains many vacant spaces.This is the reason why ice is floating.</p>
<p>3.    Well-experienced gardeners knows that watering the plants at day is not good.Droplets clinging to the leaves can act as little magnifying glasses, focusing sunlight and causing the plants to burn.</p>
<p>4.    You can extract energy from hydrogen and oxygen and scientists had less of an explosive technique from it.Strip away electrons from some hydrogen molecules, add oxygen molecules with too many electrons, and bingo!You get an electric current.This is true with fuel cell.</p>
<p>5.    Ferocious cycle.The earth’s atmosphere is warmer these days it is  because of the amount water in the stratosphere.That in turn may increase the severity of tropical cyclones, which throw more water into the stratosphere.It has been the theory so far.</p>
<p>6.    The slower rate of warming in the past decade might be due to a 10 percent drop in the stratospheric water.The cause of the phenomenon is unknown.</p>
<p>7.    There is no definite facts that will support doctor’s advice of drinking eight glasses of water everyday to their patient.</p>
<p>8.    Drinking of water that is more than enough the body needed can lead to “water intoxication” and further results to deadly cerebral and pulmonary edema.The cause of death for many marathon running aspirants.</p>
<p>9.    If the ocean’s crust is lacking of water, it will not sink back into the earth’s mantle.The earth would be more look like Venus and no plate tectonics will be found:horrible and lifeless.</p>
<p>10.    Recent evidence suggests that when the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago, comets had liquid cores.Life must have begin in a comet as what this situation means.</p>
<p>11.    Hair on your skin can hold water droplets too.Hairy legs get easily sunburned compared to a shaved one.</p>

			<h4>January 21st, 2011 by News World Report</h4>
			<div class="boxStats">
				<p>House reselling will entail for you to do some preparations first before doing an open house. No one would want to buy a house that looks old and dilapidated. Simple renovations and touch-ups will do wonders for your house reselling price. This article will teach you how to do that.</p>
<p> Number one, make sure that you de-clutter your house. Remove things that you are not using and sell them or pack them off. Think along the lines of a house that have much space and not necessarily empty. It is recommended that you eliminate the clutter in the rooms, garage and garden, too. You will surely appreciate the new look of your house when you do de-cluttering. That is advice we give to all our clients of our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.premierhomesofutah.com">Provo homes for sale</a> company.</p>
<p> Second, if you need to do some basic maintenance for the plumbing and electrical systems then do so. It is recommended that your plumbing and electrical system be in good shape when you start showing your house. Potential buyers will get turned off when you have faulty plumbing and electrical systems in the house. Many buyers will of course prefer properly functioning plumbing and electrical systems for houses. This is very important when trying to sell your home that is why we emphasize this to our clients of our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.premierhomesofutah.com/springville--f32921.html">Springville Realtor</a> company.</p>
<p> Number three, be sure that you apply a coat of paint for the interiors and exteriors. The rooms will surely look better and the façade of the house will look nicer. Painting your house is the fastest and most practical step in making your house better looking before you show it off. It is important though that you do house painting weeks before the open house so that you won’t have the house smelling like paint. It will look forced if you still have the lingering smell of paint. This is another valuable tip we give our clients for our <a target="_blank" href="http://www.premierhomesofutah.com/lehi--f32913.html">Lehi Utah homes for sale</a> agency.</p>
<p> You can also opt to upgrade some rooms. You can also consider repairing the damaged cabinets or shelves. It is best that you replace the old tiles with new ones if they are already chipped and cracked. These small things will matter for the potential buyers of your house. You will have a higher fetching price when you pay attention to house details. You will surely be thankful that you heeded these tips afterwards.</p>

			<h4>January 21st, 2011 by News World Report</h4>
			<div class="boxStats">
				<p>The outlook at the New Zealand Mine has gotten worse yet. The levels of methane gas within the Pike River Mine are too high at present to mount a rescue. The caught New Zealand miners aren&#8217;t even confirmed as alive, and a rescue could possibly be too dangerous to start. Source of article &#8211; <a target="_blank" title="Outlook for New Zealand miners gets more grim" href="http://personalmoneystore.com/moneyblog/2010/11/22/new-zealand-miners/">Situation for New Zealand miners takes a turn for the worse by Personal Money Store</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous gas in New Zealand Mine harmful</strong></p>
<p>The conditions inside the New Zealand mine will determine whether a rescue of the 29 caught miners will happen or not. The Telegraph accounts that dangerously large amounts of methane were shown in the air samples taken three days after the blast occurred on Friday, November 12. Mine explosions can occur because of methane which is commonly found in coal mining. There is a plan to send a bomb disposal robot into the Mine, which will further assess the scenario. The outdoors is needed for the battery operated robot to function though. It might not work very well if it is in a methane rich atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Chilean Mine miracle may not repeat</strong></p>
<p>After the Chilean Mine incident that had 33 men walking away, New Zealand officials have been talking to Chilean officials. The main difference in mines makes a difference to everything. The Pike River coal Mine outside Greymouth is not a copper and gold Mine just like the one in Chili; it&#8217;s a coal mine. The composition of coal ores makes it so dangerous gases like methane are released. This is what is hazardous about coal mines. New Zealand officials are keeping good mindset, however try to be realistic and &#8220;planning for all outcomes&#8221; including that lives may have been lost, according to <a href="http://premiumrealestatedirectory.com/Real_Estate_Companies/USA/" class="kblinker" target="_blank" title="More about USA &raquo;">USA</a> Today.</p>
<p><strong>Have not been able to communicate</strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand miners haven’t been heard of as communication hasn’t been established. Nobody has answered the phone line to the Mine even though it has rung regularly. New Zealand is known for being safe when it comes to mining. Throughout the whole world, there have been fewer accidents than there were anywhere else.</p>

			<h4>January 21st, 2011 by News World Report</h4>
			<div class="boxStats">
				<p>Protection of the Bush tax cut deal proposed by the Obama administration this week has centers on tax cuts for the rich. But there&#8217;s something for everyone in the mix. The greater you make the greater you save is how it works. Ironically, the package turns out to be a form of government stimulus derided by Republicans as they prepare to assume greater power in Congress. With any luck, if all goes as planned the Bush tax cuts can keep people from being forced to apply for a <a target="_blank" title="A payday loan with Personal Money Store is fax free!" href="http://personalmoneystore.com/payday-loans/">pay day loan</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Bush tax cuts package</strong></p>
<p>The Bush tax cut deal will cost the federal government nearly $900 billion dollars over the next 2 years. Individuals who live comfortable without the additional cash can be getting g a lot of the cash. The benefits will roll into 2011 and will benefit the middle class. Some of the benefits consist of a tuition tax credit, a federal joblessness extension, a payroll tax holiday and a child tax credit. Ending the Bush tax credits would mean that the middle class taxpayers would be bringing home less to their families each month. About $200 less a paycheck would be taken home. Americans in the lower-income would have seen a payroll tax. It would have gone up to 15 percent from the 10 percent it is now.</p>
<p><strong>A lot more tax cuts for the rich</strong></p>
<p>Everyone benefits from the Bush tax cut deal. It would help somehow anyway. The wealthy get the majority of the benefits though. The payroll tax holiday takes 2 percentage points off the current 6.2 percent taken out of salaries. Someone making $100,000 would get a tax cut ten times bigger than somebody making $10,000. Census data shows the average United States family earns about $52,000 a year. About $1,180 could be saved by the Bush tax cut extension for average homes in 2011. That is 2.3 percent of income being saved. Families earning from $200,000 to $500,000 would save about $7,500. About 6.2 percent of income could be saved by any person making $1 million or more which is about $129,000.</p>
<p><strong>The cash is invested too</strong></p>
<p>Broken down into Republican and Democratic wishes, the Bush tax cut package favors the latter. Tax cuts for the rich will cost $120 billion. That is just out of the $900 billion. Tax breaks suggested by the Obama administration take $450 billion from the total. The middle class would get about $360 billion for the Bush tax cut extensions. The idea is likes by economists. They think it is brilliant. There has also been a revision of estimates for economic growth and employment. This was shown on the news. Research groups in Washington are pretty looking forward to the Bush tax cut deal. They say a lot more jobs can be created with the bill than anything else.</p>
