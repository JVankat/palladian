<h3><a name="intro">Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands Intro</a></h3>
<p>In the introduction the Prince arrives in his brother&#8217;s Kingdom besieged by a powerful enemy.</p>

<p>As you gain control of the Prince for the first time, make sure you take a few minutes to get your bearings with the controller. Once you feel comfortable with the controls, move down the stairs and make your way to the fortress gate. As you run forward a massive explosion will occur destroying the walkway just ahead of you, there is no need to slow down, keep running and jump over the gap in the hallway. You will need to make another jump outside the fortress gate at the ledge.</p>
<p>There will be two enemy soldiers waiting for you behind the gate, press the attack button to draw your sward and swing at the enemies.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting for the enemies to retaliate, attack them! Hammer the attack button until both enemies are defeated. </p>
<p>Now, turn to the back right hand corner of the room, you will need to perform a wall run. To do this you need to run directly at the wall, keep the button pressed down until the Prince grabs the ledge. You will need to perform this jump again up a smaller wall to continue the journey along the fortress ramps.</p>
<p>There will be  another explosion in the walkway ahead, as you move along you will see that the gap in the floor is to wide to jump across . Don&#8217;t jump across, perform a horizontal wall run along the right hand side of the wall.</p>
<p>A group of five enemies will appear on the other side of the walkway. Attack them by following the buttons on the screen. When the enemies are on the floor lying on their backs, stand over them and perform a quick kill by pressing the attack button.</p>
<p>Once you have defeated the soldiers, carry along the walkway, watch your step , an incoming projectile takes out the pathway ahead. You will then need to perform another horizontal wall jump.</p>
<p>Eventually the walkway will end at a steep wall just ahead of you, you will need to perform a vertical wall jump , move along the ledge until you can&#8217;t move along any further. You will not need to worry about falling down to the ground, as the prince will automatically grab on the lower wall.</p>
<p>Ignore the incoming arrows, they will slam into the wall around you but none of them will actually hit you. When the ledge comes to an end, look up for another ledge to grab onto. Perform a vertical wall jump to reach the wall above and move across to the left.</p>
<p>This ledge won&#8217;t last long, there is another ledge on the wall to the left. You will need to perform a horizontal wall run to grab hold of it.</p>
<p>As the prince reaches a new walkway, a siege tower will let ten enemy soldiers lose! As you can tell this will be the biggest battle you will have faced so far into the game, so don&#8217;t rush into battle. Use this as an opportunity to learn how to dodge. It will come in handy further along into the game. It will help you to not get hit by the enemy when you enter into battles. </p>
<p>Once you have sort of mastered your dodge move, take it into battle for the first time, first start by kicking a few of the soldiers down, then begin slashing the rest of the enemies.<br />
Following the fight, you will need to perform a horizontal wall run to the right, along the damaged walkway. If you have encountered and injury during the battle have a look at your health meter located in the top left hand corner. You can smash vases and barrels block your gateway ahead, they will release red spheres that will replenish your health meter.</p>
<p>Once you have arrived in the next room dash towards the ledge opposite the gateway. You will need to perform a vertical wall run to grab the ledge above, move to the right and perform another vertical wall run. The ledge will be right behind you.</p>
<p>There will be another explosion. Causing damage to the walkway ahead. This will cause the Prince to lose his balance.  You will need to perform a horizontal wall run  to transverse the large hole. Make sure you start your wall jump at the very edge(to the right) otherwise you may fall into the hole before you reach the other side. Remember to smash the vases and barrels to get red orbs.</p>
<p>Once you have passed through the gate you will need to perform another horizontal wall run. There  will be more flying arrows soaring past. You don&#8217;t need to worry about getting hit.<br />
Once you have made it on the ledge move across to the left and perform another horizontal wall run to reach the next ledge.</p>
<p>At the left side of the ledge you will see a large red banner, move to the left and perform a horizontal wall run, when the prince reaches the banner he will automatically reveal his sward and use it to slide down the banner. </p>
<p>Once you have landed on the ground have a look around for another ledge to the left, use your horizontal wall runs to get along the next series of ledges until you reach another banner. Make sure you are directly above the banner, otherwise you will fall to your death!</p>
<p>The next task or manoeuvre is a tiny bit tricky. You need to reach the balcony on  the far side of the room, to get there you will need to perform a horizontal wall run on the wall to the right hand side, as the Prince slows down and turns to the left, press the jump button. Timing here is everything, if you press jump to early or late you will fall. As soon as the Prince turns his head towards the balcony that is your queue to jump.</p>
<p>In the middle of the room is a circular floor switch, step onto it and it will open the large metal door, as the door opens five enemies will appear.</p>
<p>In this battle follow the on screen instructions, start by jumping onto an enemies&#8217; shoulders, press the attack button once you on top of the enemy to perform an aerial slash. This is a fast and effective way to kill enemies.</p>
<p>Once the fight it over, remember to smash the vases to gain some health. You will need to step on the switch once again to activate the door. Continue forward. </p>
<p>There are a number of ledges above, you will need to perform a series of wall runs and jumps to move from one ledge to the other before making your way to the walkway on the far side of the hall. If you do fall, don&#8217;t worry you won&#8217;t die. You will just have to start over. </p>
<p>In the next section things will start to get a bit harder. Run along the wall to the left stepping on the switch along the way. As soon as the switch is activated jump across to the walkway. The switch you have stepped on will open a door at the end of the corridor. Once you have made it to the walkway, run to the doorway before it closes.<br />
If you fall whilst you are jumping you will have to start the sequence again starting from the first platform.</p>
<p>When you get to the next chamber you will find it comes to a dead end. Look up, you will see a series of ledges which will take you to an exit.<br />
Perform a vertical run to reach the first ledge to the left. Making your way to the balcony.</p>
<p>Once you have reached the balcony, he spots Malik and three of his men. You will need to follow Malik to get his attention.</p>
<h3><a name="fortress">Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands walkthrough part 2 &#8211; The Fortress</a></h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/52rAgO1xMhc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>From the balcony, cross the wooden beam to get to the next platform. Use your sward to slide down the red banner. Two enemies will approach you through the open gateway. Let them come towards you, when they are close enough, knock them down with a kick, whilst he is down, stand over him, press the attack button to knock him out with a punch (do this with the other soldier).</p>
<p>A large wooden gate is blocking your path. In the next room, climb up the two ledges on the wall and perform a horizontal wall run to reach the beam. Pull yourself up onto the beam and walk along , use your vertical wall run to reach the top of the wooden gate.</p>
<p>From the top of the wooden gate, move across the series of wooden beams. Once you have made it over the beams slide down another red banner to the floor.</p>
<p>After you have slide down the banner, be prepared to take on some enemies, this time you will need to hold down your attack button to perform a power attack. It may take a couple of seconds to charge up, so make sure you have enough distance between you and the enemies. It will take one hit to take down the enemies. The down side to this attack is you are not able to move whilst it is charging. If you are hit by the enemies you will also lose your power attack, you will therefore have to charge it up again. Once the fight it over, remember to smash any vases located around the area.</p>
<p>In the chamber, look for a series of exposed bricks sticking out of the wall, use a vertical run to grab hold of the lower bricks. Once you have grabbed onto the bricks climb up the trail of bricks. </p>
<p>Once the bricks have come to an end, have a look to the left and look for a circular switch. Make your way to the switch (on the left) you must step on the switch just like the previous times.</p>
<p>The switch will once again raise a wooden gate, as you reach the switch drop down to the platform and perform a wall run across the wooden gate to reach the platform at the end of the room.</p>
<p>As you enter the next area, Malik and his men can be seen retreating deeper into the fortress.<br />
You are too far away to get Malik&#8217;s attention. You will need to cross the nearby beam and wall run to get to the nearby tower to reach a ledge. Move along the ledge to the right and perform a vertical wall run to access a series of exposed bricks on an archway. Grab the next set of bricks , climb down the bricks on the far side of the archway.</p>
<p>Drop down from the bricks to the top of a wooden gate, jump towards the next set of exposed bricks on the far wall.<br />
Once you have made to onto the ground, roll through the small hole in the wall to reach the next chapter.</p>
<p>Five enemy soldiers will approach as soon as you have made it through the hole in the wall. Take some steps away from them and charge up your power attack. When the enemies are close enough release your attack button to wipe them out. Two of the five enemies may hold back in the adjoining chamber. Use the knock down tactic to finish them quickly !</p>
<p>Following the fight, climb up to the wooden platform, make your way to the  ledge and move across to the right then performing a horizontal wall run, jump towards the wooden beam. This beam will lead you to a series of bricks. Move from one set of bricks to the other use a horizontal wall run to the right. You will need to perform one last wall run to get to the balcony.</p>
<p>In the next chamber, the siege is still underway. Don&#8217;t let the chaos get to you.<br />
You must then proceed over a series of wooden posts and beams, you will need to perform a horizontal wall run to reach the far wooden beam. </p>
<p>The prince will finally get Malik&#8217;s attention, once you have activated the three switches on the wall by performing the wall jump, you will free Malik and his men through the gate. You will have to exit the tower by leaping over the ledge and descending using the bricks. After you have dropped down off the bricks, you will need to perform a wall run.</p>
<p>In the next corridor, make a wall run along the right hand side of the wall, leaping over the bricks on the left. Following the bricks on the right, you will need to perform another horizontal wall jump, as the prince slows down, jump and grab the platform on the right.</p>
<p>You will then come face to face with two sergeants. You must start this battle by kicking one of them and knocking him off balance. This will leave him vulnerable and you will be able to perform an aerial attack. The best tactic is to kick both sergeants twice, this makes them fall on their backs and easy to kill.</p>
<p>After you have killed both sergeants, move on and enter the next room. You will need to perform a vertical wall run to activate the switch. Run through the gate before it shuts.</p>
<p>A mixed group of sergeants  and soldiers will be waiting for you on the other side of the wall, move around till they&#8217;re in your view. Remember when you go into attack stand back and charge up your power attack, however in this sequence it will not have any effect on the sergeants, but it&#8217;s a good way to clear out those soldiers.<br />
When there are only two sergeants left, kick them both twice to finish them off. </p>
<p>The next chamber is locked by a metal gate.<br />
There is a switch you can press to open the gate. Once again use a vertical wall run to press the switch to open the gate.</p>
<p>Finding your way through the next hallway is simple, run along the right hand wall to a set of bricks. From the bricks wall run again to a platform at the end of the corridor. This will lead you to the palace.</p>
<p>Once you have entered the square palace chamber, you will see a marble column, jump and climb the column. Once you have made it into position press the jump button and leap from one column to the next. Eventually making your way to a balcony.</p>
<h3><a name="palace-courtyard">Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands walkthrough part 3 &#8211; The Palace Courtyard</a></h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XCTfwyUe0C0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>You will once again be left to look after yourself, go right and jump across the white columns. Do not slide down them, jump across to the next column.</p>
<p>Once you have reached the balcony the enemies have their eye on you. There are five soldiers and two sergeants in this battle. Remember you can&#8217;t use your power attack against the sergeants. </p>
<p>Once you have finished the battle you will need to move to the opposite side of the balcony. Here you will need to perform a horizontal wall run above the courtyard. Jumping and grabbing the first column.</p>
<p>Jump from one column to the next until you reach the corner of the room. Slide down the present column, until you are in-line with the top of the red banner.  Jump and slide down the banner.</p>
<p>There are some soldiers chasing after Malik, move towards them and take them out!</p>
<p>Remember to search around to vases and barrels. </p>
<p>Run up to the door where Malik and his men have escaped through. We can&#8217;t get through this door, so we must climb up using the bricks, jumping to grab hold of the column, then follow the on screen instructions.</p>
<p>Make a note of the pole sticking out of the wall. You can use this pole to reach the next walkway.<br />
There are two more poles sticking out of the wall above a large archway. Following the next walkway until you find another pole sticking out of the wall, once you have jumped from the pole slide down the red banner.</p>
<h3><a name="treasure-vaults">Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands walkthrough part 4 &#8211; The Treasure Vaults</a></h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A766VdB7E1s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Continue forward until you come to a short wooden post suspended above a pit filled with gold coins, perform a vertical wall run to reach the top. </p>
<p>Making your way along the corridor until you come to another gap. You will need to run along the left wall. And jump to the pole sticking out of the wall. Swing from pole to pole until you can finally jump into the walkway.</p>
<p>After you have made it to the walkway, there will be another pit of gold ahead,. You will need run along the left wall Continue doing this until you reach the top.</p>
<p>In the next chamber, there will be a group of enemy soldiers ahead taking some of the gold. You can take on these soldiers by using your power attack. If that doesn’t finish them off kick them to the fall and press your attack button.</p>
<p>After the fight is over you need to climb to the top of the copper coloured cage at the end of the room. Jump onto the nearby column, leaping to the next column on the left hand side, finally making your way to the pole that is sticking out of the wall. Use this to make your way to the balcony.</p>
<p>When you have reached the balcony you will have to jump and swing along a series of poles. Swing until you have reached the walkway at the top of the chamber.</p>
<p>Jump onto the gold pole at the end of the walkway. This pole is a switch, it will open the door at the end of the chamber. </p>
<p>You will finally be reunited with Malik.<br />
In the hall beyond the vault the earth is still shaking and massive boulders of rock are falling all over the place. You will have to navigate your way around the gaps in the floor by running along the walls. </p>
<p>You will then find yourself in a small chamber, the stone door is locked. You will need to step into the portal to find out what awaits you on the other side.</p>
<p>You will need to follow the walkway and make your way to the fountain, you will go into a cutscene and eventually will be back in the corridor you once started in. </p>
<p>The door that was once locked is now open. As you step into the hallway a cut scene will occur. Follow the on screen instructions on how to wind back time. You can use this “wind back time” if you are falling, press the R1 button to wind back time.</p>
<p>When the floor starts to collapse you will need to perform a wall run. Remember your new power, if you don&#8217;t want to die (an embarrassing death) use your wind-back-time power to wind back time.</p>
<h3><a name="stables">Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands walkthrough part 5 &#8211; The Stables</a></h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NwAxVfeSnBc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As you make your way into the stables, you are stalked by some wraiths hiding in the shadows, move into the stall on the left to make the wraiths show themselves, they will pop out of the floor. They do look scary but you will need to be prepared for a fight. You can use your power attack on the wraiths as they perform the same as soldiers. Remember to step back and charge up your power attack. Once you have performed your power attack roll for cover.</p>
<p>You will then need to enter the stable area on the left, climb up onto the wooden stall then across to the wooden beam to reach some poles. </p>
<p>Jump from column to column. Until you reach the ledge on the far wall. Perform a horizontal wall jump to reach the next set of columns making your way to the balcony.</p>
<p>On the balcony you will be able to reach the gold switch, the door on the opposite side of the room will open. Swing and jump your way to the doorway. Don&#8217;t worry about the bats, as you jump onto the poles they will fly away.</p>
<p>In the next corridor you will need to roll through a small hole before the shield collapses under the force and weight of the door.</p>
<p>Now that the palace&#8217;s defences have been activated, you will need to swing back and forth through the hallway. The easiest way to get past the trap is to follow the log, as it swings towards you roll  underneath it. There will be the same trap in the next hallway.</p>
<p>There will be more wraiths waiting ahead for us in the next room, so charge up the power attack manoeuvre and wait for them to move into range.</p>
<p>You will need to perform a wall run, whilst you are doing this you will activate a switch that will release a series of poles and pole switches on the other side of the room. Swing across four poles to make your way to the other side of the room. You will need to wall jump until you can find a wall of bricks to grab hold of. Once you have grabbed hold of the bricks, jump over and grab the wooden post sticking out behind you. </p>
<p>Once you have reached the next room you will need to cross some wooden beams making your way to the red banners on the opposite side of the room.<br />
As you enter the next corridor three more wraiths will appear, once you have dealt with them you will have to get through this section quickly as there are giant bladed pendulums swinging back and forth. You will always need to focus on the pendulum in front of you. Once they swing to the left you will need to be quick and roll to get out of the way.</p>
<p>When you get to the next room, you will find a large wooden leaver in the middle of the floor. Follow the on screen instructions.</p>
<p>Wall run up the scaffolding, continue jumping until you reach a wooden beam, then you can jump over to the gold switch hanging from the ceiling. </p>
<p>Go back to the leaver and pull it until it is facing the stone door. This will give you another wooden panel that will allow you to reach another pole.</p>
<p>After the fight move between the new platforms, in the next chamber there will be some enemies that have been turned into sand. There will also be a brief cutscene revealing the whereabouts of the Sarcophagus location, each Sarcophagus location is a hidden item.</p>
<p>The passage ahead is filled with more pendulums, there is really no need to rush in this section, so take your time. </p>
<p>In the next room you will finally catch up with Malik, after your conversation with Malik, slide down the banner making your way to the next pole switch.<br />
Once you have pulled the first pole switch and made your way to the walkway, there will be another switch, run up the wall near the door and the switch will be there. This will raise a second column near the circular platform.</p>
<p>Jump from column to column rolling through the doorway to ensure you make it through alive! Continue to the next hallway where you can access the next area.</p>
<h3><a name="works">Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands walkthrough part 6 &#8211; The Works</a></h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6LWq9SyNuzs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In the next section you will need to move past all the hazards. What out for the large metal wall section that will emerge. As the metal wall retracts and the stone wall reappears quickly perform a horizontal wall jump to make it across to the other side. </p>
<p>Once you have made it to the other side, take a couple of seconds to remember the pattern of the rotating cog to your right. </p>
<p>You will then come across two moving wall pieces, as they drop into position make a wall run, once you have made it passed all the hazards you will come to some columns.</p>
<p>Jump across to the next column, watching the movement of the metal wall pieces behind you. The wall closest to you has a ledge, jump and grab onto the ledge. If you are fast enough you can wall run to the left and grab the pole. </p>
<p>You will then have to jump across a series of four poles to slide down the red banner, however you need to time your jumps, when your reach the second pole hang tight for a few seconds and let the giant cog swing past. Once you have made it to the fourth pole, slide down the banner and pass through a small hall to get to the next room.</p>
<p>Start in this room by jumping over the central wooden platform you will find a level on this platform that is able to rotate. Rotate the platform a quarter of the way round counter-clockwise to post the posts in position. Once they have all been put into position make your way across. </p>
<p>You must now perform a couple hazard wall jumps. You will have to perform these jumps whilst looking out for traps. The first trap is a buzz saw located in the wall. The second  trap is a pole covered in sharp blades. </p>
<p>You will then have to run up the tower wall to reach the ledge, when a smooth metal surface is exposed use it to grab onto the ledge. From the second ledge jump to the ledge behind you moving to the right and then performing another horizontal wall run. Watch out for the buzz saw trap! It is set into the wall.</p>
<p>Before you jump make sure you align the wooden posts attached to the central platform, move to the left and to the right until your body is in line with the post. </p>
<p>On the balcony wall run up to the wooden door and jump over to the golden switch(pole) when the platform has raised make your way back over to the platform.</p>
<p>Now you will have to interact with it, move the platform until the wooden post is pointing at the large tower marked by the circular switch.<br />
Once the switch has been activated it will open a stone door at the opposite side of the room. </p>
<p>Use the leaver once again to rotate the platform 180 degrees, and dash to the door before it shuts. </p>
<p>There is another leaver and machinery that will be waiting for you in the next room.</p>
<p>Leap to the golden pole switch to raise the platform near the rooms entrance. Jump and perform a vertical wall run to access another leaver. </p>
<p>You will need to rotate this leaver (a quarter of turn) once it is put into place make your way back to the entrance of the room.</p>
<p>Once you have made it back to the first level, push it a quarter of a turn to lower the column. Jump over to the platform and perform a vertical wall run.</p>
<p>Now you will need to jump to the pole on the left side of the room. From here you can make your way to the balcony that is infested with wraiths.</p>
<p>Once you land on the balcony it might be a good idea to start slaying! Once you have got the upgrade a good choice would the stone armour (if you don&#8217;t have it already).</p>
<p>There will be more traps waiting for you in the next corridor!</p>
<h3><a name="fortress-courtyard">Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands walkthrough part 7 &#8211; The Fortress Courtyard</a></h3>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BhjehH3itHA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>You will need to run towards the door that is blocked by guards (they have been turned to sand). You will need to perform a vertical wall jump to reach the nearest pole.</p>
<p>You must swing from pole to pole. Once you have reached the ledge you will need to move to the right hand side. You must time this wall run as there are sliding blades on the stone wall.</p>
<p>Once you have completed that task you will need to jump over to the next two poles before jumping onto the bricks.</p>
<p>You will need to perform a wall run between the two intersecting blades. As soon as they cross one another jump to your left and grab the pole. Swing yourself to the next pole and jump onto the ledge.</p>
<p>You will then come to another section with some blades, as soon as there is a gap between the blades jump!  Use the column to get to the ledge on the other side.</p>
<p>Once you have killed the sand monsters, take some time to upgrade yourself. </p>
<p>You will come to some more blades, roll underneath them. You will also need to perform a wall run, do this carefully. You will need to time the run.</p>
<p>Move yourself down the red banner, move yourself down and across the gap, use your power attack to break the Sarcophagus.</p>
<p>You will then need to perform a wall run past some more blades. Time your jumps carefully, then swing from pole to pole until you reach the other side.</p>
<p>Make your way to the closing door, which is located on the left turn. You will have to perform a wall run over the gap and make your way up the stairs. Once you have reached the top of the stairs, a strange monster will appear. He will bash his horns into the side of the building. You will need to jump off  the stairs. Remember if you fall you can always use your wind back time button R1.</p>
<p>You will need to perform another wall jump passed the new gaps. You will need to move fast as there are newly forming gaps. Try and make it over the gaps before they have even formed. </p>
<p>Move through the open door way, kill all the monsters that are in your way. In the room you will have to perform a wall jump to grab the golden leaver. This will open a door to your right.</p>
<p>You will have to move slowly through the next doorway. Your controller will once again vibrate so be ready to perform a wall run to avoid falling into any gaps.</p>
<p>Make your way up the stairs (they&#8217;re located left) to make your way to the checkpoint.</p>
<p>You must watch out when you are running past the blades. Make sure you have hit the button on the wall to open the door  down to your left hand side,</p>
<p>You will then find yourself face to face with a huge monster! Who by the looks of things really doesn’t wait to fight on his own.<br />
You need to keep a close eye on this monster as he will try and distract you. Watch out for his arms. When he throws them to the floor (if you are not paying close attention) they will knock you over.<br />
You must then roll  when the monster charges at you. He will hit a wall and be in vulnerable state, go take your sward and slay him on his back. You will have to repeat this twice to defeat him.</p>
<p>In the door on the right hand side are three sand statues, there is also a button, do a wall run to press the button. This will trigger a section of the wall to move forward. Once the wall is in place you can perform another wall run to get across to the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>Perform a wall run to the golden lever on your right, then swing across some posts before landing on the other side.</p>
<p>Once you go through the walkway, watch out for the beam of spikes, roll underneath them.</p>
<p>Once you have made it to the other side via the wooden beam you will need drop down and move over to the right side to move out of the beams way.</p>
<p>You will have to roll over two more metal grates, make sure you time your rolls.<br />
When you walk through the walkway the prince will inform you that the  button to your right is stuck., turn the leaver and press the button once again.</p>
<p>The prince will also tell you that the gears are broken, for this puzzle you will need to go and get two small gears. They are located in the bottom right hand corner. In order to do this puzzle, you will need to put the leavers in the right order. Start with the level on your left (this lever should be facing east) and the next lever should be facing the prince (to the south) and finally the left lever should be pointed to the north. Remember you will have to arrange them in an “L” shape.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the puzzle go and step on the button.</p>
<p>There are some bricks on the right hand side of the wall, perform a wall jump to grab the bricks. Once you have completed two more wall jumps you will make it to a wooden crate.<br />

<p>When you have finished talking to Malik, the next puzzle is waiting for you. </p>
<p>This time there are three levers. You will have to move the gear right through the channel towards the small gear on the left hand side.<br />
Once it&#8217;s in place you can turn the small gear to the left to activate the gates mechanism.</p>
<p>Push the lever on the left hand side to move the gear along to its correct position.</p>
<p>Go back to the right lever and rotate it to the centre right L-shaped arms into position</p>
<p>now you must go back to the left lever and move the gear into its correct position.</p>
<p>Move the centre lever and rotate the centre and left L-shaped arms into the correct position. </p>
<p>Move back to the left lever and roll the gear along the channel to the correct position (against the small gear on the left).</p>
<p>now you must move the centre and left L-shaped arm away from the small gear, you can do this by moving the centre lever into position.</p>
<p>Finally you will need to move to the left lever, rotate the small gear. These two gears will now mesh and rotate. Allow you to close the gates.</p>
<p>Once you have unlocked the gears Malik will appear on a balcony. Just off the wooden platform attached to the large gear, climb up the exposed bricks, you will need to perform a vertical wall jump to get to the next set of bricks.</p>
<p>There is a circular switch which is located above the last set of bricks, wall run to activate the switch. This will cause the large gear to turn, taking the wooden platform up into a higher position. You must act quick before the gear takes the platform back to its original position. </p>
<p>You must then enter the newly opened gate, making your way past the metal spikes.</p>
<p>You must be careful when you make your way through the hallway,  you must time your rolls so you don&#8217;t bump into any spikes along the way.</p>
<p>You will eventually arrive at a door (a liquid door), when you enter the door you will meet Queen Razia again. Jump across the streams of water, treat them like poles (use your new control the water power).</p>
<p>For the next obstacle will be to freeze the water and crate three solid columns for you to swing across. You will have to hurry before they turn back into water.</p>
<p>Keep jumping across your frozen water columns until you make your way to the prisons.</p>

<p>You will need to freeze the waterfall, run up jumping to the water pole.</p>
<p>You will then need to make your way back to the waterfall. Jumping to the left.</p>
<p>You will then need to swing across to the ledge.</p>

<p>Once you have made it across the waterfalls you will need to walk through the doorway.</p>
<p>You will need to kill all the sand monsters, when you have made it down the path. If you really can&#8217;t be bothered to kill them you can always use your flight attack to soar over the sand monsters.</p>
<p>When you have made it to the next room, turn to the left. Flight attack to the bird and jump onto the frozen water pole.</p>
<p>Flight attack in a circle, over the birds, and perform a flight attack to the sand monsters on the ledge.</p>

<p>After Ratash swings at you again you will slide down the platform, you will need to perform a flight attack over the three birds.</p>
<p>Once you have landed you will slide down the platform, flight attack across three more birds.</p>
<p>You will land again and slide down another platform, be ready to jump over to a pole.</p>
<p>Swing across and flight attack over the four birds. </p>
<p>You will have reached the point now where it is time to take on Ratash.</p>
<p>Kill the first group of sand monsters. Remember to push him over the edge.</p>
<p>Next he will try and swing at you with his left hand. You need to be moving all the time, even performing a few rolls here and there.</p>
<p>When he starts to pull his hand up, you will quickly need to roll towards him. Using your power attacks at his chest.</p>
<p>Remember not to stay to close to him, otherwise he will take a swing at you, remember to roll out of his way.</p>
<p>When he blows fire, use the rolls to get out of the way.</p>
<p>Once Ratash&#8217;s health gets down to halfway, he will press both of his large claws into the sides of the platform. Stay in the middle and roll towards his chest, performing a few more power attacks.</p>
<p>When Ratash&#8217;s bar is almost empty, you will need to be a bit more patient. He will throw more fire and sand monsters. </p>
<p>You will finally need to flight attack across two birds and sit back and relax as the Prince finishes the battle against Ratash.</p>

I was further along in the game, died and when the save reset it brought me back to the same point as you mentioned.  I&#8217;d already cleared this area and now I&#8217;m stuck.  The game won&#8217;t respawn the enemies so I can kill then and advance the story.  This is BS!  I have no desire to replay from the start again, there&#8217;s a good chance this is going up on eBay unless there&#8217;s a solution.</p>

But it&#8217;s the same as what&#8217;s on the Ubi forum, not a real fix.</p>
<p>If you guys are still experiencing this problem, where you get stuck after falling down, even after loading up the auto-save; then please me know. On Monday I&#8217;ll contact Ubisoft to ask for an official statement, because I agree that they should fix this with a patch/update to the game.</p>

Using the backup save put me back at the start of the Dijin city.  I did have all my powers and upgrades.  I&#8217;ve made it to the final climb and the save seems to be holding.  I&#8217;ve died and respawned from an autosave and now things appear to be working.  This still shouldn&#8217;t be happening, Ubisoft needs to fix as you said.</p>

I have noticed a difference between the Xbox version and the PS3 version during the initial start of the final climb. In the Xbox version there looks to be an actual bar on the other side of the falling water once you start the initial jumping sequence. That would have been really helpful in the PS3 version, because that bar is actually shooting water. I don&#8217;t know how many times I ended up rewinding, but I know I died enough times to consider throwing the controller. Finally got through and screamed my head off. Of course, without your initial help, I would have not figured out the jumping strictly helped better than jumping &#8211; wall-running. So thanks!</p>

It&#8217;s the best fix available right now and should only set you back a little in the game.</p>
<p>With that you at least don&#8217;t have to start all over again. I emailed our contact at Ubisoft this week, but have not received a response back if there will be a patch/update to fix this problem or not.</p>

all in all i found this game pretty easier than all the other persia&#8217;s but it&#8217;s the strange plot what got me a bit o.O<br />
But either way the prince looks realistic for once and the gameplay wasn&#8217;t all that bad <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':-D' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
But the leading upto the final boss stage.. i hunted everywhere on youtube for a vid of how to do the water climbing freeze thingies and kept on failing got so mad i threw my controller! <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif' alt=':-o' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
But thankyou! you have now shown me how its done, and i have mastered your moves <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' />  i have gotten the grip of that water fall backflipping to the eagle! <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' />  before over and over again.. i just kept running up the frozen water trying to aim for the pole in front! :-0<br />
Im so stupid <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' /><br />
So thankyou gamesblogger guy <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':-P' class='wp-smiley' />  you have saved me!<br />
And i have enjoyed your walkthrough, you spoken clear, vid was great <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Thanks again ^_^</p>

<p>I&#8217;m having trouble in Level 13 &#8211; the throne room. Have made it to the top of the building, navigated to the next building where there are (well should be) chambers of water flowing from the ceiling. However, these chambers flow only intermittently so I can&#8217;t freeze time and jump from column to column. Have I done something wrong here? In your excellent videos, the stream of water is constant.</p>
<p>Many thanks and I look forward to hearing from you when you have a chance.</p>
<p>Naomi</p>

But it&#8217;s the same as what&#8217;s on the Ubisoft forum where you get your own automatic save file to work again, so not a real fix.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not stuck at the end of the game, and instead early in the game at the prison, then you most likely got a pirated copy. If you want to get the game to work, buy a legal copy that will allow you to play through the entire game. Steam (for PC &#038; Mac) has it on 33% discount until July 4:<br />

<p>I would be very happy if you could help me solve my problem. I&#8217;m stuck at Royal chambers level. After evading Ratash I came to room with a fountain and 2 waterfalls.. I jumped and wallruned to the top of the waterfall and made my way to the golden ledge that should open the door in front of it.. but nothing happens when I jump on it&#8230; Did I miss something or it&#8217;s a game bug ?.. By the way, I&#8217;m sorry for my English <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

I am using your walk-through.  On part 16 and hit a slight problem.<br />
Please check your video and confirm for me that at 5 mins and 5 secs there is a water pillar after the second water pole and not a water wall. It keeps loading a water wall for me making the jump to the ledge impossible and if i freeze the i hit a wall and die anyway. </p>
<p>Suggestions please</p>
<p>thanks john</p>

after fighting with the creatures and then switching the 2 pressure switches on either side, which shows a bar, i wall run on the wall to grab the bar, which is supposed to open the Gate in front of me. But the Gate does not open. i kill all the Summoners and the remaining sand creatures, but still the Gate does not open. i am stuck here&#8230;</p>
<p>can anyone help me with this problem. waiting for your replies&#8230;!!!</p>

Have made it to the top of the building, navigated to the next building where there are (well should be) chambers of water flowing from the ceiling. However, these chambers flow only intermittently so I can’t freeze time and jump from column to column. Have I done something wrong here?&#8221;</p>

You rock dude..<br />
What a nice compilation of the video walkthrough. And a special mention to the little chit &#8211; chat you do while playing the game. It makes watching the walkthrough even more interesting. At times I go through watching the entire stuff just to listen you talk <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /><br />

As you said, the trap are a big pain in the ass so i got killed and couldn´t rewind, so here comes the problem&#8230; the checkpoint is in front of the door you open pulling the lever where you balance, but guess what, it´s closed and you can´t go back to pull it again&#8230; I tried jumping to it but I keep falling, I tried dropping safely but I also die&#8230; Please, can you help me? I can´t go through and I simply don´t want do start it over again&#8230;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the only way anyone&#8217;s been able to get past that part, because Ubisoft protected their game with an in-game glitch for those who didn&#8217;t pay for it. Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, though.</p>

                        <div id="dsq-comment-message-844836" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for the vids. They were a lifesaver &#8211; or at least a time saver &#8211; for a couple of the puzzles. I&#8217;m at the Final Climb where you have to jump from a water column through like 5 waterfalls. Of course it&#8217;s timed to make the impossible&#8230; well&#8230; really impossible. I&#8217;m sure if I devoted many hours to it I could get it but that&#8217;s more frustration than fun. When I start cussing it isn&#8217;t a good indicator the game&#8217;s much fun.</p>
<p>Which is to say my feelings are mixed about the Prince of Persia series. This is the 2nd game in the series I&#8217;ve played and it looks like I&#8217;ll go 0 for 2 completing them which is a rarity. I almost never don&#8217;t play a game through to the end.</p>
<p>Great graphics and sound. Throw-away story line. When the game play is good it&#8217;s really good. However, at its worse like some of the traps (hate the swinging spike logs) and a few tedious gymnastics awkward on a PS3 controller &#8211; like these waterfall jumps &#8211; it&#8217;s one of the most frustrating games I&#8217;ve ever played. Why pay to get frustrated?</p>
<p>I dropped down to easy mode but I don&#8217;t see any really difference. In my humble opinion, the game developer needs to rethink the difficulty levels.</p>
<p>At least I didn&#8217;t buy the game. Rented it through Blockbuster on-line so it&#8217;s no loss. Just bundle it up and send it back.</p>

                        <div id="dsq-comment-message-844848" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Okay, I lied. I just finished the game. Gave it a few more &#8216;college tries&#8217;. Though I needed help 1 more time. There&#8217;s a confusing bit where there are 3 waterfalls parallel to the wall. There&#8217;s a vulture out of sight so I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to beat it without a quick peak at your video.</p>
<p>The rest of the game is easy as pie. No rewinds. The graphics are a rush and worth playing through but the combat is way too easy. Just an excuse to earn trophies.</p>
<p>Which is my final comment on the game. I realize this isn&#8217;t a hack &#8216;n slash style game primarily but I think it could do with a bit more combat and make it tad more challenging. The combat is as easy as the gymnastics is devilishly hard. No balance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m packing it in. Once through is enough.</p>

Loved it! <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>My problem would be the palace point, (part 26), where the 3 summoners come in. I&#8217;m not able to open the door on the second floor. You mentioned some kinda patch in the walkthrough. Do help in that mate. Its so frsutrating to come so close and get blocked! <img src='http://www.videogamesblogger.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif' alt=':|' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

We are aware of an issue in which auto-saves are not updating properly or saving at inappropriate times.</p>
<p>We are currently testing the patch that will solve this issue and are working fast to have it live as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have a workaround which is based on fail-safes built into the game code.</p>
<p>If you are stuck and reloading your auto-save is not an option, you can quickly revert to a back-up save and continue playing from the last time you visited Razia. This way, you can proceed with a minimum loss of progress.</p>
<p>Here is the procedure for Xbox 360:</p>
<p>1.Enter System Settings from the Xbox 360 Dashboard</p>
<p>2.Select Memory from the list</p>
<p>3.Choose &#8220;All Devices&#8221; from the list</p>
<p>4.Select &#8220;Games&#8221; from the list</p>
<p>5.Choose &#8220;Prince of Persia: TFS&#8221;</p>
<p>6.Select the first &#8220;Autosave&#8221; and delete it</p>

1. From the dash board go to “My Xbox”<br />
2. Scroll to System Settings (Far Right)<br />
3. Choose “memory”<br />
4. Open your storage device<br />
5. Choose Games<br />
6. Select “Prince of Prince:TFS” </p>
<p>PS3<br />
1. From the XMB scroll to the games menu<br />
2. Open the save data utility folder<br />
3. Locate prince of Persia: TFS</p>
<p>You most likely have an “Auto Save” file and a “Backup Autosave” file. You can try deleting the “Auto Save” and then starting the game and choosing “Continue” allowing it to load from the backup autosave file. This will hopefully take you to an earlier point in the game that you can continue from.”<br />
 If you&#8217;re playing pc search google for a prince of persia patch there are some un official patchs that will fix this bug.</p>

                        <div id="dsq-comment-message-902532" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is an enjoyable walkthrough for several reasons.<br />
One: It reveals the human side of game playing, those little slip ups now and again we all make.  I mean really how many are such perfect gamers they can create a visual walthrough and not screw up once in awhile?  Perhaps in that perfect gaming world and only video cipping the &#8220;non mistake&#8221; scenarios to string together as one continous section.</p>
<p>Two: there&#8217;s a sense of humor that helps make the challenge of the game itself less stressing as they often can be.<br />
A game should be FUN, not too easy but not so hard as to make one want to do a Flamenco dance on the controller or game disc or both in some cases.</p>
<p>Jester, I simply enjoy your style so rock on with it and would enjoy seeing more walkthroughs from you on other games in the future.<br />
Kind regards, Jeff.</p>

But i forgot. And yea, i fixed that now by lowering the level difficulty. But now again i have some problem with &#8220;The Tarrece&#8221; at ledges. Character is not grabing them. It&#8217;s at 4:45 at your video. I tried everything, it&#8217;s still keep dying. :/ So, if possible can help me in this. I will really appreciate that.

Firstly,thanks for the videos (you&#8217;re very helpful indeed)  and then to the point ^_^ &#8230; every time I was returned to a particular checkpoint the &#8220;upgrade available&#8221; notice kept showing so.. I killed my prince a dozen times and I got all the updates checked on my menu but I noticed I  -don&#8217;t- actually have them.. Is there a way to fix this without starting the game over again?<br />
P.S. Thats what people get 4 cheating ;G</p>
