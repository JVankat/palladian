				   I don't have nearly the Juice library of many of the people on the forum, so maybe my opinion doesn't matter as much. But I, too, was surprised and somewhat disappointed to read the purchase requirement in the newsletter. (Here's the <a href="http://www.digitaljuice.com/enewsletter/20060621_new_volumes_lastchance/20060621_new_volumes_lastchance_email_blast_online.htm" target="_blank">link</a>. ) <br>  <br> I'm not in the business. I &quot;Juice&quot; because it helps to make the videos I do for my family/church so much better. If I could take advantage of this offer, I would -- but like Fred, I've got stuff that I've not had the pleasure to use yet and nothing really jumped out at me in these volumes. <br>  <br> That I should be disqualified because from future offers because of this just doesn't seem to be the Digital Juice way.

				   I just got the email too.&nbsp; I'm kind of disappointed.&nbsp;  <br>  <br> I like Digital Juice and their customer support is fantastic.&nbsp; But I have an issue with trying to force your customers to buy a product.&nbsp; I have taken advantage of pretty much every deal that has been offered this year, even purchasing a couple of extra toolkits as a gift for my brother, who is just starting his own video business.&nbsp; I had intended to buy the $99 deal.&nbsp; However, I was kind of waiting and keeping an eye on how many were still available out of the first thousand.&nbsp; It was over 600 this morning. <br>  <br> I just dropped a ton of cash on car repairs this week.&nbsp; I was hoping to wait a week or so before purchasing.&nbsp; Instead I get an email that says you must buy this package before tomorrow night or you can't take advantage of the next one???? <br>  <br> Very tacky.&nbsp;

				   Apologies if people were offended.&nbsp; It was not intended to be that.&nbsp;  <br>  <br> As I wrote to Matt in another thread..the bottomline is this.. This deal was too good and we can't afford to do it if only a few hundred people do it.&nbsp; I am forced to end this deal this week and wanted to reward those customers who did take advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>  <br> I stand by my long and extensive record of unbeatable deals.&nbsp; If you didn't like this deal there is usually another one coming around the corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br>  <br> I'm still in the process of figuring out how to make these great prices actually work out for everyone, Juice included.&nbsp; I want to continue, but it only works with SUPER HIGH volume.&nbsp; Maybe we don't have a big enough of customer base yet to sustain it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>  <br> I think you guys should give me a tad more slack on this issue.. Ok, the pressure was too much for some of you.. but it is a GREAT DEAL.

				   If the deal didn't work very well (which for that price I am a little amaxed myself) then why even offer it again?&nbsp; even to those few who did like it.&nbsp; The chances of them all liking the next one are very remote and then you make even fewer sales.&nbsp; I can understand wanting to can the deal for lack of interest but if you are going to can it then just can it and contiue with the $69 entry price for the first 1000.&nbsp; It is still a steal and your financial folks don't have to scream at you for the bottom out prices with no profit that you put out there.&nbsp;  <br>  <br> But, as I said if the products had been a little different then I would have been one of the buyers. <br>  <br> Do what you gotta do Dave.&nbsp; We know the deals will keep coming and that keeps us coming back.&nbsp; Just don't throw us out for not buying into this deal. <br>  <br> So, when is that All Church II coming out?&nbsp; Right before the Worship Toolkit...correct?

				   Dave, it is an amazing Deal, I just think we where all a little shocked to see this from you guys, your customer service and products are the best I have seen anywhere, and you have never done anything like this. It struck a chord even more for the customers like me who have bought every other deal except this one and now we are punnished for it. At least we looked at it as punnishment, you looked at it as a reward for people who bought it. If I bought it I would be happy you rewarded me. <br> No hard feelings, I think if you would have explained the reasoning in the email it wouldn't have been as bad, or maybe advertised it as a bonus reward for ordering this weeks deal. That would be better than saying if you don't buy it you cant get the next one. <br> Any hints on what the next ones are?[;)]

				   Thanks for responding David.&nbsp; I agree it is a great deal, and I fully understand your need to end it early. <br>  <br> What surpised me was the line in your email&nbsp; &quot;Only the customers that buy this bundle will be offered a similiar bundle for the next Jump Backs and Stacktraxx.&nbsp; Don't say we didn't warn you!&quot; <br>  <br> As a customer, what I interpret it as is &quot;You either buy this product NOW, or we when the next deal rolls around - you will be punished for not purchasing and we will not let you participate in our new bundle deal&quot; <br>  <br>  <br> Maybe this wasn't your intention, but as a customer that is how I took it and I don't think I'm alone.&nbsp; After reading the email I immediately jumped to your forums to ask about it and already found a thread started on the subject. <br>  <br> Again, I appreciate the deals.&nbsp; I just thought the wording in the email was a little harsh. <br>

				   I also wanted to ad, that the deal was GREAT, I think this one might not have worked as well because of the product, it's good but nothing really jumped out at me, and the music is kind of a repeat of the first two volumes, so it might not be a big seller. Even not liking that much in it I almost bought it because of the deal. <br> I also have spent a ton of money the last few months and was going to take a break, maybe a monthly deal would work better. I'm sure you will work it all out.

				   So we still have time to sway you one way or the other.&nbsp; I say make it a 2 for $99 and bundle those two products together.&nbsp; The HD stuff is still very limited, both in the number of people sho have them and the number that can/are using them.&nbsp; So don't throw one of them in there.&nbsp; Just the STX&nbsp;15 and the JB 32 for $99 and open it to all.  <br>  <br>

				   Ok I have calmed down a bit and I actually just talked to Mike in sales and placed my order.  <br> I do have to say that once again Digital Juices Service is unmatched, by anyone anywhere. And now you can ad great Service recovery to the list. I was a pissed off customer and I put a complaint up on the forums, within minutes I had an explanation from the CEO, explained what was done and why, and gave a preview of what was to come. Within a half an hour I had placed my order and now I am happy because when the new deal comes out it will be a great price and the stuff I just ordered, I look at it as if it where a bonus.  <br> You have me back completely, thanks for the deals, thanks for the quick responses, thanks for the great products, and thanks for the service. <br> Matt

				   I just got my $99 deal delivered today. I dont have a lot of these, and yeah, I saw the price of this package and couldnt pass it up. The wife wasnt too happy, but I told her it was too good not to get. For me, I could use every little bit that I can, so what a deal it was. Hope to see more of these types of deals in the future, as budget wise, it is a great way to get some fantastic products. More ETK's are inline for me though in the future. I need more!!! LOL  <br>

				   I can't believe&nbsp;anybody would ask them NOT to include somethig they're already offering.&nbsp; These deals have been awsome.&nbsp; I bought this one just because it is so good.&nbsp; I didn't need these volumes either but at $99 how can anyone offord not to.&nbsp; I think that's the mentality they were hoping for but didn't get.&nbsp; Maybe it&nbsp;SHOULD BE&nbsp;the MOST LOYAL customers that get these insane deals.&nbsp; I've put myself through a lot pain to fund all of these deals but am glad I did.&nbsp; I now have many more tools to help make my business grow.&nbsp; At these prices we should all be purchasing.&nbsp; I hope the lack of sales on this one doesn't prompt a decrease in offers.&nbsp; Thank you Digital Juice! <br>  <br> On a side note, why don't we hear from those lucky package winners here?&nbsp; Talk about ungrateful... I would be shouting to the world how great DJ is (like I don't already, lol)!

				   Shannon, <br> I don't disagree with your&nbsp; statement that Digital Juice deals should be for the most loyal customers.&nbsp; However, I personally feel that just because I didn't want to rush to take part in the current deal - that does not make me *NOT* a loyal customer. <br>  <br> I don't know exactly how many juice products you own, but I have spent a tiny fortune on them in the past few months.&nbsp; I really dislike the idea that I should be punished for not purchasing the current deal.&nbsp;  <br>  <br> Just to give you an idea of what I have spent since this past October, I am listing my entire Juice Library: <br>  <br>  <br>   Editorâ€™s Toolkit 1 <br> Editorâ€™s Toolkit&nbsp; 2 <br> Editorâ€™s Toolkit&nbsp; 3 <br> Editorâ€™s Toolkit&nbsp; 4  <br>  Editorâ€™s Toolkit&nbsp; 5 <br> Editorâ€™s Toolkit&nbsp; 6  <br>  Editorâ€™s Toolkit&nbsp; 7 <br> Editorâ€™s Toolkit&nbsp; 8 <br> Editorâ€™s Toolkit&nbsp; 9 <br> Editorâ€™s Toolkit&nbsp; 10 <br> &nbsp;  Stacktraxx&nbsp; 1 <br> Stacktraxx 2 <br> Stacktraxx&nbsp; 3 <br> Stacktraxx 4 <br> Stacktraxx&nbsp; 5 <br> Stacktraxx 6 <br> Stacktraxx&nbsp; 7 <br> Stacktraxx 8 <br> Stacktraxx 9 <br> Stacktraxx 10 <br> Stacktraxx&nbsp; 11 <br> Stacktraxx 13 <br>  <br> Sound FX   <br>  <br> Backtraxx 2  &nbsp;   <br>  <br> HD JumpBacks 1   <br> HD JumpBacks 2   <br> HD JumpBacks 3   <br> HD JumpBacks 4 <br> HD JumpBacks 5 <br> HD JumpBacks 6   <br> HD JumpBacks 7   <br> HD JumpBacks 8   <br> HD JumpBacks 9   <br> HD JumpBacks 10  &nbsp;   <br>  <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 1   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 2   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 3   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 4   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 5   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 6   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 7   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 8   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 9   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 10   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 11   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 12   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 13   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 14   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 15   <br> Jump Backs 16&nbsp;   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 17   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 18   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 19   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 20   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 21   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 22   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 23   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 24   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 25   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 26   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 27   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 28 <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 29   <br> Jump Backs&nbsp; 30  &nbsp;   <br>  <br> Juice Drops 1   <br> Juice Drops 2    <br> Juice Drops 3   <br> Juice Drops 4    <br> Juice Drops 5    <br> Juice Drops 6    <br> Juice Drops 7    <br> Juice Drops 8   <br> Juice Drops 9   <br> Juice Drops 10   <br> Juice Drops 11   <br> Juice Drops 12   <br> Juice Drops 13   <br> Juice Drops 14 <br> Juice Drops 15   <br> Juice Drops 16   <br> Juice Drops 17   <br> Juice Drops 18   <br> Juice Drops 19   <br> Juice Drops 20   <br> Juice Drops 21   <br> Juice Drops 22   <br> Juice Drops 23 <br> Juice Drops 24   <br> Juice Drops 25   <br> Juice Drops 26   <br> Juice Drops 27    <br> Juice Drops 28   <br> Juice Drops 29   <br> Juice Drops 30   <br> Juice Drops 31   <br> Juice Drops 32   <br> Juice Drops 33   <br> Juice Drops 34   <br> Juice Drops 35   <br> Juice Drops 36   <br> Juice Drops 37    <br> Juice Drops 38  &nbsp;    <br>

				   I would say that you fall into the most loyal catagory.&nbsp; And no, you shouldn't be punished nor do I think DJ&nbsp;WOULD punish you if you called asked for the next deal.&nbsp; I've been able to take advantage of some under the table deals in the past because of my purchase history (thank you DJ!).&nbsp; Bottom line, I'm sure DJ will always take of customers like you.&nbsp; Before jumping on the wagon and ranting here maybe you should have contacted DJ and asked them about it personally.&nbsp; I know they would have been accomidating.

				   Truthfully, I don't want to have to call sales.&nbsp; I've called them in the past to get a scratched disc replaced - they were incredibly helpful.&nbsp; But still, I would rather just order online.&nbsp; I prefer the ease of visiting a website clicking on what I want and having it show up a few days later.&nbsp; Maybe I'm in the minority, but I really dislike having to call customer service for any company. <br>  <br> My main point is, that I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars with Digital Juice in a few short months and I just don't like the idea of getting an email saying *You must purchase this deal by midnight tomorrow, or else you can't have the special pricing on our next deal* <br>  <br> As a customer, I find it insulting. <br>

				   Dave: Maybe one of the issues is that these deals are coming out too fast.&nbsp; Many people, myself included, are not major video corps and are not rich. If you were to spread out your deals to once every couple of weeks or once per month, you might see more people take advantage of it as it allows our wallets to recover.  <br>   <br>  I was prepared to buy STX14 for the previous $69 deal and then this came along. I don't need the HD, but it was basically getting it for free.&nbsp; I took advantage of it before the &quot;buy or else warning&quot;, but was suprised to see the line added at the last minute so to speak.&nbsp;  <br>   <br>  I think that throwing in the extra item will help sales down the road. I never would buy an HD bundle until I was sure I was going into HD. By getting the HD11 as part of this, I can try it out.&nbsp; The same goes for the Juice Drops. I don't do print and probably would not buy it on my own, but if offered in a deal with a stx or JB, I might be more inclined to buy one and try it out. If it works out for what I do, then you have me sold on buying more of your product.  <br>   <br>  Keep up the deals!  <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>

				   I place my orders by phone, sometimes they do offer ad ons you don't see when you order on the web, and you get to talk to some good people, Mike and Natalie are both great, thats the people I always seem to get and it's nice to talk to them. Web is probably easier and cheaper for them, but I can't order from the web on my work computer, so I usually call.

				   Please don't slow down on the deals even if I can't keep up.&nbsp; Yeah, it'll kill me to miss one but I'd rather have them available than not. <br>  <br> Matt, I agree about the phone deals and working with Mike.&nbsp; In fact, every time I call I make it a point ask if I'm missing ANY other deals (thanks for the latest deal Mike).&nbsp; I would think that DJ has made at least another $500 from me over the years with the under the table deals.&nbsp; Please keep those up guys!
