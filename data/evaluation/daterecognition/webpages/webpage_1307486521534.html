Picture: Getty Images<br /><br />Professor Kevin Anderson, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change, believes only around 10 per cent of the planet's population – around half a billion people – will survive if global temperatures rise by 4C.<br /><br />Anderson's warning comes just eight days before global leaders meet in Copenhagen for the most crucial talks on climate change reversal since the Rio summit in 1992. Current Met Office projections reveal that the lack of action in the intervening 17 years – in which emissions of climate changing gases such as carbon dioxide have soared – has set the world on a path towards potential 4C rises as early as 2060, and 6C rises by the end of the century.<br /><br />Anderson, who advises the government on climate change, said the consequences were "terrifying". <br /><br />"For humanity it's a matter of life or death," he said. "We will not make all human beings extinct as a few people with the right sort of resources may put themselves in the right parts of the world and survive.<br /><br />"But I think it's extremely unlikely that we wouldn't have mass death at 4C. If you have got a population of nine billion by 2050 and you hit 4C, 5C or 6C, you might have half a billion people surviving."<br /><br />Efforts at the Copenhagen summit, which starts on 7 December,  will focus on action to instead keep temperature rises to no more than 2C – generally accepted as the threshold for dangerous climate change. However, with growing pessimism that a binding agreement on emissions reduction targets will be reached, Anderson warned time was running out.<br /><br />If ambitious global targets for reductions have not been set by the end of next year, he believes it will be too late to stop emissions rising beyond 2C.<br /><br />Last week, Britain and France urged the wealthiest nations  to set aside $10 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries reduce the output of greenhouse gases.<br /><br />Scotland has set a 42 per cent emissions reduction target for 2020 but Anderson pointed out that even if this was achieved by rich nations throughout the world, it would only give a 60 per cent chance of avoiding a 2C global temperature increase.<br /><br />Despite pessimism over the past few weeks he was optimistic a legal agreement can still be reached at Copenhagen. He believes leaders are deliberately trying to lower expectations to increase the impact of any success at the summit.<br /><br />"The worst possible result at Copenhagen is a bad deal where the world leaders have to come home and say it's a good deal when its rubbish," he added.<br /><br />"That's the real danger – that they will feel under pressure to sign up to anything. That could lock us into something bad for the next ten years."<br /><br />Stewart Stevenson, Scotland's climate change minister, who will also be attending the summit, said: "Even quite moderate predictions do suggest that we will have vast movements of people around the world particularly on the borders of desert regions and that associated with that will be loss of life." <!---<br />MPUMinCharsCutOff:210   PageLength:3385<br />MPUPositionFromStart:250   MPUPositionRange:1000<br />hasVideoOrImage:False<br />---><br /><!--- NO IMAGE OR VIDEO ---><br /><!--- MPU DONE ---><br /></div><br />

A less hysterical reaction to the *possibility* of projected warming might at least still engage the majority of us in the value of future energy restrictions and planning. But this utterly HYSTERICAL, no make that BIBLICAL APOCOPLYPSE, scenario, is one which no rational person can possibly concur with.<br /><br />The man-made climate change movement is now looking like one of these people you see in the street with a billboard, handing out pamphlets and ranting that the world will end next week. Most of us will cross the road to avoid such people, and can only hope that if they keep taking their meds, they may one day return to sanity and rejoin the rest of us in getting on with life...<br /><br /></div>

There will be compound crisis' happening at the same time in our cosmos. Planet X will be returning from its 3600 year orbit around our solar system. Which will bring with it six orbiting satellites with it. This return of Planet X will disrupt our solar system, and especially Jupiter, Neptune, Uranus, Venus, and the Earth. Planet X will enter our solar system at the edge and cross orbits with Jupiter. Jupiter could ignite at this time and become a baby sun. Nibiru will pass between the Earth on the Sun. This will cause the two suns to be seen by everyone in the world. Everyday people will be able to view the two suns by May of 2011 the latest. <br />The 11 1/2 year solar flare cycle will peak on 2012 causing solar flares that can knock out power grids around the world. These solar flares in conjunction with the return of Planet X, will cause devastation on the earth. <br />The sun, earth, and milky way will align at the galactic equator, on December 21, 2012, the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, and the end of the Mayan calendar. This only happens every 25,800 years! For the first time in recorded history, our entire solar system will move BELOW the milky way galaxy. These combined cosmic events, will be the end of the world as we know it. About 6 billion people of the world will perish in just a few short years if this cosmic catastrophe occurs"<br /><br /><br /></div>

                              <div class="comment">"The great climate change science scandal"<br /><br />".....What those emails suggested, however, was that Jones and some colleagues may have become so convinced of their case that they crossed the line from objective research into active campaigning.<br /> In one, Jones boasted of using statistical "tricks" to obliterate apparent declines in global temperature. In another he advocated deleting data rather than handing them to climate sceptics. And in a third he proposed organised boycotts of journals that had the temerity to publish papers that undermined the message.<br /> It was a powerful and controversial mix — far too powerful for some. Real Climate is a website designed for scientists who share Jones’s belief in man-made climate change. Within hours the file had been stripped from the site.

                              <div class="comment">Climategate Foretold...<br />“• What is the current scientific consensus on the conclusions reached by Drs. Mann, Bradley and Hughes? [Referring to the hockey stick propagated in UN IPCC 2001 by Michael Mann.]<br />Ans: Based on the literature we have reviewed, there is no overarching consensus on MBH98/99.   As analyzed in our social network, there is a tightly knit group of individuals who passionately believe in their thesis. However, our perception is that this group has a self-reinforcing feedback mechanism and, moreover, the work has been sufficiently politicized that they can hardly reassess their public positions without losing credibility.”  <br />AD HOC COMMITTEE REPORT ON THE ‘HOCKEY  STICK’ GLOBAL CLIMATE RECONSTRUCTION, also known as The Wegman report was authored by Edward J. Wegman, George Mason University, David W. Scott, Rice University, and Yasmin H. Said, The Johns Hopkins University with the contributions of John T. Rigsby, III, Naval Surface Warfare Center, and Denise M. Reeves, MITRE Corporation.<br /></div>

They usually take them with the sun in the background so they look more like 'pollution'.  I have downloaded 5 or six this week.  It is the subliminal guilt trip.  Keep an eye out for it.  Fort McMurray oil sands plants look really nasty at 40 below.  It's only steam; the only significant GHG!<br /><br />The CO2 footprint of oil sand(if it mattered a hoot) is 4% of Canada's 2% of the world's 2% which amounts to 5 parts per billion of the natural 390 parts per million.  That 5 ppb is being attacked by Greenpeace.  </div>

                              <div class="comment">The whole argument is blatantly false.<br /><br />Firstly the photo in the editorial is showing cooling steam not smoke—what a laugh.<br /><br />Secondly the only way to stop CO2 is to shut down all the sources of hydrocarbon fuels. That is the coal fields, oil & gas fields. The West going for renewable sources will not stop the rest of the World (overall majority) using hydrocarbons.<br />A 9 billion population will cause shortage of resources and many other problems far worse than global warming—(without hydrocarbons it will be impossible to feed the multitudes). It is very likely that humanity will do the dirty at the end of the day and have a neutron bomb war or the likes.<br /> <br />One thing for absolute certainty, global warming is not only caused by CO2.<br /></div>

Let's go for a walk<br />along it. *<br /><br /> <br />*The first 770 metres are Nitrogen.*<br /> <br /><br />*The next 210 metres are Oxygen.*<br /><br /><br />*That's 980 metres of the 1 kilometre.  20 metres to go.*<br /> <br /><br />*The next 10 metres are water vapour.  10 metres left.*<br /><br /> <br /><br />*9 metres are argon.   Just 1 more metre.*<br /><br /> <br /><br />*A few gases make up the first bit of that last metre.*<br /><br /> <br /><br />*The last 38 centimetres of the kilometre - that's carbon dioxide.  A<br />bit over one foot.*<br /><br /> <br />*97% of that is produced by Mother Nature.  It?'s natural.*<br /><br /> <br />*Out of our journey of one kilometre, there are just 12 millimetres<br />left.  Just over a centimetre - about half an inch. *<br /><br /> <br />*That?s the amount of carbon dioxide that global human activity puts<br />into the atmosphere.*<br /><br /> <br />*And of those 12 millimetres Australia puts in .18 of a millimetre.*<br /><br /> <br />*Less than the thickness of a hair.

                              <div class="comment">I note that dear old Kev Anderson appears oblivious to the implications of Climategate. Let me remind him that the AGW hypothesis depended on complex modelling with data sets for recent decades (which were known to contain major deficiencies) and limited proxy data such as tree-ring growth for earlier periods. It also depended on doubtful assumptions about the relationship with those proxies and prevailing temperature. It is now known that some of the proxies indicated falling temperatures from 1960-99, suggesting that the assumed relationship was false. What the dodgy crew at Hadley/CRU/UEA and others did was to eliminate this observed "divergence" from their data sets. The scientific community expects that data used for modelling is made available for examination by others. In this way other scientists in the field can test if the results are replicable. When the CRU and their chums denied access to their data red warning flags were hoisted throughout the scientific community. From that point on all claims that there was a consensus within the scientific community became entirely bogus. The disastrous leak at the CRU demonstrated that their modelling contains such severe faults that it cannot even be replicated by the CRU, let alone independent statisticians. Much of the raw data apparently no longer exists, and the data sets have been subjected to so many fudges that no one can fully explain their merit. This could hardly be more damaging in the run-up to Copenhagen since the CRU played such a key role in the UN reports. All of the absurdly expensive anti-CO2 measures tendered by the likes of my Lord Stern really need to be put on hold until these serious data and modelling issues are satisfactorily resolved. </div>

The revised figures were kept, but the originals — stored on paper and magnetic tape — were dumped to save space when the CRU moved to a new building.”<br />In a statement on its website, the CRU said: “We do not hold the original raw data but only the value-added (quality controlled and homogenised) data.”<br />The CRU is the world’s leading centre for reconstructing past climate and temperatures.

                              <div class="comment">Egad sir, You got in before me! Quite right, Anderson is not a Climate Scientist but an engineer: Anderson's bio at Manchester Tyndall: Research Director of Tyndall-Manchester's Energy and Climate Change programme and manager of the Tyndall Centre's energy pathways to global decarbonisation programme. <br /><br />Kevin is based in the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering at the University of Manchester and is an honorary lecturer in Environmental Management at the Manchester Business School. <br /><br />"Managing and understanding the linkages between the disparate projects demands a genuinely interdisciplinary approach, synthesising, for example, highly technical electrical power systems research with conceptually demanding interpretations of equity and carbon emissions scenarios for the UK's energy system." <br /><br />Conceptually demanding interpretations? This is just claptrap. <br /><br />He is certainly not researching climate, he starts from the view point that Global Warming as per IPCC is a given and then proceeds to play computer games around it. <br /><br />IPCC says that global temperature rose by 0.7degC since 1850. Thank goodness it has, because we were in the depths of the Little Ice Age for 500 years before then, when temperatures were up to 2 degrees colder than today. <br /><br />Who decides what the correct temperature of the Earth should be? Surely it shouldn't be what it was in 1850, we would be using massive amounts of energy for heating if it were. <br /><br />They also say that it is very likely that humans have caused the temperature rise over the last fifty years. <br /><br />Strange thing is that for the UK, annual temperature fifty years ago in 1959, was 10.48deg C. In 2008 UK annual temperature was 10.02 deg C. In that time atmospheric CO2 has risen by 22%. <br /><br />Will someone please tell me how a) a 0.46 degree fall in temperature is global warming and b)If CO2 drives temperature, why hasn't it?<br /><br />And yes, the Scotsman is studiously avoiding Climategate.</div>

                              <div class="comment">With one or two exceptions the above comments illustrate what happens when people are confronted by something they don't want to believe: mostly simple denial without any substance or reason, with occasionally some incorrect piece of information that is meant to bolster their statement, but actually shows how misinformed they are.<br /><br />For example, #2 Yok Finney states, "I'll need to examine data for the southern hemisphere but the northern is definitely quietely cooling."<br /><br />Well, Yok, if you had examined the data for the southern hemisphere, you would have found that the last three months (Sept./Oct/Nov.) in the southern hemisphere are on course to being the WARMEST ever recorded for that time of year, and they follow a three month period (Jun./Jul./Aug.) which was almost equal warmest with 1998. See:<br /><br />http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata/SH.Ts+dSST.txt<br /><br />As for the northern hemisphere: the last three months (Sept./Oct/Nov.) in the northern hemisphere are on course to being the fourth warmest ever recorded for that time of year, and they follow a three month period (Jun./Jul./Aug.) which was fifth warmest. See:<br /><br />http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata/NH.Ts+dSST.txt<br /><br />Globally, the six months ending November 2009 look as though they may be on course to be the WARMEST June-November period ever recorded (since 1880), according to the NASA GISS series.  see:<br /><br />http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt <br /><br />The main reason for the rapid increase in temperatures during the last year has been the development of an El Nino in the Pacific - such short time periods tell us nothing about anthropogenic global warming one way or another.<br /><br />But what IS significant about such data is that AGW deniers like Yok cannot even bring themselves to acknowledge the incontrovertible fact that the Earth is now warming rapidly. In the face of evidence that shows the opposite, Yok states that, "the northern [hemisphere] is definitely quietely cooling".<br /><br />H</div>

Followers of the AGW cult like yourself, spouting the results of so called research by a 40 strong group producing self "peer reviewed" papers and running a George Soros financed web site, realclimate, are now being exposed as morally bankrupt. </div>

'adjusted' the raw temperature data to hide the Medieval Warm Period and produce 'false warming' at the end of the 20thCentury<br /><br />b. Hid the global decline in temperature since 1998<br /><br />c. Colluded to wreck the careers of scientists who disagreed<br /><br />d. Conspired to get sceptical papers censored and banned from publication<br /><br />e. physically threatened other sceptics<br /><br />f. Colluded with Mann, Hansem et al about how to hide data and oppose Freedom of Information Act requests<br /><br />g.Destroyed original temperature data files to prevent sceptics being able to check their analysis.<br /><br />The dominoes are tumbling.  There is a huge scandal in New Zealand where prima facie evidence has been found showing how their agency NIWA DELIBERATELY falsified temperature data.<br /><br />http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/11/27/more-on-the-niwa-new-zealand-data-adjustment-story/<br /><br />This is the greatest corruption of science scandal in our entire history; it will change the academic and governmental policy world for ever - once the truth is out.  Why have they done it?  Phil Jones received over £2.5 million in grants in recent years.  If they win they will literally tax the air you breathe; they will double the price of fuel and electricity' all in the name of their fantasy of 'world government'. <br /><br /></div>

Refusal to print any reference to the fact that 'climate change science' has no consensus and that there IS a conspiracy and widespread scientific fraud, puts them in the gutter press.

                              <div class="comment">Clearly the need for further propaganda prior to the Copenhagen climate shindig has sent Kevin Anderson into a form of Chicken Little mode, which Scotland on Sunday has decided to pass on unchecked. The hysterical ravings tell you what you need to know about this "science" which I always believed was founded on observation of fact and theories could be shown to be replicable, with the null hypothesis assumption being "there is no effect" rather than "there is to be a huge alarming effect and give us all your money". <br /><br />Ignoring Climategate and issuing propaganda without question indicates a poor standard of reporting and the BBC has to take its fair share of criticism for this too. Nowhere is AGW questioned in reports. Brown is allowed free rein to make all sorts of assertions about climate and its supposed cure, which involving Brown means £Bns for headlines and votes on the back of this bandwagon. In industry a proposal to spend billions would require careful planning and presentation of the case to hard-headed and realistic people. This looks like the back of a fag packet type plan "err, let's see - make deforestation 50% of the target and umm a few carbon credis here and there that ought to do it - (Keerrr--ching)".<br /><br />The greens truly cannot see the irony of world leaders flying to Trinidad and Copenhagen and staying in supreme comfort when they get there clocking up tonnes of CO2 in the process. Always assuming you believe all that is said about this trace gas causing the sky to fall in. Or maybe they do and are just happy to accept the grants and payouts to promote what seems to be the ideal tax opportunity. You don't have to  manufacture anything. You don't have to think that much because the grant recipients produce the data for you. Anyone seeing parallels with the housing market here? AGW saves all the fuss and bother of having to build up industry and commerce and understand things and produces cash and tax at an alarming rate of knots. </div>

                              <div class="comment">Wallace Thornhill writes:<br /><br />Since my last report I convened a meeting of people actively concerned with the Electric Universe and the problem of educating the public. Gaining attention for a simple electrical model of the universe is a problem because the media is devoted to the science fiction of the big bang. The noted astronomer, Fred Hoyle, wrote prophetically in Of Men and Galaxies (1964) “More and more the professions will cross over into the entertainment field. Those of us who are not employed directly in industry will come to realize that what we are really in is ‘show biz.’”<br /><br />This Universe is 99% Plasma (I underestimate) which has a conductivity = to copper. This naturally forms Birkland Filaments which light our stars. The idea that a nuclear fusion reator at the core is powering the Sun is plainly ludicrous. If you don't have a degree in electrical engineering and electronics, you're not understanding much at all.<br /><br />Fred Hoyle never claimed he had the entire model of Universe but always saw it as evolving as new OBSERVATIONS arrived which have always verified the preditions of model Electric Universe.<br /><br />Conventional astronomers peer group reviewed by their own kind still deny that quasars are clearly photographed IN FRONT of galaxies. not receding into the outer darkness at the Big Bang theorists insist. So we take away the big bang, black holes which have never been observed, dark matter, and have a realistic model which keeps making good predictions later confirmed.<br /><br />Weather, far less climate, is a complex matter which needs a wide range of disciplines to get any grip at all on it. If you don't have some understanding of electricity and magnetism as electrical engineers do, you're talking merely through a hole in your head.<br /><br />It's a purely mathematical construction which doesn't gell with observation and measurement. It's not science.<br /></div>

If we had real journalists on the job, they would have had great fun with his intemperate propaganda, and used the opportunity to share some real insights into climate variation and political opportunism.<br /><br />As it is, we get the SoS and Scotsman speciality of fat-tracked press releases.  In good time for the dark shame of Copenhagen I do note.<br /><br />If anything, the historical record over the shorts-term suggests were are in a cooling phase for say 20 or 30 years.  In the much longer term, who knows perhaps hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, we seem all but certain to face the next glaciation.  <br /><br />I wonder which direction of temperature movements, cooling or warming, would be most harmful?  I think cooling wins out hands-down.  Would not a more balanced piece of demented speculation not also considered an equal and opposite temperature trend into more cooling?  But the bandwagon does not allow it, and who can argue with the many tens of billions of dollars that bandwagon has amassed?<br /><br /></div>

You've got some nerve preaching this tripe now that WE KNOW the books have been cooked."<br /><br />Yes, well of course I expected some rabid comment of the kind that you have just provided. So, you imply we shouldn't trust the CRU data because of revelations from these hacked emails? That is utter nonsense. But even if it we were foolish enough to discard the CRU temperatures we still have the other three global temperature series (four if you include NCDC).<br /><br />And as far as my post (#52 & #53) is concerned I wasn't even quoting the CRU data (because it doesn't display seasonal data like NASA GISS and therefore was less appropriate to the point I was making) so your objection is not only ridiculous, it isn't even relevant.<br /><br />But if you want to find corroborative evidence for the fact that 2009 is warming rapidly compared with 2008, then you can use the two satellite series, UAH and RSS. One of these is even overseen by a well known AGW sceptic, Roy Spencer. So, what do those series tell us? Here is the evidence:<br /><br />The two satellite series, UAH and RSS both show that 2009 so far is considerably warmer than 2008.<br /><br />Here is the data:<br /><br />UAH anomaly<br />2008 +0.048C<br />2009 +0.234C (to October)<br />an increase of 0.186C<br /><br />RSS anomaly<br />2008 +0.092C<br />2009 +0.255C (to October)<br />an increase of 0.163C <br /><br />On a longer timescale, all four temperature series show similar, though not identical, results, see:<br /><br />http://cce.890m.com/temp-compare.jpg <br /><br /></div>

This phenomenon has been understood since about 1870. The cyclical range of CO2 has never been out with the range of 180 to 300ppm for the last 400,000 years. It is now over 380 and rising by approximately 2ppm per year.<br /><br />If you believe that current heating is part of a natural cycle then the effect of CO2 caused by human activity will be superimposed on top of that cycle making it even more critical that we stop adding to the problem. </div>

Unfortunately, because the ice cap is mainly on water instead of land (as in Antarctica), once the rate of summer melt starts to increase, it accelerates quite dramatically and I think that is the pattern that we are witnessing currently.  <br /><br />The Antarctic is different and indeed it is now known that the overall quantity of ice has not actually diminished but it has moved so that, while there has been a substantial reduction at the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea, this has been countered by greater accummulations on the other side of the continent.  The Peninsula/Weddell melt is, no doubt, the result of the same ocean warming that is affecting the North PPolar ice cap.<br /><br />However, it is interesting that ancient maps (including Piri Reis) of the South Atlantic show the outline of the Peninsula as we now know it to be under the ice.  This would imply that the Penisula/Weddell ice is relatively new.  It is also interesting that glacial core samples in Greenland have revealed Papyrus seeds - I'm not suggesting that Greenland once had the same climate as Egypt(!) but it probably shows that the entire wind system on the planet has changed dramatically over the past thousand years or so.  <br /><br />Nearer to home, the Romans grew vines at Callander but our winters, a few hundred years ago, were far more severe than those of today.<br /> <br />My point?  There is devastating evidence that the earth warms and cools as part of its natural cycle but there is no convincing evidence - other than contrived anecdotal - to support the views of scientists who are paid to present a case on behalf of their commercial sponsors.  Du Pont Industries and the refrigerant scandal of a few years ago is a good example.  <br /><br />One thing is certain though. We have to take concerted action to stop (no</div>

We have to take concerted action to stop (not just reduce, but stop) the appalling pollution of the oceans (the cooling towers in the photo are just releasing air and water so, ironically, they are completely harmless!).  This is definitely having a major effect on the planet's ability to sustain life in the future.  The current CO2 furore is little more than a very cynical red herring (to use an appropriate metaphor) to divert attention from the very real dangers that future generations will face.<br /><br />The agenda at Copenhagen is misguided at best.<br /> <br /><br /></div>

The scare of 'climate change' is a side issue that will divert funding from these crucial areas of conservation.</div>

"At present, however, the warming is taking a break," confirms meteorologist Mojib Latif of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in the northern German city of Kiel. Latif, one of Germany's best-known climatologists, says that the temperature curve has reached a plateau. "There can be no argument about that," he says. "We have to face that fact."<br /><br />...."It cannot be denied that this is one of the hottest issues in the scientific community," says Jochem Marotzke, director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg. "We don't really know why this stagnation is taking place at this point......."<br /><br />......."Just a few weeks ago, Britain's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research added more fuel to the fire with its latest calculations of global average temperatures. According to the Hadley figures, the world grew warmer by 0.07 degrees Celsius from 1999 to 2008 and not by the 0.2 degrees Celsius assumed by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And, say the British experts, when their figure is adjusted for two naturally occurring climate phenomena, El Niño and La Niña, the resulting temperature trend is reduced to 0.0 degrees Celsius -- in other words, a standstill."<br /><br />http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,662092,00.html</div>

                              <div class="comment">#88 Jacqueline Hyde<br /><br />said, "The Antarctic is different and indeed it is now known that the overall quantity of ice has not actually diminished but it has moved so that, while there has been a substantial reduction at the Antarctic Peninsula and the Weddell Sea, this has been countered by greater accummulations on the other side of the continent."<br /><br />No. Recent evidence (from gravity monitoring satellites) shows that that is no longer occurring and that East Antarctica has also been losing mass since at least 2006. The net loss from Antarctica as a whole is put at 190 (+ or -77) billion tons per year (1 billion ton ice = approx. 1 cubic kilometre). The loss from East Antarctica alone is 57 bt/year.<br /><br />As for the destruction of forests, which is indeed a problem of the greatest concern, the need to tackle global warming has provided a huge boost to efforts to save forests, the destruction of which contribute up to about 20% of global CO2 emissions.</div>

In light of this, perhaps they can explain this statement by Professor Mike Hulme:<br /><br />"[Upcoming UN climate conference in Copenhagen] “is about raw politics, not about the politics of science. [...] It is possible that climate science has become too partisan, too centralized. The tribalism that some of the leaked emails display is something more usually associated with social organization within primitive cultures; it is not attractive when we find it at work inside science. It is also possible that the institutional innovation that has been the I.P.C.C. has run its course. Yes, there will be an AR5 but for what purpose? The I.P.C.C. itself, through its structural tendency to politicize climate change science, has perhaps helped to foster a more authoritarian and exclusive form of knowledge production – just at a time when a globalizing and wired cosmopolitan culture is demanding of science something much more open and inclusive."<br /><br />http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/11/27/uea-climate-scientist-possible-that-i-p-c-c-has-run-its-course/<br /></div>

Climategate, however, has just about put the kibosh on the Global Warming nonsense. The rogue scientists at the CRU were not just a bunch of undergraduates faking their mid-tern project. Their “results” formed the basis of the UN’s IPCC conclusions and for many years they played a hugely influential role in driving the worldwide alarm over global warming. Along with the Met’s Hadley Centre they selected who would be the IPCC’s “scientific” contributors. Their global temperature “record” is the most important of the four sets of temperature data on which the IPCC and governments rely. Thus all the nonsense spouted by the likes of Lord Stern that the world will warm to catastrophic levels unless trillions of dollars are spent is based on a tissue of lies. </div>

All four series provide similar results. I've already posted the annual figures for the two satellite series. HADCRUT3 is currently only showing values for the early part of this year so cannot presently be used to show very recent changes. NASA GISS shows the monthly figures and, in addition, three monthly averages, which is useful when considering recent changes. If anyone wishes to go to the trouble of computing the three monthly figures for themselves from the other series, then the data is there for them to do so.<br /><br />As far as being "trivial", I have already stated (#52), "such short time periods tell us nothing about anthropogenic global warming one way or another."<br /><br />What is significant about such data is that is accumulating at the same time that countless AGW deniers are constantly claiming that "The earth is presently cooling". This is yet another illustration of how AGW deniers believe what they want to believe rather than what the evidence shows them is happening: therein lies its significance.</div>

Don't you think that this is a little odd?  The technology for collecting definitive data for historic temperatures - spanning several millennia - has been around for a long time, as has the ability to process the data into accurate models.  <br /><br />However, I don't think anyone with half a brain would deny that, over the past century or so, global temperatures have been rising or that, in the last twenty-odd years, there has been an overall acceleration in the rise.  <br /><br />The first difficulty lies with determining how much is the result of human activity and how much is due to the natural cycles of the planet.  The second difficulty lies with determining which (if any) of the human activities that may be contributing to global warming can be curtailed to achieve the greatest reduction in the warming process.  <br /><br />CO2 emissions is only today's favourite target.  A few years ago, it was the clearing of the rain forests (and recycled paper suddenly became necessary - even though no tropical woods have ever been used in paper-making!);  before that it was aerosol sprays and refrigerants (since proved to be no more than commercially inspired scaremongering by DuPont).<br /><br />I am becoming more and more convinced that the real culprit is marine pollution.  About 70% of the earth's surface is ocean so it simply cannot be ignored.  For the CO2 worshippers, there is a vast "sea" of algae in the Pacific which, a few years ago, was consuming nearly twice as much CO2 as all the land-based plants in the world.  This algae soup is being poisoned by marine pollution and subtle ph changes - one report claims that it has reduced in size by over 10% in the last two years.  Even ignoring the CO2 dimension, the oceans should become an increasingly important food resource so protecting them and their life systems is a far more important challenge than subjuga</div>

The CO2 emissions of decaying vegetation in a natural forest roughly balances out the CO2 intake of the plant life.  Indeed the clearing of tropical rain forest probably reduces overall CO2 emissions because of the consequent destruction of all those CO2-emitting insects that can only live in rain forests!  However, as Unimpressed One says, the biodiversity found in rain forests is a vital part of the engine of life on the planet.<br /><br /><br /></div>

Rather than a full Gaussian analysis a 21 point binomial smoothing filter was applied. Posts from obvious fanatics(anyone not from my club) were discarded. Posts after release (17th Nov) of the cru e-mails and data were considered biased and were discarded. The science is now settled, AGW sceptics are a minute minority which can be ignored.

They issue a statement last week announcing that there was a 50% that this winter would be milder than last winter!! Of course, the corollary of this is that there is a 50% chance that this winter will be colder than last winter.

A CRU person is on the<br />editorial board, but papers<br /> get dealt with by the editor assigned by Hans von Storch.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Phil<br /><br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Dear all,<br />Tim Osborn has just come across this. Best to ignore<br />probably, so don't let it spoil your<br /> day. I've not looked at it yet. It results from this journal<br />having a number of editors. The<br /> responsible one for this is a well-known skeptic in NZ. He has let a few papers through by<br /> Michaels and Gray in the past. I've had words with Hans von Storch about this, but got nowhere.<br /> Another thing to discuss in Nice !<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Phil<br /><br /></div>

                              <div class="comment">And from the article about Gordon Brown and the £10 billion scheme, a comment from 'Tweedmouth' in Coldstream : <br /><br />The truth about the Medieval Warm Period is that it was preceeded by many other warm periods - of which the evidence lies all around you. In Northumberland, East Lothian and Perthshire we have dozens of Bronze Age and Iron Age Hillforts at 1000 - 1500ft above sea level - and huge areas of lynchets - hillside terraces where barley was grown at heights up to 1500ft. Youi and I could not survive the winters at these heights today (not in a roundhouse anyway) and we certainly cannot grow crops at these altitudes. Skara Brae was inhabited 4-5000 years ago and today it is in a very cold climate - you would have a very hard winter living on the Orkney coast in a stone house today - without oil or gas or modern stoves. But all the middens at Skara Brae are filled with the shells and bones of Mediterranean fish, mussels and oysters - of species which cannot live this far North anymore. Conclusion - 4-5,000 years ago Scotland and Orkney were much, much warmer than today. It had a Mediterranean climate like Italy or the South of France and the land was so productive they had big surpluses of food - which allowed them time to build great stone circles and monuments - as they did at Stonehenge and Avebury. Much later the climate became colder - then it warmed again in the Roman period and again in the Medieval period when all the great cathedrals were built circa 1100 - 1400 AD. These were times of warmth, abundant crops and plentiful game/ animals. After 1580 we had the Little Ice Age when we had a century of bitterly cold winters, terrible summers, failed crops and famine.<br />We are getting warmer - a little bit warmer - because we are still recovering from the Little Ice Age in the 17th C. None of this is abnormal. It is 'climate change' - a meaningless tautology, like 'wet water', 'hot fire', 'moving wind'. </div>

                              <div class="comment">I have made these points about Skara Brae before.  The EVIDENCE is that warmer temperatures are periods of plenty.<br /><br />I have also posted, several times, that I firmly believe that the Earth is going into a period of significantly cooler temperatures, probably sooner rather than later.  A solar grand minimum combined with a period of predominantly la Ninas to my mind is more likely to lead to cooling - especially when we see that CO2 output has been going on and temepratures have been falling for at least 10 years.  </div>

                              <div class="comment">From the IceCap blog of Joe D'Aleo, a leading climatologist:<br /><br />Courtillot and Jean-Louis Le Mouel, a French geo-magneticist, and three Russian colleagues first came into climate research as outsiders four years ago. The Earth’s magnetic field responds to changes in solar output, so geomagnetic measurements are good indicators of solar activity. They thought it would be interesting to compare solar activity with climatic temperature measurements. <br /><br />Their first step was to assemble a database of temperature measurements and plot temperature charts. To do that, they needed raw temperature measurements that had not been averaged or adjusted in any way. Courtillot asked Phil Jones, the scientist who runs the CRU database, for his raw data, telling him (according to one of the ‘Climategate’ emails that surfaced following the recent hacking of CRU’s computer systems) “there may be some quite important information in the daily values which is likely lost on monthly averaging.” Jones refused Courtillot’s request for data, saying that CRU had “signed agreements with national meteorological services saying they would not pass the raw data onto third parties.” (Interestingly, in another of the CRU emails, Jones said something very different: “I took a decision not to release our [meteorological] station data, mainly because of McIntyre,” referring to Canadian Steve McIntyre, who helped uncover the flaws in the hockey stick graph.)<br /><br />Courtillot and his colleagues were forced to turn to other sources of temperature measurements. They found 44 European weather stations that had long series of daily minimum temperatures that covered most of the 20th century, with few or no gaps. They removed annual seasonal trends for each series with a three-year running average of daily minimum temperatures. Finally they averaged all the European series for each day of the 20th century.</div>

                              <div class="comment">continued :<br /><br />CRU, in contrast, calculates average temperatures by month - rather than daily - over individual grid boxes on the Earth’s surface that are 5 degrees of latitude by 5 degrees of longitude, from 1850 to the present. First it makes hundreds of adjustments to the raw data, which sometimes require educated guesses, to try to correct for such things as changes in the type and location of thermometers. It also combines air temperatures and water temperatures from the sea. It uses fancy statistical techniques to fill in gaps of missing data in grid boxes with few or no temperature measurements. CRU then adjusts the averages to show changes in temperature since 1961-1990. <br /><br />CRU calls the 1961-1990 the “normal” period and the average temperature of this period it calls the “normal.” It subtracts the normal from each monthly average and calls these the monthly “anomalies.” A positive anomaly means a temperature was warmer than CRU’s normal period. Finally CRU averages the grid box anomalies over regions such as Europe or over the entire surface of the globe for each month to get the European or global monthly average anomaly. You see the result in the IPCC graph nearby, which shows rising temperatures.<br /><br />The decision to consider the 1961-1990 period as ‘normal’ was CRUs. Had CRU chosen a different period under consideration, the IPCC graph would have shown less warming, as discussed in one of the Climategate emails, from David Parker of the UK meteorological office. In it, Parker advised Jones not to select a different period, saying “anomalies will seem less positive than before if we change to newer normals, so the impression of global warming will be muted.” That’s hardly a compelling scientific justification!</div>

                              <div class="comment">continued <br /><br />It is well known to statisticians that in any but the simplest data sets, there are many possible ways to calculate an indicator using averages. Paradoxically, and counter-intuitively, they often contradict each other. As a simple example of how the same data can be teased to produce divergent results, consider the batting averages of David Justice and Derek Jeter. For each of three years in 1995-97, Justice had a higher batting average than Jeter did. Yet, overall, Jeter had the highest batting average.<br /><br />In addition to calculating temperature averages for Europe, Courtillot and his colleagues calculated temperature averages for the United States. Once again, their method yielded more refined averages that were not a close match with the coarser CRU temperature averages. The warmest period was in 1930, slightly above the temperatures at the end of the 20th century. This was followed by 30 years of cooling, then another 30 years of warming.<br /><br />Courtillot’s calculations show the importance of making climate data freely available to all scientists to calculate global average temperature according to the best science. Phil Jones, in response to the email hacking, said that CRU’s global temperature series show the same results as “completely independent groups of scientists.” Yet CRU would not share its data with independent scientists such as Courtillot and McIntyre, and Courtillot’s series are clearly different.<br /></div>

                              <div class="comment">#168 Prester John<br /><br />I refer to the ridiculous commentary by Wilson Flood that you uncritically quoted (see http://carbon-sense.com/2009/10/01/british-record/ ). That article was based on the fact that SUMMER (June/July/August) temperatures for Central England during the 18th century were slightly higher than for the 20th century: that is true.<br /><br />What is NOT true, and what is ridiculous, are the conclusions Flood drew from that single piece of information.<br /><br />1. Central England is not the UK, therefore it is not correct to make any statement concerning the UK based on this data, as Flood does.<br /><br />2. Central England is not the whole Earth, so it is not correct to make any statement about GLOBAL warming based on this data, as Flood does.<br /><br />3. Summer is not the whole year, and it is NOT the case that the average ANNUAL temperature in the Central England Temperature series during the 18th century was warmer than the 20th century, because the other three seasons were cooler in the 18th century than in the 20th century.<br /><br />4. Whilst Central England summer temperatures during the 18th century were slightly higher than for the 20th century, this was NOT the case for any other similar period in the 351 year record or for any other season.<br /><br />The Central England data covers three centuries before the twentieth: the 18th and the 19th as well as part of the 17th. For each of those it covers four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter. ONE of those periods, summer in the 18th century, was warmer than summer in the 20th century. All of the eleven other periods were cooler than the corresponding season in the 20th century.<br /><br />So, Wilson Flood cherry picks just that one period, and ignores the rest.<br /><br />For those who are simply interested in seeing the graph of average annual temperature (since 1772) in the Central England data record by the MET Office, see:<br /><br />http://hadobs.metoffice.com/hadcet/graphs/HadCET_graph_ylybars_uptodate.gif<br /><br />The increase in the Central England an</div>

                              <div class="comment">Thanks for that Slioch.  And, although we disagree, thank you for your stalwart defence of your case over the day.<br /><br />As to the graph, here is my interpretation of the "smoothed" red line time-series.<br /><br />1750-1930: cooling p.a. fluctuating between 0 and -1 deg. C.<br />1931-1985: even-stevens, fluctuating between -0,3 deg C.and +0.3 deg. C.<br />1986-1999:  relatively impressive warming variation up to +0.9 deg C<br />2000-?      :   downturn from maximum turning point<br /><br />How on earth do you think this rubbish supports the AGW conjecture?  Are you really bettin everything on a 14 /15 year spurt in a data record of 250 years?<br />Wilson Flood's argument about summer temperature disparities 2+ centuries apart is more impressive.  Your 11 out of 12 argument is jejeune.  Some of the variations are so minscule as to be statistically insignificant.<br /><br />I suggest you go away and find yourself either a religion or another ideology if you MUST believe strongly in something.  Just now, you are holding a busted flush and I tajke you as seriously as The Moonies or the Mormons.</div>

                              <div class="comment">#189 Cynicus Unbound<br /><br />Well, thank you at least for your first sentence.<br /><br />As for, "How on earth do you think this rubbish supports the AGW conjecture?"<br /><br />I'm not sure what you mean by 'rubbish'. The Central England Temperature series is not rubbish - it is the result of painstaking recordings by countless individuals over more than 360 years: you should not disparage and insult those efforts.<br /><br />As for whether it 'supports the AGW' hypothesis, did you not read my statement, "Central England is not the whole Earth, so it is not correct to make any statement about GLOBAL warming based on this data, as Flood does."<br /><br />If you are interested in global warming then you should consult graphs of average global temperatures since local or regional changes will diverge to a greater or lesser extent from the global mean.<br /><br />Your first error is to support Flood's absurd attempt attempt to find global significance from the CET series.<br /><br />Your second error is to infer that I find global significance from the CET series when I explicitly stated that that would be 'not correct'.<br /><br />Thank you for advice about religion, but you must excuse me if I decline to take it. I prefer science and rationality. The comments in this thread bear abundant witness to the dangers to humanity that rapidly follow when reason and science are discarded in favour of the irrationality of the mob.</div>

                              <div class="comment">Now you might wonder how some of my posts were deleted as unsuitable.  Can it be that Slioch is touchy about his name being in a post - despite it appearing widely on the internet. Is that he is touchy about references to his home area - despite my only making a general allusion to Strathspey ?  Is he touchy about the content and implications of the leaked emails which I have read fully ?  Is he sensitive to the comments about the REM code in the computer programme which is clearly unsuitable for purpose.<br /><br />I note that he picks on one small set of data quoting statistics calculated from the longest unbroken statistics and which are merely illustrative of a possible climate tendency.  However, he does not tackle any of the major points raised by me and others.      </div>

These people refuse to use electricity,therefore no radio or television; they use horses to plow fields and pull their family carriages. This is the level Gore and company want to drag you down to while he lives in his twenty room, eight bathroom mansion located in a VERY exclusive area of Nashville,Tennessee using 191,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year.... now compare that to 15,600 kilowatts for the typical Nashville home.<br />Another point to consider, look at the crooked "science" in East Anglia, England, where they destroyed their ORIGINAL notes on 'global warming' due to it taking up too much room.<br /><br /><br /> </div>

Oh, and damage the worlds economy making sure we have more poor people to replace them with no means to feed anyone.<br /><br />Oh, that's their plan?  Sorry, didn't realize the "make everyone poor, then kill the poor" plan was already taken.<br /><br />Sorry to all the millions of poor or those who are borderline and will lose their employment under this plan.  You will now suffer, and freeze or starve to death; but we had to kill you to save the world.<br /><br />You know, unless the science is wrong.  But hey, we're only planning to kill hundreds of millions of people on a hunch; lets do it.<br /><br />I've never seen the caring compassionate liberals so ready to kill off hundreds of millions of poor people.

Dammit, you must be a martyr.</div>

I stand by my comments on poor US technology (except weapons) and see the moderators have rightly seen fit to remove Brad's blatant advertising in Post 200.<br /><br />However, let's get back to the point of the article.....I see that the head of CRU will stand down whilst an independant investigation of his work and practices is undertaken.  It's not before time!</div>
