<p>
Originally built by Ralph Sanchez
(now a partner in the Panoz-Sanchez Group,
who promote IMSA events in the US),
the track opened on November 3rd, 1995.
The original configuration was a cut down version
of <a href="/Tracks/IN/IMS.html">IMS</a>, with
somewhat squarish, slightly banked corners.
After the 1996 season, the corners were reconfigured in a
more conventional manner in response to safety concerns.
The track is currently owned by International Speedways Corporation.
</p>
<p>
The track has variously been refered to as
Miami-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex,
Metro-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex
and
Homestead Motorsports Complex.

<p>
Overall.  Homestead is located south of Miami, Florida and is similar
to other NASCAR tracks which have an added road course in the infield.
Homestead's primary surface however is glass smooth and the infield is
very well cared for.  Tires and brakes hold up very well here and it's
an easy course to learn.  Depending on which course you drive and what
time of year you go, will determine how hard it is on the driver.  If
you get to use the Grand Am course (using NASCAR curves 3 and 4), it
takes a lot of guts to go through those fast and it does strain neck
muscles more than usual because you're driving counterclockwise, which
is different from most road courses.  If you use the cut through
(which bypasses the banking), then it's a fairly boring course with
some interesting/challenging braking zones.  The apex curbs are high,
but the entry and exit curbing is low and rippled and give the driver
plenty of warning without upsetting the attitude of the car (or
driver).  There are plenty of walls, both on the infield and of course
the NASCAR portion of the track, but the most critical areas have
gravel traps in front of tire barriers.  I felt safe driving there.
The garages and overall facilities are what you'd expect from a new,
premier NASCAR circuit - immaculate.  There is plenty of both paved
and grass paddock space depending on your preference.  There are many
hotels and restaurants in the local area, but are pricey!  If you go
during the late spring, summer or early fall months, I highly
recommend using a driver cooling system!!!!
</p>
<p>
All shift points and approximate speeds are using a fully T1 prepared
2001 Z06 with stock transmission and gearing.
</p>
<p>
<b>Important Note:</b> If you are using the NASCAR banking, it's imperative
you adjust your tire pressures (and driving) accordingly.  This track
has predominately left hand corners so you will need more negative
camber on the right and higher pressures too.  Watch the tires closely
for blistering!!!  I increased my right side tires +2 while dropping
the left side -1 (from my normal pressures).  I also increased the
negative camber on the right side by .5 and if the time is available,
you could decrease the negative camber on the left!  Do at least 1
good warm up lap before trying to go through the high banking at full
speed.  The speed and banking puts incredible force on the tires and
it's vital to get them up to temperature before making a banzai
run.  Again,
watch your tires carefully.
</p>
<p>
For practice sessions, get to the pit lane by going thru several open
areas in between the primary garages.  Races start from the false
grid, located in a small area at the far end of the garages where pit
lane ends.  The false grid then enters the track at Pit Out.
</p>
<p>
Leaving the pits, you must check your mirrors for cars flying thru
turn #1 and under heavy braking.  Stay to the left and hug the inside
of the left hand turn #2 until you're sure there's no traffic.
</p>
<p>
Once you're on the main racing line, move to the right and brake hard
for yet another left hand curve.  I am in 3d gear here.  Late apex
this one because you don't want to drift too far out on the exit.
This corner is slick and understeer is predominant upon entry.  You'll
go slightly down hill and approach turn #4.  Brake and turn hard to
set the front end and rotate the car back up the hill.  Get on the
power as soon as possible because this is the start of a long straight
away.  Avoid undue rear tire spin by unwinding the wheel as you apply
the power to the exit of #4 (which is the start of turn #5).  5 is
just a left hand kink and most drivers will have their left side tires
along the low rippled curbing.  It does not affect the suspension.
Keep the power down and unwind the wheel exiting 5 to avoid scrubbing
any speed.  Shift to 4th gear and slowly work your way to the left
side of the track.
</p>
<p>
Turn #6 is a sharp right hand corner with high apex curbing.  There
are braking markers on the left side of the track (on the fence) to
give you some reference points.  Brake hard and heel-toe 4-3 shift.
Use all of the track.  Trail brake the entry and apply the power to
the exit which has more of the low and unobtrusive curbing.  You'll
need to ride along the curbing to make the entry to #7 easier.
</p>
<p>
7 is a flat-out right-hand corner with high apex curbing.  Keep the
power down.  If your car is well set up and you have good tires, you
should be able to keep your foot down all the way through the corner.
Slight oversteer is evident toward the exit and is a real blast if you
get it right!  The exit curbing is nice, low and rippled to give you
excellent feedback of remaining track space.  Shift to 4th upon
exiting 7 and slowly move back to the right.  Turns 6 and 7 are the
key to having a good infield segment because of the long straight that
follows down to #8.
</p>
<p>
Approaching turn 8, there are braking markers on the right side fence.
You'll be well over 100 mph here and I could wait until nearly the 200
marker before braking.  Heel-toe 4-3 downshift and really stand the
car on its nose.  8 is a very tight, left hand, hair-pin corner
leading to the NASCAR portion and the most important corner on the
track.  It's a key to having a fast lap.  If you have good torque, you
can go thru the corner in 3d.  If not, or if you get held up by
traffic, you can downshift to 2d.  It's easy to loop the car though if
you drop that far down.  3d gear seems to be best for overall
consistent lap times and tire conservation.  [The 2006 SCCA National
Race that I have on video is a perfect example of this.  Late in the
race, as I am gaining on Phil Croyle in his yellow #6 Corvette, you
can distinctly hear him downshift to 2d gear trying to get a better
run out of the corner.  As he applies the throttle, he gets power-on
oversteer and loops the car right in front of me.  I select 3d gear on
entry and zag to the left at the exit to avoid him nearly backing into
me.  2d gear can work, but you must be very, very gentle on the
throttle!]  Use all the low curbing at the exit of 8 to avoid wheel
spin and to get the best possible exit.

Turn 9 is just a left hand kink and is basically the back straight on
the NASCAR track.  Shift 3-4 and keep the hammer down to the entry of
NASCAR #3.
</p>
<p>
Circle track drivers are experts in making their car turn left.  If
you can set yours up perfectly, there is quite a bit of time to be had
for #3 and #4.  There's also multiple lines thru this high bank, so
it's important to experiment and find the quickest way.  The lowest
(quickest) lap time could be earned by going either high or low.  I
like to enter NASCAR 3 high, and on the power.  I keep the throttle
down until I see God, and then lift a bit to control either the over
or understeer through there.  Normally you just need a quick 'breathe'
of the gas and then you can plant your foot again.  It's important
that you don't coast through here or make any dramatic moves.  The
G-forces are around 1.5 on most cars/drivers and consistent, smooth
power is key.  I slowly drop the car down the banking and am on the
low/inside line at mid corner.  Keep the power down and unwind that
wheel to help the car maintain the speed and transition easier.  Track
out all the way to the wall and avoid tire scrubbing.  I exit this
corner in 4th gear and over 6K rpms.  I stay in 4th all the way down
the front straight and end up around 7K.  You can shift to 5th if you
choose or just stay in 4th.  I didn't notice any difference in lap
times between the two.  Shifting to 5th is easier on the engine, but
adds 2 additional (and somewhat un-needed) shifts and possible places
to make a mistake.
</p>
<p>
You'll cross start/finish and still be accelerating.  You want to stay
a few feet off the right side wall and SMOOTHLY apply the brakes to
set up for turn 1.  4th gear at 7K rpms is around 150-155 mph in my
car so it's vital to apply the brakes smoothly here.  If you stab the
brakes, that could send the car off to the left or into the wall.  If
you miss your mark, don't brake enough, or just don't feel you can
make it through Turn 1, don't force the issue.  Keep going straight
(on the main NASCAR circuit), punt a few cones and continue on through
NASCAR turn 1 and 2 until you link up with the rest of the racing
circuit (turns 8 and 9) on the other side of the track.  It's better
to do this than to push a bad situation and bend your car and/or get
hurt!
</p>
<p>
Assuming you do brake well and slow the car appropriately, stay in 4th
gear and turn left for the entry into Turn #1.  It's a reasonably
smooth transition into the actual road course part and there's rippled
curbing on the left, inside.  I like to put my left tires on that
curbing, but not much over it.  If you get it right, as soon as you
turn in, you can be back to full throttle thru the corner.  This
again, helps settle the car and plant the suspension.  Once thru,
unwind the wheel to the exit and prepare for a 'dicey' braking zone.
</p>
<p>
Once thru #1, you must get the car straight immediately and stand the
car on it's nose.  It's a SHORT, downhill, braking zone and slightly
bumpy�and you're doing well over 100 mph to boot.  Brake harder than
you think necessary and make sure the car is in a straight line.
Smoothly heel-toe downshift 4-3.  You should try to aim for the end of
the curbing on the right side of the track.  That is the end of the
braking zone and turn-in point for #2.
</p>

Turn #2 is an off camber left-hand turn that looks very simple, but
it's very easy to miss the apex.  It's slick upon entry and the tires
just don't seem to bite well, especially later in the race.  After
slowing the car from #1, trail brake the entry to #2 and then get back
on a smooth throttle.  Nail that apex.  Unwind the wheel gradually and
apply the power all the way to the low, rippled curbing on the
outside.
</p>
<p>
Set up on the right side of the track and take a late apex through
turn #3 and you should now be up to 'full song.' As I said before,
understeer is predominant here.  If possible, try to get back to the
left side to set up for turn 4 and the upcoming long infield straight.
</p>
<p>
If possible, you can be fairly aggressive on set up here.  Stiff
springs, sway bars and shocks would certainly work because the track
is very smooth and the banking is high and very, very fast.  A neutral
set up would probably work the best because of the myriad of corners
(oversteer and understeer).  Toward the end of the race, you may end
up a bit loose in some, but still pushing in others.  The banking
(NASCAR 3 and 4) and turn 1 separates the contenders from the
pretenders.
</p>
<p>
If you're unfortunately not able to run the NASCAR 3-4 banking, then
you'll exit turn 9 and still shift 3-4.  Stay a foot or so off the
outside wall and medium brake for the left-hand entry at turn #10.
This next series of turns is essentially just a large chicane that
by-passes the fast banking.  Once you turn in for 10, it's very
similar to #1, so get back on full throttle and unwind the wheel to
the right side of the track in preparation for, you guessed it,
another left-hand turn.  You should still be in 4th gear.
</p>
<p>
Turn #11 is fast and I like dropping to 3d gear.  Smoothly heel-toe
4-3 and apply big power thru this fast corner�unwind that wheel to the
exit curbing.  Once through, get back to the left quickly for the next
really tight 'S' turn.
</p>
<p>
#12 and #13 are short, slick and tight, but vitally important because
13 leads to the front straight and big speed.  Late apex both these
turns.  Sacrifice exit position in 12 for a perfect entry into 13.
Get on the power as soon as possible and unwind the wheel as far out
as the sanctioning body will allow.  Some clubs put up tires, cones,
or other barriers on the exit of 13 to slow you down even more.  What
are they thinking????
</p>
<p>
Final note.  It's unwise to try to enter the pit lane from the NASCAR
banking (exit of #4).  Because of the deceptive speeds and the fact
that the car is still essentially turning, it's easy to loop the car
trying to get into the pits.  Instead, enter the pit lane road before
entering NASCAR #3.  There may be a speed limit there so watch it.
</p>
<p>
Drive hard and enjoy!!!!
