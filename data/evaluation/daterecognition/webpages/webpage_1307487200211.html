        <li>Where the insured was sued for  fraud, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress in  connection with the sale of property, the insurer had no duty to defend or  indemnify because the policy excluded coverage for intentional acts. Where the  insured was sued for rescission, fraudulent failure to disclose during sale of  property, negligent misrepresentation, and negligent infliction of emotional  distress, the insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify the insured because  the lawsuit did not seek damages constituting &quot;bodily injury&quot; or  &quot;property damage.&quot;</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The court held that an insurer had  no duty to defend or indemnify its insured in a lawsuit seeking damages for  misrepresentation, failure to disclose, and negligence during a sale of  property because the underlying lawsuit did not seek damages that constitute &quot;bodily  injury&quot; or an &quot;accident.&quot;</li>

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Where the insured was sued for  intentional infliction of emotional distress and trespass arising from the  insured's interfering with neighbor's property, the insurer had no duty to  defend or indemnify the insured because the policy excluded coverage for  intentional acts of the insured.</li>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>However, &ldquo;trespass&rdquo; may constitute an accident</strong>:&nbsp; The court held  that an insurer was required to defend its insured in a lawsuit in which an  adjoining owner sought damages for trespass because trespass may constitute an  &quot;accident&quot; as defined by the policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Sale of property</strong>:&nbsp; The court held that an insurer had  no duty to defend or indemnify its insured in a lawsuit seeking damages for  intentional and negligent misrepresentation arising out of a sale of property  because the underlying lawsuit did not seek damages resulting from &quot;bodily  injury&quot; or &quot;property damage.&quot; Further, the negligent  misrepresentation of the insured caused only economic harm for which the  plaintiff in the underlying suit could not recover emotional distress damages.

The insurer is allowed reason&shy;able  time to review its position before undertaking the insured's defense. An  insured claiming his insurer was dilatory in providing defense bears the burden  of showing that the insurer delayed without proper cause. Insured's Homeowners  policy did not cover claims by the insured's former girl&shy;friend that the  insured had entered into an express oral or implied quasi-marital agreement to  share equally in property acquired by the community during the relationship.  The claims made by the former girlfriend relate to breach of contract and do  not constitute &quot;accidental loss.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Insured shooting of bystander in course of shooting  wife, is an &ldquo;accident:&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Policy was ambiguous as to whether the term  &quot;accident&quot; was to be interpreted from the vantage point of the victim  or of the insured.&nbsp; Adopting the former  construction as more favorable to the insured, the court found that insured's  shooting of a bystander in the course of shooting and killing his wife was an  accident.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Shooting wildly, hitting unintended target, not  accident:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; An insured, after an argument with another  man, pursued the man and fired several shots in his direction, hitting  bystanders. The insurer sought a declaration that it was not liable for the  bystanders' injuries because the injuries did not result from an  &quot;accident.&quot; The court held that the injuries were not an ac&shy;cident,  as the insured's firing of his gun was undisputedly volitional. The injuries  would also be excluded under the exclusion for criminal acts in the policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Shotgun firing not an &ldquo;occurrence:&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Firing of a  shotgun into the cab of an occu&shy;pied truck does not qualify as an  &quot;occurrence&quot; under a Homeowners policy that defines &quot;occur&shy;rence&quot;  to mean accident. The insured's intent to injure can be inferred when the  resulting injury is a natural and probable consequence of his act.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Sexual misconduct is not an occurrence</strong>:&nbsp; Sexual  misconduct does not constitute an &quot;occurrence&quot; under the definition  of that term in a which defines &quot;occurrence&quot; as &quot;an accident,  including exposure to conditions, which results, dur&shy;ing the policy period, in  bodily injury or property damage.&quot;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Intercourse is not &ldquo;accidental:&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Insurer  had no duty to defend its insured against personal injury action brought by  mildly retarded adult plaintiff, since sexual intercourse between the insured  and plaintiff did not constitute an &quot;occurrence&quot; because the  insured's conduct was intentional.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Getting drunk is no &ldquo;occurrence:&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp; Policy of  Homeowners insurance did not afford coverage for son of the insured who  assaulted and injured police of&shy;ficers in an hour-long struggle while forcibly  resisting arrest, since son's voluntary intoxication did not vitiate his intent  so that his actions could be considered accidental and thus within policy defi&shy;nition  of an &quot;occurrence.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Anonymous phone calls not an &ldquo;occurrence:&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Series of  anonymous &quot;hang-up&quot; telephone calls made by the insured over 40-day  period were not accidental and thus did not consti&shy;tute an occurrence under  Homeowners policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Shooting in the foot was accidental:</strong>&nbsp; The record  reflected the insured was familiar with guns and had experience in shooting  them and, fur&shy;ther, that he had not intended to shoot the victim with the  shotgun, but only to stop him by firing in front of him as he approached.  Therefore the court affirmed the jury's finding that the insured did not  intentionally shoot the victim in the foot so that there was coverage under the  policy that covered liability for &quot;accidents or occurrences.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Sexual molestation of minor intent not covered  occurrences</strong>:&nbsp; The state Supreme Court would adopt  inferred-intent standard in the case of an insured's sexual molestation of a mi&shy;nor  to impute intent to harm or cause injury, regardless of the insured's actual  subjective intent. Therefore the insured's acts of sexual molestation were not  &quot;occurrences&quot; that resulted in bodily injury, neither expected nor  intended by the insured, covered under the policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Murder in the family</strong>:&nbsp; After extensive review of the  evidence, court held that named insured had murdered the coinsured, and  therefore there was no coverage for the wrongful death action against the named  insured since the liability was excluded from coverage as expected or intended.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Rape is not a covered &ldquo;occurrence:&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Insurance com&shy;pany  had no liability for rape by 13-year-old son of insureds when policy defined  &quot;occurrence&quot; as an &quot;accident ... neither expected nor intended  from the standpoint of the insured.&quot; As a member of the household, 13-year-old  was also an insured, and rape is an intentional act.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>&ldquo;Irresistible impulse&rdquo; rejected in civil law:</strong>&nbsp; Exclusion for  intentional acts excluded coverage for triple homicide.&nbsp; Testimony that the insured was unable to  control his acts when he shot and killed three persons did not establish that  shootings were unintentional.&nbsp;  &quot;Irresistible impulse&quot; defense, rejected in state criminal  law, is also rejected in civil law.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Mistaken trespass is covered &ldquo;occurrence:&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp; Insured's  mistaken but intention&shy;al trespass and conversion by building outside easement  is &quot;accident&quot; under definition of &quot;occur&shy;rence&quot; and  therefore covered by policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>No duty to defend:</strong>&nbsp; Insurer owes no duty to defend  where suit against the insured alleges only intentional conduct or conduct that  is so inherently injurious that it's certain to result in some injury.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Talking bad about the teacher determined to be  accidental &ldquo;occurrence:&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp; Teacher sued the insured for injuries,  including emotional distress damages, arising out of comments made by the  insured concerning the teacher's competency and fitness.&nbsp; The court held that the event causing the  distress will be deemed an accidental occurrence entitling the insured to a  defense when the insured's actions, although intentional, were not intentionally  injurious.&nbsp; The determination must focus  on the subjective intent of the insured, absent exceptional circumstances, such  as sexual assault of children, where an objective approach is warranted and the  intent to injure may be presumed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Not the purpose of insurance protection:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Insurer  submitted sufficient evidence to establish that the injuries sustained by  police officer in assault were either expected or intended by the insured and  that there was therefore no occurrence.&nbsp; <u>Further,  this type of conduct is not conduct for which insurance protection should be  available</u>.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Stabbing is not an occurrence:</strong>&nbsp; Stab&shy;bing an  unarmed victim 40 times and leaving him without calling for help cannot be  deemed an occurrence within the meaning of the policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Digging up neighbors yard not accidental:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Insurer had no  duty to defend ac&shy;tion against the insured for wrongfully entering upon  neighbor's land and erecting earthen berms and potholes. Even if the&nbsp; insured erred as to the extent of his own  property, his acts in changing the landscape of his neighbor's property were  intentional, not accidental, and did not constitute an oc&shy;currence within the  meaning of the policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Assault is an intentional act:</strong>&nbsp; Insurer  provided a de&shy;fense with respect to negligence and assault complaint filed  against its insured. Prior to trial, the negligence claim was dropped and the  jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on her assault cause of  action. Insurer had no obligation to pay the amount of the judgment because  assault is an intentional act and does not constitute an accident under the  policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Foreseeability of harm may infer intent:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Policy that  defined &quot;occurrence&quot; as &quot;accident&quot; and excluded coverage  for bodily injury that was &quot;expected or intend&shy;ed&quot; excluded coverage  for shotgun blast intentionally fired in plaintiff's direction. Focusing on the  deliberate nature of the act, the court found that intent can be inferred on  the basis of the nature of the act and the reasonable foreseeability of harm.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Liquor no excuse:</strong>&nbsp; Intentional acts exclusion pre&shy;cluded  coverage under Homeowners policy for the insured who pleaded guilty to crime of  sexual abuse involving a minor child, despite the insured's claim that he could  not form the requisite intent because of intoxication.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal">1.&nbsp; Which of the following Claim Expenses is NOT  paid by the insurer?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;  Premiums on bonds required in a suit defended by the insurer.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Expenses incurred by the insurer and costs  taxed against an insured in a suit defended by the insurer.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Interest on the entire judgement accruing  after the judgement, subject to limits of liability.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp;  Actual loss of earnings, up to $200 per day.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">2.&nbsp; Fairview  Homeowners Association, an association of property owners, was assessed  for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; failure to comply with a county  ordinance, which is to be paid by members at $10,000 each.&nbsp; Frank, a member of the Association, has a  Homeowners policy.&nbsp; What coverage, if  any, does Frank have under this policy?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;  The Homeowners policy will pay for his share, $10,000, of the  assessment.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; The Homeowners policy will pay for the  assessment after the deductible of $1500 under Frank&rsquo;s policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; The Homeowners policy will not pay for any  share of the assessment.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp; The Homeowners policy will pay the percentage  of the assessment that pertains to the percentage of total floor space in  Frank&rsquo;s home, therefore the ones with larger footage are expected to pay more.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt;">3.&nbsp;  A mother was obviously negligent when she was inebriated in the kitchen  and talking on the phone, when her small slightly retarded son fell from a  ladder leaning against the house, left there by the mother, and breaking his  arm.&nbsp; The insured placed a claim for  Homeowners insurance because of negligence of the mother.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;  The Homeowners policy will pay for any negligent act under the Liability  section.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; The Homeowners policy would usually not pay  because of negligence of the insured, however negligence where another insured  is injured, is covered, so the policy will pay the medical expenses.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Coverage would be provided as since the child  is retarded, it is an exception to the insured exclusion of the policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp; The policy will not pay for any bodily injury  to an insured, and under the policy definitions, the child is considered as an  insured.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt;">4.&nbsp;  Kim Vingh is a resident employee of the insured.&nbsp; Kim goes to town to purchase groceries, walks  against the light, and is injured.&nbsp; What,  if anything, does the Homeowners policy cover?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;  The policy will pay for all medical costs and expenses, and loss of  wages.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;  The policy will pay only for a replacement employee until Kim recovers.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Since the bodily injury occurred (1) off the  insured location, and (2) arose out of the course of employment, the bodily  injury would not be covered.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp;  The Homeowners policy will pay whatever Workers Compensation does not  pay.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt;">5.&nbsp;  An insured is inebriated and does not take action to stop her son from  throwing rocks at passing cars, and a rock hits an elderly lady walking across  the street, causing bodily injury.&nbsp; The  insured is sued for bodily injury to the lady by her son; and negligence for  not taking proper care of the child.&nbsp;  What action would the Homeowners insurance company take, and why?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; The bodily injury would be an intentional act  and not covered.&nbsp; The negligence would be  covered.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; Neither the bodily injury or the negligence  would be covered by the policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; The bodily injury would be covered, but  negligence would not as insured was drunk.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp; Under the severability clause, the policy  will cover both bodily injury and negligence, however the percentage of  responsibility of the insured because of her inebriated state, would be  determined, and that would be reduced from the final settlement figure.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt;">6.&nbsp;  A visitor to a residence is struck in the eye by a baseball thrown by  the teenage boy who lives there.&nbsp; The  insured calls the ambulance (private) and pays for the ambulance before they  take the visitor to emergency care.&nbsp;  Further, the insured tells the visitor that he (the insured) is at  fault, &ldquo;totally&rdquo;, and that his insurance will pay for everything, including  time lost from work.&nbsp; The insured&rsquo;s wife  puts a note in the visitor&rsquo;s pocket &ldquo;to make them feel better&rdquo; attesting to the  fact that the visitor&rsquo;s employer will not have to pay him while he is off work  because of the injury.&nbsp; What will the  Homeowners policy cover in this case?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;  The insurer will honor all of the assumptions of liability offered by  the insured.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; The insurer can, and probably will, refuse to  pay any of these obligations, as it is in direct violation of the policy to  assume any obligations or make payments under any circumstances.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; The insured is allowed to pay for &ldquo;first aid&rdquo;  for the victim, and if the private ambulance service was necessarily paid  before they took the visitor to the emergency room, the insurer would in all  likelihood, reimburse the insured for the ambulance only.&nbsp; Other promises and obligations would not be  covered.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp;  The insurer would cover only the loss of income under the Homeowners policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter" style="margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt;">7.&nbsp;  The plaintiff is suing the homeowner for liability which the plaintiff&rsquo;s  attorney is confident the insurer will pay.&nbsp;  In order to make sure that there is enough money to make the lawsuit  worthwhile, the plaintiff&rsquo;s attorney also sues the insurance company in the  same lawsuit.&nbsp; What is this called&nbsp; -&nbsp; and  can the attorney do this?</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; This is a very wise move by the attorney,  known as &ldquo;Deep Pockets&rdquo; and will probably work.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; This is called &ldquo;joining&rdquo; the parties, and is  excluded under the policy, and the courts have allowed this exclusion.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; This is called &ldquo;fishing&rdquo; and the attorney can  do this until the docket date, after which the attorney must show negligence on  the part of the insurer also.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp;  This is called &ldquo;Enjoiner&rdquo; and is allowed by the policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;">8.&nbsp; When a  Homeowners policy and another policy provide coverage for an accident, but both  policies have &ldquo;no liability&rdquo; clauses which state that if there is another  insurance policy covering the claim, then there is no liability under that  policy, what will the courts decide since both are denying coverage?</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp;  The courts will usually rule that neither insurer has any liability.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp; The ruling will usually be that the policy  with the earlier effective date will be liable, according to the other  provisions of the policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Each insurer&rsquo;s liability will be prorated  upon the basis of the combined policy limits in proportion to the limits of  each policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D.&nbsp;  The court will look at both policies, the one offering the most coverage  must provide the coverage.</p>
      <p class="MsoFooter" style="margin-left:13.5pt;text-indent:-13.5pt;">9.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Something that happens or takes place, specifically an accident, event  or continuing condition that results in a personal injury or property damage  that is neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of an insured party&rdquo;  is the definition of</p>
