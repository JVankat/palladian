Then I stuffed in the ramshackle drawers of my brain and it occured to me that there was something in common here with exopolitics....<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>&quot;the earliest period in the history of a civilization is commonly called a heroic age because the values for which men strive and which give meaning to their lives are connected with a life of heroic action on earth.&quot;  -- Nels M. Bailkey</blockquote><br/><br/><br/>While I think everyone would agree that America has passed what most historians would call its heroic age, I suspect that some of what is defining the psyche of the new millenium is an attempt at renewal.  Changes in the internal contact paradigm, and changes in perception of leadership of the country through fulfillment of integrated social potential.... <br/><br/><blockquote>THE THEME I SING<br/><br/>Give me the harp of epic song<br/>Which Homer's finger thrilled along;<br/>But tear away the sanguine string,<br/>For war is not the theme I sing .<br/>Proclaim the laws of festal right,<br/>I'm monarch of the board tonight;<br/>And all around shall brim as high, <br/>And quaff the tide as deep as I.<br/>And when the cluster's mellowing dews<br/>their warm enchanting balm infuse,<br/>our feet shall catch the elastic bound,<br/>And reel us through the dance's round.<br/>Great Bacchus! we shall sing to thee,<br/>In wild but sweet ebriety;<br/>Flashing around such sparks of thought,<br/>As Bacchus could alone have taught.<br/>     Then, give the harp of epic song,<br/>Which Homer's finger thrilled along;<br/>But tear away the sanguine string,<br/>For war is not the theme I sing.<br/><br/>-- Anacreon of Teos, Asia Minor (Early Greek Lyric Poetry)<br/>Trans. Thomas Moore</blockquote><br/><br/>Sometimes I wonder if I use my knowledge of the past legitimately...I have noted that I don't always connect the dots conventionally...so what?  Of the artist, the scientist, the philosopher, & the historian...none of these catagories do I specifically fit...perhaps artist/philosopher would be closest but I know more history than of the other, lol...<br/><br/><blockquote>&quot;The artist....raids his cultural inheritance in order to make something new and personal.  Untroubled by anachronism, he repossesses and reshapes only those ideas and forms, those patterns of belief and behavior that serve his own work, that nourish his own sensibility, values and obsessions.  The past speaks....in the present tense.&quot;  -- Eugene Rice</blockquote><br/><br/>I am not preserving history...no I'm making it live again by giving it new influence in the context of today...so yes Artist/Philosopher would be most appropriate there...hmmm adding additional value to the work of historians.  I like what Eugene Price has had to say on the matter and importance of history preservation and on the liberty of artists to affect change...he melds the best of both worlds to help the future become meaningful and real.<br/><br/><blockquote>&quot;This liberty is our guarantee of innovation, our assurance that the past will continue to be used in the interests of the future....So great is the diversity of mankind and so heterogeneous the possible lessons of the past that we cannot plausibly expect historical precedent to solve our personal or public difficulties in any direct or simple way....it is precisely the wealth of alternatives preserved in our memory of things said and done that enables us to experiment and suggest the possibility and directions of change.  Where there are no alternatives there can be no choice....transmitting knowledge of past problems and solutions performs the absolutely critical function of alerting each successive generation to a maximum number of possibilities.  A clean slate is a wholly unsatisfactory foundation for a better world, and those who wish to free themselves from the past enslave themselves to the present.&quot;  --  Eugene Price</blockquote><br/><br/>At this moment I search the seeming randomness of life, the sweet pickles of history, and the obscure synchronistic thoughts which are too vague to realize upon paper immediately and compare unending all morsels....wisdom, I have found is not linear....my weavings are contorted deliberately lest I miss something of great importance and value.<br/><br/>And more of my readings which I relate to our present philosophy of change; this most of all:<br/><br/><blockquote>&quot;Begin the morning by saying to yourself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful,  arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial.  All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil.  But I who have seen the nature of the good that is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him.  For we are made for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth.  To act against one another then is contrary to nature, and it is acting against on another to be vexed and to turn away....<br/><br/>Of human life the time is a point, and the substance is in a flux, and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole body subject to putrefaction, and the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to divine, and fame a thing devoid of judgment.  And, to say all in a word, everything which belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the soul is a dream and vapor, and life is a warfare and a stranger's sojourn, and after-fame is oblivion.  What then is that which is able to conduct a man?  One thing and only one, philosophy.  But this consists in keeping the demon within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without a purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man's doing or not doing anything....<br/><br/>That which is not good for the swarm, neither is it good for you...<br/><br/>Is any man afraid of change?  Why, what can take place without change?  What then is more pleasing or or more suitable to the universal nature?  And can you take a bath unless the wood undergoes a change?   And can you be nourished, unless the food undergoes a change?   And can anything else that is useful be accomplished without change?  Do you not see then that for yourself also to change is just the same, and equally necessary for the universal nature?....<br/><br/>Retire into yourself.  The rational principle which rules has this nature, that it is content with itself when it does what is just, and so secures tranquillity...<br/><br/>Remember that to change thy opinion and to follow him who corrects your error is as consistent with freedom as it is to persist in your error.  For it is your own, the activity which is exerted according to your own movement and judgment, and indeed according to your own understanding too...<br/><br/>Men exist for the sake of one another.  Teach them then or bear with them....&quot;   -- Marcus Aurelius, <i>To Himself</i></blockquote><br/><br/>Cy<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by philliman on Jan 20, 2009, 4:03pm<br/><br/>Nice blog, Cy.

R. Nyquist<br/>Weekly Column Published: 03.27.2009<br/><br/>Diogenes the cynic was a Greek philosopher of the fourth century B.C. who walked the streets of Athens carrying a lamp in broad daylight. People asked what he was doing. He said, �I am just looking for a human being.� After Plato offered Socrates� definition of humanity as �featherless bipeds,� Diogenes brought a plucked chicken to Plato�s Academy, saying, �Behold! I have brought you a human being.� When captured by pirates and sold into slavery his new master asked what his trade was. �Governing men,� he replied, adding that he wished to belong to someone who needed a master. One morning, when Diogenes was basking in the sun, Alexander the Great came to see him. Wishing to do the philosopher a kindness, Alexander asked if there was any favor he could bestow. �Yes,� replied Diogenes. �Stand out of my sunlight.� <br/><br/>The integrity of Diogenes has much to do with his independence. He was not interested in advancing his career, winning the favor of princes, or making money. He didn�t flatter his teachers or the public. When he spoke, there was no reason to distrust what he said. He had nothing to sell, so he had no motive to flatter or manipulate. In today�s world we have become very comfortable buying and selling things. It is also our habit to say what is pleasing to our superiors. More and more, our culture emphasizes the necessity of having a career, of promoting oneself, of making money and impressing other people. <br/><br/>To be wise, to love wisdom, requires a different emphasis than that of today�s culture. It requires an emphasis on truth and clarity. To be successful today, to advance your career, truth and clarity aren�t always appreciated. Perhaps you have heard that the customer is always right. And everyone with common sense knows that the boss is right � because he is the boss. Despite our egalitarian pretenses, rank is an inescapable reality of human existence. And when rank and privilege are abused, when truth is disregarded, what is the underling to do? Should he, like Socrates, drink the hemlock? Alexander the Great admired the nobility of Diogenes, because Diogenes revered his own clarity and the truth above all mortal masters. The Macedonian said, �If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes.�<br/><br/>The crisis of our time is a crisis of intellectual integrity. We are suffering a deluge, in which common sense is drowned by the career logic of millions of nonentities. They are nonentities because they are careerists, because they have put something trivial above what is non-trivial. Their indifference to truth is seen in their daily compromises, their evasions, their manipulations of each other. They have become accustomed to subtle distortions, euphemisms and rationalizations. �I have to make a living,� says the salesman. �I have to win votes,� says the politician. �I have to raise my ratings,� says the television personality. �I have to keep my job,� says the employee. <br/><br/>Quite naturally, ducking and weaving through reality is sometimes required for survival � or so we think. But survival is easier than we imagine, and the truth is more important than the supposed glory of a chosen career path. To become a collaborator against the truth, to participate in a regime of self-deception, should not have been normalized. We censor ourselves because we don�t want to be unpopular. We don�t want to offend our �superiors.� But the salvation of a country � of any country � usually boils down to the willingness of one respected figure taking an unpopular stand, or one subordinate risking the wrath of his superior. <br/><br/>Consider the significance of Christ on the cross. Read the words of Mathew 16:25: �For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.� This is not a guide to success in the popularly accepted sense. It is something far more important. Ask yourself, honestly: What is the value of a false position? The policy of holding your tongue and deceiving others by omission is not workable. Why should we waste our time ducking and cringing? To hide what we think, and disguise our true thoughts, is to act the part of a slave or underling who serves his master by fooling him.  This is not a position of self respect. It is a position of retreat and compromise. Isn�t it better to speak the truth? <br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Mar 30, 2009, 11:40pm<br/><br/>It was a commentary which I thought well worth repeating....Cy<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Mar 31, 2009, 6:52pm<br/><br/><br/><b><a href="/index.cgi?action=gotopost&board=futuretalk&thread=2628&post=169390">Mar 21, 2009, 11:08am</a>, cyrellys wrote:</b><table bgcolor="000000" class="bordercolor" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr><td width="100%"><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="quote" width="100%"><tr><td width="100%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="quote" size="1"><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6U0-38K5qW8&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6U0-38K5qW8&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br/><br/><br/><br/>Aimee Allen - Myspace Music<br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/aimeeallen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/aimeeallen</a><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Mar 31, 2009, 7:09pm<br/><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WBo8t0B5NhM&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WBo8t0B5NhM&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object><br/><br/><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8N5U_5RLXq0&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8N5U_5RLXq0&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object><br/><br/><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Qnbijp5sQJA&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Qnbijp5sQJA&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Mar 31, 2009, 7:33pm<br/><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kNrqUctZTkU&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kNrqUctZTkU&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object><br/><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gnQFxfyD9gs&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/gnQFxfyD9gs&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object><br/><br/><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/49cndlLMGRc&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/49cndlLMGRc&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object><br/><br/><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/z6xV4d1kRog&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/z6xV4d1kRog&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object><br/><br/>commentary that was posted about the Columbia video above:  This is one of the songs Woody wrote to glamorize the harnessing of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest.

The red dots show the locations of homes in low-lying areas of Delaware County that were expected to flood. <br/><br/><br/>All Things Considered, July 31, 2006 · Two-and-a-half years from now, in early 2009, the Census Bureau plans to send an army of 100,000 temporary workers down every street and dusty, dirt road in America. They will be armed with handheld GPS devices. <br/><br/>Robert LaMacchia, head of the Census Bureau's geography division, says they'll capture the latitude and longitude of the front door of every house, apartment and improvised shelter they find. <br/><br/>&quot;We will actually knock on doors and look for hidden housing units,&quot; he says. &quot;We will find converted garages; from the outside, it may not look like anybody lives there.&quot; <br/><br/>But census workers will add each dwelling, legal or not, to the Census Bureau's Master Address File. <br/><br/>Recent proposed budget cuts have put part of this plan in jeopardy. But if Congress restores the money, the census will end up with the geographic coordinates — accurate to within 10 feet — for about 110 million residences. <br/><br/>But the Census Bureau can't, by law, share that list with anyone, even local governments. LaMacchia says the information has to be treated as confidential. Otherwise, people might lie, and the census wouldn't be accurate. <br/><br/>&quot;People would not tell us about hidden housing units,&quot; LaMacchia says. &quot;People would not respond to the questionnaire if they believed that that information would be turned over to law enforcement or code enforcement and become public information. &quot; <br/><br/>Mapping Might Save Lives<br/><br/>Shoreh Elhami, director of Geographic Information Systems in Delaware County, Ohio, says this sort of information can save lives. <br/><br/>&quot;Having a geographic dataset that is accurate, comprehensive and current is priceless,&quot; Elhami says. <br/><br/>Her passion and devotion have made Delaware County, a fast-growing area just north of Columbus, one of the most meticulously mapped areas of the country. <br/><br/>At her computer, with a few clicks of the mouse, Elhami can pull up a complex, multi-layered picture of Delaware County. Standard commercial software lets her highlight sewer lines, flood plains or real estate tracts. She can pick any address and retrieve pictures of that building from overhead and from the street, along with information about its owner. <br/><br/>The map can answer questions you never expected to ask, she says. Last year, a big storm came through. A reservoir on the Olentangy River, just upstream from the town, was in danger of overflowing, and authorities thought they might have to release water through the dam. <br/><br/>Nobody knew how many people in the town of Delaware might be flooded out of their homes. Elhami rushed to her electronic map. She added a new layer to the picture — an image she'd received from the Army Corps of Engineers showing low-lying areas that would end up under water. <br/><br/>The image showed the outline of the &quot;inundation zone,&quot; and within it, lines and clusters of little red dots. Each of those dots was a house that lay within the potential flood zone. <br/><br/>&quot;The software allows you to do a count of every one of those residences and produce a file of those addresses,&quot; she says. <br/><br/>Elhami delivered that file to emergency managers, and they quickly called the people at each address. Fortunately, the storms subsided, and no flood came. <br/><br/>Every address in the county is in a database, complete with geographic coordinates so it will show up accurately on a map. <br/><br/>Assembling that data is a time-consuming effort. On one recent summer morning, Caleb Gutshall and Sheri Feasel trudged down North Winter Street, in Delaware, checking each address on this commercial strip and making sure that the county's list of occupants was accurate. They also take pictures of any new buildings. One door was unnumbered and locked. Gutshall peered in the window, but learned nothing. &quot;It doesn't look like anybody's in there,&quot; he said. <br/><br/>Now the Census Bureau is planning to undertake much the same kind of effort, on a massive scale, covering the entire country. Elhami says that the Master Address File could be a priceless resource for many counties that don't have the resources to collect that information on their own. <br/><br/>Private Companies Push for Data<br/><br/>Pressure is growing to change the law and make this information available. Demand for geographic data is booming.<br/><br/>Private companies would love to get their hands on the Census Bureau's data. Web sites like Mapquest.com or maps.google. com, usually show addresses within the correct city block, but they will point to the correct house less than half the time. <br/><br/>Don Cooke, an executive from the mapping company TeleAtlas, says the Census Bureau's database would immediately solve that problem, and he'd like to use it. <br/><br/>&quot;The laws basically say the intellectual property that's generated by the government belongs to us citizens, so I'd like to get it,&quot; he says. &quot;Because I don't want to spend the money to go out and compile it!&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Related NPR Stories<br/>March 27, 2000<br/>The US Census  <br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 20, 2009, 5:59am<br/><br/>What was that?

Tier I exercises (formerly known as the Top Officials exercise series or TOPOFF) are conducted annually in accordance with the National Exercise Program (NEP), which serves as the nation's overarching exercise program for planning, organizing, conducting and evaluating national level exercises. The NEP was established to provide the U.S. government, at all levels, exercise opportunities to prepare for catastrophic crises ranging from terrorism to natural disasters.<br/><br/>NLE 09 is a White House directed, Congressionally- mandated exercise that includes the participation of all appropriate federal department and agency senior officials, their deputies, staff and key operational elements. In addition, broad regional participation of state, tribal, local, and private sector is anticipated. This year the United States welcomes the participation of Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom in NLE 09. <br/><br/>EXERCISE FOCUS<br/><br/>NLE 09 will focus on intelligence and information sharing among intelligence and law enforcement communities, and between international, federal, regional, state, tribal, local and private sector participants.<br/><br/>The NLE 09 scenario will begin in the aftermath of a notional terrorist event outside of the United States, and exercise play will center on preventing subsequent efforts by the terrorists to enter the United States and carry out additional attacks. This scenario enables participating senior officials to focus on issues related to preventing terrorist events domestically and protecting U.S. critical infrastructure.<br/><br/>NLE 09 will allow terrorism prevention efforts to proceed to a logical end (successful or not), with no requirement for response or recovery activities. <br/><br/><br/><br/><font color="Yellow">NLE 09 will be an operations-based exercise to include: activities taking place at command posts, emergency operation centers, intelligence centers and potential field locations to include federal headquarters facilities in the Washington D.C. area, and in federal, regional, state, tribal, local and private sector facilities in FEMA Region VI, which includes the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.</font><br/><br/><br/>EXERCISE OBJECTIVES<br/><br/>Through a comprehensive evaluation process, the exercise will assess prevention and protection capabilities both nationally and regionally. Although NLE 09 is still in the planning stages, the exercise is currently designed to validate the following capabilities:<br/><br/>Intelligence/ Information Sharing and Dissemination<br/>Counter-Terrorism Investigation and Law Enforcement<br/>Air, Border and Maritime Security<br/>Critical Infrastructure Protection<br/>Public and Private Sector Alert/Notification and Security Advisories<br/>International Coordination<br/>VALIDATING THE HOMELAND SECURITY SYSTEM<br/><br/>Exercises such as NLE 09 are an important component of national preparedness, helping to build an integrated federal, state, tribal, local and private sector capability to prevent terrorist attacks, and rapidly and effectively respond to, and recover from, any terrorist attack or major disaster that occurs.<br/><br/>The full-scale exercise offers agencies and jurisdictions a way to test their plans and skills in a real-time, realistic environment and to gain the in-depth knowledge that only experience can provide. Participants will exercise prevention and information sharing functions that are critical to preventing terrorist attacks. Lessons learned from the exercise will provide valuable insights to guide future planning for securing the nation against terrorist attacks, disasters, and other emergencies.<br/><br/>For more information about NLE 09, contact the FEMA News Desk: 202-646-4600.<br/><br/>FEMA leads and supports the nation in a risk-based, comprehensive emergency management system of preparedness, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation, to reduce the loss of life and property and protect the nation from all hazards including natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other man-made disasters.<br/><a href="http://www.google." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.</a> com/search? pz=1&ned=us&hl=en&q=NLE+09&btnmeta%3Dsearch% 3Dsearch= Search+the+ Web<br/><br/>============ ========= ========= ======<br/><br/>GOOGLE: Results 1 - 10 of about 421,000 for NLE 09.<br/><br/>============ ========= ========= ========= =====<br/><br/>YOUTUBE: - Carl Klang's Song: &quot;&quot;Seventeen Little Children&quot; <br/><br/>VIDEO: Tapping your cell phone <br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 21, 2009, 5:15am<br/><br/><br/><b><a href="/index.cgi?action=gotopost&board=blogs&thread=4734&post=175265">Apr 21, 2009, 4:57am</a>, cyrellys wrote:</b><table bgcolor="000000" class="bordercolor" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr><td width="100%"><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="quote" width="100%"><tr><td width="100%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="quote" size="1">I wandered in to Quayles website tonight to see if anything interesting going on and ran into this below....I'm still looking for the why as to his posting of this...but I suspect it probably has something to do with FEMA - National Level Exercise 2009 (NLE 09).

Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. 4For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. 6This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. 7Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.<br/>Love, for the Day is Near <br/><br/> 8Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. 9The commandments, &quot;Do not commit adultery,&quot; &quot;Do not murder,&quot; &quot;Do not steal,&quot; &quot;Do not covet,&quot;[a] and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;[b] 10Love does no harm to its neighbor.

The ending is well worth the read.  Cy<br/><br/><br/><br/>From: Eric WhoRU &lt;ewrbn@...&gt;<br/>Subject: [whoru] Rough Draft of Letter to State AG<br/>To: whoru@yahoogroups.com<br/>Date: Tuesday, April 21, 2009, 7:41 PM<br/><br/><br/>To All Group Members and others, please be advised that this is an incomplete rough draft. I am posting it here for comments and input from all who would choose to provide same. After the final version is completed I will post it here for the use of any who choose to do so - this is not to be considered legal advice.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>I'm Eric, WhoRU??<br/><br/>Dear AG - <br/><br/>As I am sure you are aware, the Arkansas State legislature is considering a resolution castigating the Government of the United States for serious encroachment on the Sovereign rights of the Arkansas State (or State of Arkansas, as the case may be; hereinafter &quot;Arkansas&quot;), under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America (hereinafter &quot;United States&quot;). I strenuously support this action on the part of the Arkansas Legislature. <br/><br/>I am writing to you on a similar issue under the aegis of both the Ninth Amendment and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and Article 27 of Section Two of the Arkansas Constitution. <br/><br/>I am a man of about 75 years of age living in the area known as Marion County (or County of Marion, as the case may be; hereinafter &quot;Marion County&quot;), in Arkansas. I have been living here since about the year 2000. <br/><br/>Due to information I was exposed to in 1964 during the Lyndon Johnson - Berry Goldwater Presidential election (I am not a registered voter nor do I identify with either or any political party), I became aware that much of what I had been taught in government schools were lies or at least total misrepresentations of the truth, such as that all persons born on the land area known as the United States are automatically born into United States citizenship and/or state citizenship. I gradually became aware that it is totally impossible for a real live flesh and blood human being to be born into a totally artificially created political entity such as is the United States and as are each and all of the Fifty States comprising the Federation known as The United States of America. <br/>I gradually came to a realization that not only do I not know when nor where I was born, nor who my own parents were, nor whether a &quot;birth certificate&quot; was issued regarding my birth or not but I came to realize that neither does any other man or woman have any ability to have personal knowledge of any of these things. These points are not merely my unsupported personal beliefs, they are irrefutable facts that cannot be reasonably denied. These are facts of which any and every court of law is obligated to take mandatory judicial notice. <br/><br/>As it is clear than no individual person has any ability to have personal knowledge of any of these facts it reasonably follows that no person who has become or been made aware thereof can possibly honestly present a birth certificate to &quot;prove&quot; their date of birth, place of birth nor who the person's natural mother and father were; therefore, it is impossible for such a person to honestly present any such documentation to an agency of any government for the purpose of securing some purported benefit provided by the government. <br/>The Legislature of Arkansas has taken it upon itself to enact statutes requiring all persons to secure a driver license prior to operating a motor vehicle in Arkansas. In its enactments in this regard the said Legislature has determined that applicants for a driver license shall present a birth certificate to the appropriate issuing office before a driver license may be issued. The said Legislature has not provided any alternate means whereby persons otherwise qualified, who are aware that they have no ability to have personal knowledge as to the authenticity of any birth certificate which might pertain to their own birth, to be issued a driver license or Arkansas identification card. <br/><br/>I am such a person. Upon my arrival in Arkansas in the year 2000, I presented myself to the local Arkansas Revenue Office located in Yellville, Marion County, for the purpose of securing a driver license and was duly refused the issuance thereof because I could not present a birth certificate regarding my own birth. <br/><br/>The question repeatedly presenting itself to me over the years has been: &quot;What is the significance of a birth certificate and why does the government make such an issue over the requirement that a person present such a seemingly fallacious document in order to be issued such an innocent appearing document as a driver license?&quot; <br/><br/>The parents enter the &quot;name&quot; of their child on the birth certificate and the birth certificate is then filed and registered with the government by the child's parents - why? <br/><br/>Through my reasoning process I have concluded that what this &quot;name&quot; registration process does is to create an artificial personage the ownership of which is unknowingly and unintentionally assigned to the government by the parents, to be &quot;adopted&quot; later by the child after the child has been subjected to many years of servitude indoctrinating mind control during the child's mandatory attendance in government mind control centers euphemistically known as &quot;public schools&quot;. <br/><br/>As parents do not own their children parents cannot overtly transfer ownership of their children to the government and most parents would most probably balk if the parents were to be made aware of what was being set up upon their filing of the birth certificate with the government, effectively transferring ownership of their child's &quot;name&quot; to the government, so that when the child &quot;voluntarily&quot; and &quot;officially&quot; began using the government's property (the &quot;name&quot;), as an adult, the &quot;ownership&quot; of the person by the government would be fully accomplished without anyone being the wiser. <br/><br/>This scam is known as, &quot;Fraud in the inducement&quot;! <br/>A &quot;name&quot; is the designation assigned to property by the owner thereof; as I do not have an owner I do not have a &quot;name&quot;. Eric Williams is not my &quot;name&quot;, Eric Williams is who I am! <br/><br/>I have often heard the reference to what is known as &quot;positive ID&quot; and that a driver license is considered to constitute the &quot;positive ID&quot; desired by the government. It seems that what the government is actually accomplishing through the requirement of the presentation of a birth certificate in order for a person to be issued a driver license is to surreptitiously lead the applicant into volunteering into a condition of servitude in order for the government to avoid an overt violation of Article 27 of Section Two of the Arkansas Constitution and the Thirteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. I contend that this is done in order for the person to be &quot;legitimately&quot; subjected to taxation and other government control and micro-management of the person's life! If the government's true purpose was merely to establish &quot;positive ID&quot; rather than a condition of servitude, then why does the government not simply require all driver license applicants to submit to full palm finger printing, retina scans or to provide a DNA sample? Why does the government need to establish the birth origin of the applicant in order to merely create &quot;positive ID&quot;?<br/><br/>In regard to my opening reference herein above, to certain constitutional provisions, I contend that what we have here is an intentional failure on the part of the government to recognize or to in any way acknowledge the natural free born political status of all human beings naturally acquired upon their birth, that is, each and every individual human being is born politically free, politically independent and politically Sovereign over their own individual self, totally free of all or any political or other servitude obligation to any and/or every political or other artificial entity created by other humans prior to the birth of such individuals. <br/><br/>How can it reasonably be asserted that persons born before me can have had any properly acquired authority to make politically oriented rules that I am required to obey, when such purported political rules were made years before my birth and in regard to which I had no opportunity what-so-ever to voice my agreement or objection thereto? Based on this reasoning how could any person ever be born into citizenship? <br/><br/>Let me make it clear, I am most certainly not a scofflaw nor an anarchist! Nor am I anti-government! I contend that if we do not create a government of our own choosing some foreign tyrant will invade our land and impose a government upon us which we would not like. However, I further contend that there is no difference in the long run whether the tyranny imposed upon us is of foreign origin or domestic; and on this same point, I contend that the tyranny I am being subjected to here in this county is of no lesser objection than that encountered by the people of the People's Republic of China nor the people of the Democratic People's Republic of [north] Korea. <br/>I contend, that just as the Sovereign authority of the several states is Constitutionally protected by the Tenth Amendment, so is the Sovereign Authority of the People of the United States likewise protected by the Ninth Amendment. That is, the political status &quot;People of the United States&quot; and the political status &quot;citizen of the United States&quot; are NOT in any way the same as proclaimed by Chief Justice Tanny in the Dred Scott case in 1857, I contend that although Dred Scott may very well have been the rule prior to 1866/1868, with the invocation of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments, any application of the Supreme Court's rulings in Dred Scott became moot upon the invocation of these two amendments; that the Fourteenth Amendment very clearly establishes that US citizenship is a condition of total servitude, and that therefore, US citizenship cannot possibly be obtained by the mere birth of a person within the boundaries claimed by the United States or any of the Fifty Several States; and that the Thirteenth Amendment clearly protects the political class known as People of the United States as the term People of the United States is established through the employment of such as a &quot;term of art&quot; in the Preamble to the Federal Constitution. <br/><br/>As the Thirteenth Amendment prohibits involuntary servitude Fourteenth Amendment U.S. citizenship can only be acquired through the voluntary determination of an individual person after such person, born here on this land, reaches the age of reason, generally accepted in this country as being sixteen years of age, and first exercised, &quot;officially&quot; , when the young person presents &quot;his&quot; or &quot;her&quot; birth certificate during an application to be issued a driver license. <br/><br/>I further contend that as such driver license applicants, having been subjected to thirteen years of intense mind control indoctrination in government indoctrination centers euphemistically known as &quot;public schools&quot;, such applicants have never ever been properly informed of the Sovereign political status they were born with, and such applicants are never informed of the fact that they were in fact born totally free and individually Sovereign over their own person, and were never ever told or in any way informed by their indoctrination officers that U.S. citizenship is a voluntary condition of subservience constituting a total surrender of their natural born and naturally acquired individual personal Sovereignty, that such applicants never mentioned purported surrender of their natural born political Sovereign status upon application for a driver license constitutes and is a total fraud perpetrated by the government of Arkansas and every one of the other several states of this Federation, upon the unwitting children improperly commanded to attend such indoctrination centers! Therefore, that it is not possible for any such indoctrinated person to have properly, willingly, intentionally, being fully informed of what they were giving up and surrendering themselves into when they submit themselves to the political jurisdiction of the United States, or to the political dominion of Arkansas. <br/><br/>I contend that it is not reasonably possible for Arkansas to properly use its vast enforcement power to impose its non existing authority over those few of us who have reasoned our way through and out of the mind control we were and are subjected to continually, by the various governments that have done and are doing everything they can to destroy every vestige of true freedom yet remaining in this country. A condition of true freedom has never ever actually existed in the United States or in any political subdivision thereof!! <br/><br/>I contend that Arkansas Constitution Article Two, Section 27, prohibiting involuntary servitude, makes it Constitutionally impossible for any person to be born under the political dominion of Arkansas. Although Arkansas Constitution Article two, Section One provides that all political power is inherent in the People [of Arkansas]. Is it not totally unreasonable for such a Constitutional provision to imbue the People of Arkansas, as a group, with powers none of such people individually possess? <br/><br/>Would anyone suggest that the People of Arkansas have the political power to declare that a cow could fly? So where then is the clear extent of the limit of the inherent political power of the People of Arkansas? Does not Reason dictate that the group comprising the People of Arkansas can not possibly have power in excess of any one single individual member of such group? Would anyone agree that the People of Arkansas have the political power to make lawful the armed robbery of WalMart? So where then is the reasonable limit of the &quot;inherent political power&quot; of the People of Arkansas? <br/><br/>Would someone perhaps argue that causing a cow to fly is not a political issue, such an endeavor would be a physical issue and physical issues are not included in the Constitutional political powers of the People of Arkansas - OK - so when is an issue physical rather than political? Is not the taking of money from someone at gunpoint a physical issue? Can it reasonably be argued that taxation is not the taking of money at gunpoint? <br/><br/>As I have no natural individual authority to lay a tax on you and as you have no natural individual authority to lay a tax on me and as no other single individual has any natural authority to lay a tax on any other individual person, then how can the People of the government of Arkansas possibly have any proper authority to lay a tax on anyone and everyone? Does a wrong and criminal means ever become justified merely because of the perceived good result derived therefrom? Who gets to decide this for me? Is this not clearly an issue protected under the prohibition of involuntary servitude as set forth in Arkansas Constitution Article 2, Section 27? And, of course, the same prohibition is set forth in the Thirteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution! And, in the unspecified rights referenced in the Ninth Amendment to the federal Constitution, which very specifically pertains to the People of the United States, not to citizens of the United States, which is also clearly also the case in the First, Second, Fourth, Ninth and tenth amendments, where the designation of protected class is specifically the People of the United States, wherein there is not even one single reference to any such protections applying to citizens of the United States. <br/><br/>Please write something back to convince me that I am wrong on even one point that I have addressed! <br/><br/>Is it not clear that these constitutional prohibitions are there to prohibit and restrain the relevant government from declaring any person to be citizens of the United States or to be a citizen of Arkansas? Is it not clear that the only persons that may be required to submit themselves to the authority of the political entity, Arkansas, are those persons who have freely knowingly volunteered themselves into the political statue of citizen of the United States and/or citizen of Arkansas? How and where did I ever volunteer into such status? Is not the burden of proof clearly upon the artificial political entity, Arkansas? When was I ever properly informed by the government while I was being required to attend government indoctrination facilities as a small child, that I was born free and Sovereign and that I had the natural born right to choose for myself whether or not I would volunteer to participate in the artificial political entity, Arkansas or the artificial political entity United States? <br/><br/>Additionally, I contend that it is a fair and reasonable interpretation of these constitutional involuntary servitude prohibitions, that the Executive Authority of Arkansas (and of the United States), are obligated to protect me and similarly situated persons, from the various enforcement officers of Arkansas and all of the political subdivisions of Arkansas. That is, I contend that the wording of these provisions clearly acknowledge that there may well be persons born politically free and Sovereign here on this land, who will NOT choose to voluntarily submit themselves to the political dominion of any artificial political entity, and who are therefore, not subject to any of the rules, regulations or statutes promulgated by any of the various legislatures of the relevant artificial political entities. <br/><br/>I further contend that persons politically situated such as I, have the natural right to engage in all manner of activities common to members of our specie, that is, I have the naturally acquired right to engage in every conceivable manner of activity common to humans, to engage in commerce with any and every person who is willing to engage in commerce with me, no matter what their political status may be . That I have the right to travel to and fro on the common highways and byways of the communities in which I from time to time find myself. To purchase and own every manner of property, to seek employment among other humans who may desire my services or me theirs. That I have the natural right to seek food, clothing, shelter and every other manner of property common to the human species as long as I do so in the manner commonly accepted by those I engage in such intercourse with. <br/><br/>I freely acknowledge that I do not have any right to abuse anyone because of my Sovereign Political status.

That a certified copy of this letter, when presented together with the signed Postal Signature receipt card indicating that the original hereof was received by your office in Little Rock, Arkansas, that such presentation to any and every Arkansas enforcement officer, Sheriff or deputy sheriff, shall constitute and be recognized as being such Diplomatic Recognition. <hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 23, 2009, 6:11am<br/><br/>And this was my OMG for the day.    <img src="http://images.proboards.com/new/shocked.gif" alt=":o" title=":o" border="0"/><br/><br/><a href="http://img244.imageshack.us/my.php?image=codepinkmurder.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/1391/codepinkmurder.th.jpg" alt="[image] " title="[image] " border="0"/></a><br/><br/>'Those who hammer their guns into plows will plow for those who do not.' <br/>~ Thomas Jefferson<br/>(caption that was attached to photo)<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 23, 2009, 6:16am<br/><br/><br/><b><a href="/index.cgi?action=gotopost&board=blogs&thread=4734&post=175265">Apr 21, 2009, 4:57am</a>, cyrellys wrote:</b><table bgcolor="000000" class="bordercolor" cellspacing="1" width="90%"><tr><td width="100%"><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="quote" width="100%"><tr><td width="100%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica" class="quote" size="1">I wandered in to Quayles website tonight to see if anything interesting going on and ran into this below....I'm still looking for the why as to his posting of this...but I suspect it probably has something to do with FEMA - National Level Exercise 2009 (NLE 09).

They will be armed with handheld GPS devices.<br/><br/><br/>Robert LaMacchia, head of the Census Bureau's geography division, says they'll capture the latitude and longitude of the front door of every house, apartment and improvised shelter they find.<br/><br/><br/>&quot;We will actually knock on doors and look for hidden housing units,&quot; he says. &quot;We will find converted garages; from the outside, it may not look like anybody lives there.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>But census workers will add each dwelling, legal or not, to the Census Bureau's Master Address File.<br/><br/><br/>Recent proposed budget cuts have put part of this plan in jeopardy. But if Congress restores the money, the census will end up with the geographic coordinates � accurate to within 10 feet � for about 110 million residences.<br/><br/><br/>But the Census Bureau can't, by law, share that list with anyone, even local governments. LaMacchia says the information has to be treated as confidential. Otherwise, people might lie, and the census wouldn't be accurate.<br/><br/><br/>&quot;People would not tell us about hidden housing units,&quot; LaMacchia says. &quot;People would not respond to the questionnaire if they believed that that information would be turned over to law enforcement or code enforcement and become public information.&quot;<br/><br/>Mapping Might Save Lives<br/>Shoreh Elhami, director of Geographic Information Systems in Delaware County, Ohio, says this sort of information can save lives.<br/>&quot;Having a geographic dataset that is accurate, comprehensive and current is priceless,&quot; Elhami says.<br/>Her passion and devotion have made Delaware County, a fast-growing area just north of Columbus, one of the most meticulously mapped areas of the country.<br/><br/><br/>At her computer, with a few clicks of the mouse, Elhami can pull up a complex, multi-layered picture of Delaware County. Standard commercial software lets her highlight sewer lines, flood plains or real estate tracts. She can pick any address and retrieve pictures of that building from overhead and from the street, along with information about its owner.<br/>The map can answer questions you never expected to ask, she says. Last year, a big storm came through. A reservoir on the Olentangy River, just upstream from the town, was in danger of overflowing, and authorities thought they might have to release water through the dam.<br/><br/><br/>Nobody knew how many people in the town of Delaware might be flooded out of their homes. Elhami rushed to her electronic map. She added a new layer to the picture � an image she'd received from the Army Corps of Engineers showing low-lying areas that would end up under water.<br/>The image showed the outline of the &quot;inundation zone,&quot; and within it, lines and clusters of little red dots. Each of those dots was a house that lay within the potential flood zone.<br/><br/><br/>&quot;The software allows you to do a count of every one of those residences and produce a file of those addresses,&quot; she says.<br/>Elhami delivered that file to emergency managers, and they quickly called the people at each address. Fortunately, the storms subsided, and no flood came.<br/><br/><br/>Every address in the county is in a database, complete with geographic coordinates so it will show up accurately on a map.<br/>Assembling that data is a time-consuming effort. On one recent summer morning, Caleb Gutshall and Sheri Feasel trudged down North Winter Street, in Delaware, checking each address on this commercial strip and making sure that the county's list of occupants was accurate. They also take pictures of any new buildings. One door was unnumbered and locked. Gutshall peered in the window, but learned nothing. &quot;It doesn't look like anybody's in there,&quot; he said.<br/><br/><br/>Now the Census Bureau is planning to undertake much the same kind of effort, on a massive scale, covering the entire country. Elhami says that the Master Address File could be a priceless resource for many counties that don't have the resources to collect that information on their own.<br/>__________________<br/><br/>Last Edited by Phennommennonn on 4/21/2009 at 7:33 AM<br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 23, 2009, 6:29am<br/><br/><a href="http://www.stevequayle.com/index1.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.stevequayle.com/index1.html</a><br/><br/><b>Retired Navy Seal Agrees With Orange Alert </b><br/><br/>Read your Orange Alert and passed it on to my ex Navy Seal friend and his take is as follows: He agrees with your assessment but thinks the time frame is more likely to be by July of this year.

The guy who �wasn�t going to take away our guns�?<br/><br/>Well, guess what?<br/><br/>Less than 100 days into his administration, he�s never met a gun he didn�t hate.  <br/><br/>A week ago, Obama went to Mexico, whined about the United States, and bemoaned (before the whole world) the fact that he didn�t have the political power to take away our semi-automatics.  Nevertheless, that didn�t keep him from pushing additional restrictions on American gun owners.<br/><br/>It�s called the Inter-American Convention Against Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials.  To be sure, this imponderable title masks a really nasty piece of work. <br/><br/>First of all, when the treaty purports to ban the �illicit� manufacture of firearms, what does that mean?<br/><br/>1. �Illicit manufacturing� of firearms is defined as �assembly of firearms [or] ammunition ... without a license....�  <br/><br/>Hence, reloading ammunition -- or putting together a lawful firearm from a kit -- is clearly �illicit manufacturing.�  <br/><br/>Modifying a firearm in any way would surely be �illicit manufacturing.�  And, while it would be a stretch, assembling a firearm after cleaning it could, in any plain reading of the words, come within the screwy definition of �illicit manufacturing.�  <br/><br/>2. �Firearm� has a similarly questionable definition.  <br/><br/>�[A]ny other weapon� is a �firearm,� according to the treaty -- and the term �weapon� is nowhere defined.  <br/><br/>So, is a BB gun a �firearm�?  Probably.  <br/><br/>A toy gun?  Possibly.  <br/><br/>A pistol grip or firing pin?  Probably.  And who knows what else.   <br/><br/>If these provisions (and others) become the law of the land, the Obama administration could have a heyday in enforcing them.  Consider some of the other provisions in the treaty:<br/><br/>* Banning reloading. In Article IV of the treaty, countries commit to adopting �necessary legislative or other measures� to criminalize illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms.  <br/><br/>Remember that �illicit manufacturing� includes reloading and modifying or assembling a firearm in any way.  This would mean that the Obama administration could promulgate regulations banning reloading on the basis of this treaty -- just as it is currently circumventing Congress to write legislation taxing greenhouse gases.<br/><br/>* Banning gun clubs. Article IV goes on to state that the criminalized acts should include �association or conspiracy� in connection with said offenses -- which is arguably a term broad enough to allow, by regulation, the criminalization of entire pro-gun organizations or gun clubs, based on the facilities which they provide their membership.  <br/><br/>* Extraditing US gun dealers. Article V requires each party to �adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the offenses it has established in accordance with this Convention� under a variety of circumstances.  <br/><br/>We know that Mexico is blaming U.S. gun dealers for the fact that its streets are flowing with blood.  And we know it is possible for Mexico to define offenses �committed in its territory� in a very broad way.  And we know that we have an extradition obligation under Article XIX of the proposed treaty.  So we know that Mexico could try to use the treaty to demand to extradition of American gun dealers. <br/><br/>Under Article XXIX, if Mexico demands the extradition of a lawful American gun dealer, the U.S. would be required to resolve the dispute through �other means of peaceful settlement.�<br/><br/>Does anyone want to risk twenty years in a sweltering Mexican jail on the proposition that the Obama administration would apply this provision in a pro-gun manner? <br/><br/>* Microstamping. Article VI requires �appropriate markings� on firearms.  And, it is not inconceivable that this provision could be used to require microstamping of firearms and/or ammunition -- a requirement which is clearly intended to impose specifications which are not technologically possible or which are possible only at a prohibitively expensive cost. <br/><br/>* Gun registration. Article XI requires the maintenance of any records, for a �reasonable time,� that the government determines to be necessary to trace firearms.  This provision would almost certainly repeal portions of McClure-Volkmer and could arguably be used to require a national registry or database.  <br/><br/>ACTION: Write your Senators and urge them to oppose the Inter-American Convention Against Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials. <br/><br/>Please use the Gun Owners Legislative Action Center to send your Senators the pre-written e-mail message below. <br/><br/>----- Pre-written letter -----<br/><br/>Dear Senator:<br/><br/>I am urging you, in the strongest terms, to oppose the Inter-American Convention Against Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials.<br/><br/>This anti-gun treaty was written by international bureaucrats who are either stupid or virulently anti-gun -- or both.   <br/><br/>This treaty could very well ban the ability to reload ammunition, to put new stocks on rifles lawfully owned by American citizens, and, possibly, even ban BB guns!<br/><br/>There are too many problems with this treaty to mention them all in this letter.  The rest can be read on the website of Gun Owners of America at:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gunowners.org/fs0901.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunowners.org/fs0901.htm</a><br/><br/>Please do not tell me the treaty has not yet been abused in this way by the bevy of Third World countries which have signed it.  We do not expect the real ramifications of the treaty to become clear until the big prize -- the U.S. -- has stepped into the trap.<br/><br/>For all of these reasons, I must insist that you oppose ratification of the treaty.    <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 24, 2009, 9:44am<br/><br/>Best of the Best Q-Files<br/>Apr 15 Alex Jones � War Waged Against Americans, listen<br/><br/><a href="http://www.stevequayle.com/qf_april_15_2009.mp3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.stevequayle.com/qf_april_15_2009.mp3</a><br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 24, 2009, 10:11am<br/><br/>Wed 4.22 Steve live in a 2-hr. special with Dr. Steve Pieczenik, topic: Martial Law and the Coming Revolution, <br/><br/>Hr. 1, <br/><a href="http://www.stevequayle.com/qf_april_22_2009_hour_1.mp3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.stevequayle.com/qf_april_22_2009_hour_1.mp3</a><br/><br/>Hr. 2 <br/><a href="http://www.stevequayle.com/qf_april_22_2009_hour_2.mp3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.stevequayle.com/qf_april_22_2009_hour_2.mp3</a><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by olddood on Apr 24, 2009, 10:45am<br/><br/>Yes, that is REALLY hard to listen too.  <br/>Cy, can you point out certain 'times' where we should be paying attention?<br/><br/>I wish that whoever made this video put in captions...<br/><br/>EDIT: I was talking about the Alan Keyes Video...<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 24, 2009, 11:02am<br/><br/><a href="http://www.gunsandammoenthusiastblog.com/all-private-guns-will-be-confiscated-by-september-2009-us-tells-russia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunsandammoenthusiastblog.com....s-tells-russia/</a><br/><br/>17 April 2009<br/><br/>ALL PRIVATE GUNS WILL BE CONFISCATED BY SEPTEMBER 2009, US TELLS RUSSIA<br/><br/>Truth, Lies, bull crap? Read below and you decide.<br/><br/>Kremlin reports on the extraordinary meeting held today between President Medvedev and former United States Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger (under Nixon), James Baker (under Bush Sr.), Charles Shultz (under Regan), former United States Defense Secretary William Perry (under Clinton), and former US Senator and top defense expert Sam Nunn, are stating that the Americans are acknowledging for the first time their acceptance of a New Global Order in which they seek to partner with natural resource rich Russia and the oil rich Nations of the Middle East in order to ensure their survival into the 21st Century.<br/>Leading the United States to the shocking conclusion that their very survival is at risk has been the evaporation of 45 percent of the World�s wealth which has caused a rapid plunge in Global manufacturing leading to a 49 percent collapse in US trade exports which the International Monetary Fund is reported has caused the World�s economy to shrink for the first time in 60 years and has lead Canada�s Central Bank chief David Dodge to state the World is �facing a long and deep recession that will fundamentally alter the nature of capitalism�.<br/><br/>Though Prime Minister Putin has warned that �resorting to a printing press would be unwise and extremely dangerous�, the already bankrupt United States, whose staggering debt is four times higher than their entire National income, has allowed its Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben �Throw Money Out of Helicopters� Bernanke to �create out of thin air� a further $1.2 Trillion to stabilize the American economy, but which in turn has led to the collapse of the US Dollar leading the United Nations to recommend next week that the World �ditch the dollar as its reserve currency in favor of a shared basket of currencies�.<br/><br/>Russian economists further state in these reports that the United States has been left with �no other option� than to force the massive devaluation of the US Dollar in order to �shake lose� from banks and private investors the hundreds of billions they are currently hoarding and is being blamed for collapsing a United States where consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of its economy and which without money to borrow, or borrowers to loan to, is fast approaching the abyss.<br/><br/>With the devaluation of the US dollar, however, massive inflation will ensue causing the value of these currently hoarded hundreds of billions of US Dollars to plummet and forcing them to be spent before they become totally worthless, a policy which China, the largest Global holder of US debt, has voiced increasing concerns about and have cut back on their purchases of American debt even as desperation hits their own factories as orders plunge.<br/>These top American Officials have also assured President Medvedev that new laws being written by the Obama administration will �completely� reform the American financial system by fully integrating it into a single Global Economy due to be enacted during the coming G-20 summit in London.<br/>When President Medvedev voiced his concerns to the Americans over his belief that the US Congress would not allow such a radical new set of laws to pass, these reports continue, Kissinger stated that the American people were being �primed� to overwhelm their lawmakers into swiftly enacting �in its entirety� the Obama administrations new banking and financial laws by the outrageous behavior of those collapsed financial giants that includes: 1.) The insurance giant AIG which after receiving over $300 billion in US taxpayer money paid out nearly $200 million in bonuses; 2.) The collapsed stock selling giant Merrill Lynch which after receiving $20 billion in US taxpayer money paid out $3.6 billion in bonuses; and 3.) The collapsed US banking giant Citigroup who after receiving $45 billion in US taxpayer money announced a $10 million redecoration of their executive office suites.<br/>News from the United States today further confirm Kissinger�s assertions to President Medvedev as US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has now admitted that he had ordered US Senator Christopher Dodd to include the executive pay provision into the stimulus bill which was, in fact, a loophole allowing these controversial bonuses to be paid out.<br/><br/><font color="Yellow">To such machinations being utilized by their supposed �leaders� against them in order to pave the road from a once sovereign United States to this New World Order these Americans remain nearly clueless, <font size="3">but when pressed by President Medvedev on the plans to ensure that civil society on the North American continent doesn�t break down Kissinger reportedly replied, �By September we�ll have confiscated all privately owned guns so it really doesn�t matter what we do, we�ll still be in charge�.</font></font><br/><br/>Russian Intelligence reports state that gun ownership statistics in the United States vary widely, but is estimated to be that nearly 50 percent of US households have nearly 270 million guns, none of which these Americans seem now ready to part with without a fight.<br/><br/>But, new reports coming from the United States show that they are fast adopting the tactics used by the German Nazis to disarm their society prior to the installation of fascist rule and martial law by first rendering all private guns useless by eliminating and restricting the ammunition they use. And from new reports coming from the United States we can see that this �plan� is already being instituted with ammunition shortages being reported in Idaho, Georgia, and Louisiana, and a new law just introduced in California which would:<br/><br/>1. Stop the private transfer between individuals of more than 50 rounds of ammunition.<br/><br/>2. License and tax anyone selling handgun ammunition commercially and force these stores to get background checks on anyone selling ammunition.<br/><br/>3. Get a thumbprint from anyone buying handgun ammunition.<br/><br/>4. Ban all ammunition sales that don�t take place face-to- face, in other words, ban mail-order sales.<br/><br/>Even more chilling for American gun owners was the Obama administrations order to the US Military on March 12 which stated Effective immediately DOD Surplus, LLC, will be implementing new requirements for mutilation of fired shell casings. The new DRMS requirement calls for DOD Surplus personnel to witness the mutilation of the property and sign the Certificate of Destruction.� which would have crippled the US ammunition industry, who are the largest purchasers of used military ammunition brass, but after found out about by US Senators was quickly withdrawn.<br/><br/>To the reasons feared by the leadership class in the United States of their citizens retaining the right to firearms we can read:<br/>�As the growing world-wide economic crisis deepens, military forces from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom are preparing to meet angry citizens on the street. The economic crisis - and the public outrage it is causing - is at the forefront of intelligence agencies and military forces in the western world.<br/><br/>Prominent trends forecaster Gerald Celente has been sounding the alarm for years, warning that riots and tax revolts are coming to America. The Pentagon, U. K. Ministry of Defense, and Canadian military apparently agree. In November of 2008 the United States Army War College released the report Known Unknowns: Unconventional �Strategic Shocks� in Defense Strategy Development. The report identifies economic collapse as a reason for the defense establishment to conduct domestic operations. The report states,<br/><br/>�Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security. Deliberate employment of weapons of mass destruction or other catastrophic capabilities, unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency��<br/>The CIA and MI5 are both watching the economic situation for signs of unrest and  olitical instability. As the Washington Post reports, the CIA has added an economic situation report to its threat assessment for the White House. A further sign that the United States government is anticipating widespread unrest comes with the domestic stationing of the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division. The Army Times reports,<br/>�They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-yield explosive, or CBRNE, attack.�<br/><br/>Canadian military forces have been given a nearly identical domestic mission in a synchronized move with the United States. Canada�s National Post reports that, �The Canadian military has embarked on a wide-ranging plan to turn its reserve soldiers into focused units trained and equipped to respond to a nightmarish array of domestic threats, including terrorist �dirty bomb� attacks, biological agent containment, Arctic catastrophes and natural disasters.�<br/><br/>Reports from the United States are also revealing that for the first time since their Civil War, active duty US Army Troops were put into the streets of Alabama after the killing spree of a crazed gunman, but which the US Army is now reporting it is �investigating� because it doesn�t know who deployed them.<br/><br/>To whom the leadership elite in America are actually planning on protecting themselves from we can further read: �A new document meant to help Missouri law enforcement agencies identify militia members or domestic terrorists has drawn criticism for some of the warning signs mentioned.<br/>The Feb. 20 report called �The Modern Militia Movement� mentions such red flags as political bumper stickers for third-party candidates, such as U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, who ran for president last year; talk of conspiracy theories, such as the plan for a superhighway linking Canada to Mexico; and possession of subversive literature.�<br/><br/>As to what these dangerous American terrorists can expect once they are in the custody of their US intelligence services?<br/><br/>�The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) concluded in 2007 that US methods to extract information from prisoners at secret CIA jails as part of the �war on terror� amounted to torture.�<br/><br/>Even worse for these dissident Americans are the chilling revelations from top investigative news journalist Seymour Hersh: �After 9/11, I haven�t written about this yet, but the Central Intelligence Agency was very deeply involved in domestic activities against people they thought to be enemies of the state. Without any legal authority for it. They haven�t been called on it yet. That does happen.�<br/><br/>So today, as  the United States �watch list� for domestic and International terrorists has hit 1 million names, in a country that already has more prisoners than any other Nation in the World, or our entire Earths� history for that matter, and as sales of weapons and ammunition are still hitting record highs in America since President Obama�s election, it would appear more than likely that the assertions of US officials to Russia that they remain in control of their country is highly doubtful�and needing just one single �spark� to plunge it into full scale civil war.<br/><br/>And whose to say that hasn�t been their �plan� all along?<br/>[Ed.

The initial requests seem reasonable enough when FEMA asks the county officials to prepare a Hazard Mitigation Plan to deal with flooding, fires, high winds and tornadoes.<br/><br/>But as the required meetings and calls with FEMA and DHS continue over a two year period their request become more unusual, raising suspicions of county officials<br/><br/>From the audio: <br/><br/>We want to know every important thing in this county. We want to know where police departments are. Where weapons are stored. Hazardous material. Where can we land a helicopter. Where are the airports. How big a plane can you land at the airport. Where are all the bridges. Where are all the power stations. Where are all the generating stations.Where are all the substations. They literally wanted to know where everything was. Im sitting there thinking man if there was ever martial law. This kind of information is exactly the kind of stuff they are going to want. Were just laying it all out for them right there.<br/><br/>During the legally mandated meetings held with FEMA and DHS different disaster scenarios were reveled to county officials:<br/><br/>� In late December 2008 municipal officials were invited to Indianapolis for a briefing on the state of Indiana. There were told if industry were to collapse for example GM going bankrupt resulting in mass unemployment a depression would soon follow and municipalities could expect to loose 40% of their funds.<br/><br/>� Every county in the nation would be required to prepare a Hazard Mitigation Plan.<br/><br/>� The county should prepare a plan to vaccinate the entire population within 48 hours and practice the plan several times.<br/><br/>� FEMA inquired to where mass graves could be placed in the county and would they accept bodies from elsewhere.<br/><br/>� The sheriffs department via the state sheriff association was told that no .223 ammunition rounds would be available as the military would be purchasing all stocks.<br/><br/>� The county was asked to make plans for hardening of police and fire stations, putting in hardened bunker type buildings around town.<br/><br/>� The county was asked to make plans for the possibility of up to 400,000 refugees from Chicago. <br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 24, 2009, 12:24pm<br/><br/>Posted by DAN:<br/><b>New (temporary) Rule - DS section</b><br/>� Thread Started Today at 4:58am �   <br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>With the kind forbearance of the Admins, this New Rule will apply in this DS section for the next three (3) months OR until CK is no longer able to maintain the fa�ade that something serious is afoot with BHO/R&D, whichever comes sooner. <br/><br/>Participation in the DS section of OM will be strongly discouraged unless you can abide by the following two conditions: <br/><br/>1.)

This is part of the plan, of course, because the monetary elite control not only the financial system but also the news media, the publishing industry, and the educational system. The blueprint for control was put together over a century ago by Cecil Rhodes and his friends, including British financier Nathan Rothschild, as documented by Professor Carroll Quigley.<br/>During the 20th Century the power shifted to the U.S., with the Rockefellers playing the dominant role as they continue to do today. It is no accident that J.P. Morgan Chase�the Rockefeller family bank�dominates the U.S. derivatives market; nor that Exxon-Mobil, the Rockefellers' oil company, is the most profitable corporation in history.<br/>The basic plan was to place all of mankind in a state of permanent mental and emotional siege so that in the end we would trade all our liberties to the controllers in return for protection; even freedom of thought would be traded for physical safety. That plan is well advanced. The sheeple have been prepared for the final shearing.<br/>Meanwhile, every attempt at real reform has been strangled in the cradle. Past voices for monetary sanity like those of Congressmen Louis McFadden and Jerry Voorhis were silenced. Starting in the 1970s, functionaries like Kissinger, Brzezinski, and Volcker carried out David Rockefeller's plan to outsource manufacturing to China and eliminate the U.S. as the world's greatest industrial democracy, replacing it with a financier oligarchy.<br/>Barack Obama obviously works mainly for the financiers, as did Bill Clinton before him. The job of the Democrats is to keep the sheeple quiet by now and then implementing some �reforms�; the Republicans were a more blatant gang of looters. <br/>During the 2008 election campaign, Ron Paul called for the end of the Federal Reserve, the bastion of financier control, but no one effectively organized the millions of people who responded to his call or had a viable plan to put in place. Barack Obama obviously works mainly for the financiers, as did Bill Clinton before him. The job of the Democrats is to keep the sheeple quiet by now and then implementing some �reforms�; the Republicans were a more blatant gang of looters.  <br/>With the financial crash of 2008-2009, the noose is tightening everywhere in the world. The International Monetary Fund is announcing, �The current global recession is likely to be �unusually long and severe, and the recovery sluggish.'� (BBC News, �IMF Sees Long and Severe Slowdown,� April 16, 2009.) In reality, as the IMF knows, it would be possible to put every nation in the world on the road to recovery by allowing them to prime the economic pump through sovereign control of their own monetary systems, with freedom to utilize their own natural resources.<br/>The IMF announcement is in fact the start of a worldwide program of genocide similar to what was done to Russia in the 1990s, with crushing poverty, slashing of incomes, reduction of benefits for the poor and elderly, rising levels of disease and malnutrition, and reduction of life expectancy. We in the West will view the carnage with alarm from our own stripped-down economies but remain docile out of fear the same will be done to us.   <br/>Awareness of the hideous evil of the financiers' plans to destroy the soul of humanity is growing. This is being accomplished through the internet and the work of a number of writers who understand what is at stake. I doubt this channel of expression will be available indefinitely. Already alternative websites are being isolated and marginalized. But the fight must be waged.<br/>The one organization that has a program which is comprehensive and free from outside influence is the American Monetary Institute, which has drafted the American Monetary Act. If the Act is introduced in Congress, it will be imperative for it to be recognized and supported as the one chance to save our nation from the dark night that is threatening. But even progressive writers shrink from taking on the Monetary Power, with many of them putting forth the absurdity that all we need to do is reform the banking system.<br/>The American Monetary Act has been in process since 2003. It may be found on the AMI website at: <a href="http://www.monetary.org/amacolorpamphlet.pdf." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.monetary.org/amacolorpamphlet.pdf.</a> AMI will conduct a presentation on the Act on Capitol Hill, April 23, 2009, in Room 304 of the Cannon House Office Building. Presentations will take place at 10:00 AM and at 2:00 PM.<br/>At the same time, groups of relatively conscious people can come together on their own to create refuges of sanity until the danger passes�over a period of years, decades, or even generations. And, to look at it from a spiritual perspective, we can hope that the Higher Powers who observe humanity's destiny refuse to allow our particular experiment in consciousness to be obliterated.<br/>Destruction of human consciousness is the real goal of the financiers and their minions. It is lies above all that do this. The financiers' power is the biggest lie of all.<br/>Richard C. Cook is a retired federal analyst who writes today on economic, political, and spiritual matters.

While I do disagree with it in many regards I do treat it with respect as one of many interpretations to this Paradigm as an option to how humanity might choose to interpret and react in regards to the Contact Paradigm and Human Potential.  I have made it quite clear in the past that I did not agree with readiness for an existential leap on the scale of the one you propose.  Or that an eschaton type sitation will net the results you expect.  Life tramas leave horrible marks and baggage upon the human spirit, an eschaton type event is very destructive/damaging to spiritual evolution for this reason.  But I don't exclude this interpretation from the cadre of ones existing because that would be interfereing with honorable free will.<br/><br/>I do however take/have tremendous vehemence in opposition with a continuance of unethical, immoral, and illegal behavior regarding this paradigm.  It is unnecessary and your manipulations of humanity in those manners paint you, your brethren, and many less informed participants and collateral parties as horrendously evil whether deserved or not!

Few people ventured onto the streets, and some wore face masks. Canada became the third country to confirm cases, in six people, including some students who - like some New York City spring-breakers - got mildly ill in Mexico. Countries across Asia promised to quarantine feverish travelers returning from flu-affected areas. <br/><br/>The U.S. declared the health emergency so it could ship roughly 12 million doses of flu-fighting medications from a federal stockpile to states in case they eventually need them - although with 20 confirmed cases of people recovering easily, they don't appear to for now. <br/><br/>Make no mistake: There is not a global pandemic - at least not yet. It's not clear how many people truly have this particular strain, or why all countries but Mexico are seeing mild disease. Nor is it clear if the new virus spreads easily, one milestone that distinguishes a bad flu from a global crisis. But waiting to take protective steps until after a pandemic is declared would be too late. <br/><br/>&quot;We do think this will continue to spread but we are taking aggressive actions to minimize the impact on people's health,&quot; said Dr. Richard Besser, acting chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <br/><br/>President Barack Obama's administration sought to look both calm and in command, striking a balance between informing Americans without panicking them. Obama himself was playing golf while U.S. officials used a White House news conference to compare the emergency declaration with preparing for an approaching hurricane. <br/><br/>&quot;Really that's what we're doing right now. We're preparing in an environment where we really don't know ultimately what the size or seriousness of this outbreak is going to be,&quot; Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters. <br/><br/>Earlier, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the outbreak was serious, but that the public should know &quot;it's not a time to panic.&quot; He told NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that Obama was getting updates &quot;every few hours&quot; on the situation. <br/><br/>In Mexico, soldiers handed out 6 million surgical-style masks to deal with a deadly flu strain that officials say may have sickened 1,400 people since April 13. Special laboratory tests to confirming how many died from it - 22 so far out of the 86 suspected deaths - and not something else is taking time. <br/><br/>The World Bank said it would send Mexico with $25 million in loans for immediate aid and $180 million in long-term assistance to address the outbreak, plus advice on how other nations have dealt with similar crises. <br/><br/>The World Health Organization and U.S. were following a playbook of precautions developed over the past five years to prepare for the next super-flu. The WHO on Saturday asked all countries to step up detection of this strain of A/H1N1 swine flu and will reconsider on Tuesday whether to raise the pandemic threat level, in turn triggering additional actions. <br/>A potential pandemic virus is defined, among other things, as a novel strain that's not easily treated. This new strain can be treated with Tamiflu and Relenza, but not two older flu drugs. Also, the WHO wants to know if it's easily spread from one person to a second who then spreads it again - something U.S. officials suspect and are investigating. <br/><br/>&quot;Right now we have cases occurring in a couple of different countries and in multiple locations, but we also know that in the modern world that cases can simply move around from single locations and not really become established,&quot; cautioned WHO flu chief Dr. Keiji Fukuda. <br/><br/>There is no vaccine against swine flu, but the CDC has taken the initial step necessary for producing one - creating a seed stock of the virus - should authorities decide that's necessary. Last winter's flu shot offers no cross-protection to the new virus, although it's possible that older people exposed to various Type A flu strains in the past may have some immunity, CDC officials said Sunday. <br/><br/>Worldwide, attention focused sharply on travelers. <br/><br/>&quot;It was acquired in Mexico, brought home and spread,&quot; Nova Scotia's chief public health officer, Dr. Robert Strang, said of Canada's first four confirmed cases, in student travelers. <br/>New Zealand said 10 students who took a school trip to Mexico &quot;likely&quot; had swine flu. Spanish authorities had seven suspected cases under observation. A New York City school where eight cases are confirmed will be closed Monday and Tuesday. <br/><br/>China, Russia and Taiwan began planning to put quarantine travelers arriving from flu-affected areas if they have symptoms. Italy, Poland and Venezuela advised citizens to postpone travel to affected parts of Mexico and the U.S. <br/><br/>The U.S. hasn't advised against travel to Mexico but does urge precautions such as frequent hand-washing while there, and began questioning arriving travelers about flu symptoms. <br/>--- <br/>Associated Press writers Mark Stevenson and Olga R.

Either it is most definitely weaponized and genetically manufactured which is what I really think it is and has thus been unleased in some areas on purpose for this NWO de-population they have wanted to pull on the people here; or 2. It is parasites entering our atmosphere and more concentrated in some areas than others thus this is why so many in Mexico are getting it.<br/> <br/>Now if we go to Nancy Lieder's Zetatalk.com site she has now stated or she did last night during her online chat session on Godlikeproductions that it is a manufactured virus and who is to gain the most from this?

The World Health Organization warned Saturday that the outbreak could reach global pandemic levels.<br/><br/>Is Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork packer and hog producer, linked to the outbreak? Smithfield operates massive hog-raising operations Perote, Mexico, in the state of Vera Cruz, where the outbreak originated. The operations, grouped under a Smithfield subsidiary called Granjas Carrol, raise 950,000 hogs per year, according to the company Web site—a level nearly equal to Smithfield’s total U.S. hog production.<br/><br/>On Friday, the U.S. disease-tracking blog Biosurveillance published a timeline of the outbreak containing this nugget, dated April 6 (major tip of the hat to Paula Hay, who alerted me to the Smithfield link on the Comfood listserv and has written about it on her blog, Peak Oil Entrepreneur):<br/><br/>Residents [of Perote] believed the outbreak had been caused by contamination from pig breeding farms located in the area. They believed that the farms, operated by Granjas Carroll, polluted the atmosphere and local water bodies, which in turn led to the disease outbreak. According to residents, the company denied responsibility for the outbreak and attributed the cases to “flu.” However, a municipal health official stated that preliminary investigations indicated that the disease vector was a type of fly that reproduces in pig waste and that the outbreak was linked to the pig farms. It was unclear whether health officials had identified a suspected pathogen responsible for this outbreak.<br/><br/>From what I can tell, the possible link to Smithfield has not been reported in the U.S. press. Searches of Google News and the websites of the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal all came up empty. The link is being made in the Mexican media, however. “Granjas Carroll, causa de epidemia en La Gloria,” declared a headline in the Vera Cruz-based paper La Marcha. No need to translate that, except to point out that La Gloria is the village where the outbreak seems to have started. Judging from the article, Mexican authorities treat hog CAFOs with just as much if not more indulgence than their peers north of the border, to the detriment of surrounding communities and the general public health. Get this:<br/><br/>De acuerdo con uno de los habitantes de la comunidad, Eli Ferrer Cortés, los desechos fecales y orgánicos que produce Granjas Carroll no son tratados adecuadamente, lo que genera contaminación del agua y del viento en la region.<br/><br/>My rough translation: According to one community resident, the organic and fecal waste produced by Granjas Carrol isn’t adequately treated, creating water and air pollution in the region. I witnessed—and smelled—the same thing in Hardin County, Iowa, a couple of years ago, another area marked by intensive industrial hog production. The article goes on to say that area residents have long complained of “fetid odors” in the air and water, and swarms of flies hovering around waste lagoons. Like their counterparts who live in CAFO-heavy U.S. areas, they also complain of respiratory ailments. Now, with 30 percent of the area’s residents now infected with the virulent flu bug, people are demanding that state and federal authorities inspect hog operations there. So far, reports La Marcha, the response has been: nada.<br/><br/>The Mexico City daily La Jornada has also made the link. According to the newspaper, the Mexican health agency IMSS has acknowledged that the orginal carrier for the flu could be the “clouds of flies” that multiply in the Smithfield subsidiary’s manure lagoons.<br/><br/>I’ll be in touch with contacts in Mexico as this story develops —and I’ll be curious to see whether the U.S. media explores the link with Smithfield’s Mexico operation.<br/><br/>Grist food editor Tom Philpott farms and cooks at Maverick Farms, a sustainable-agriculture nonprofit and small farm in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.<br/><br/>===================================================================================================================== ===<br/><br/><br/>News Updates from Citizens For Legitimate Government<br/>26 Apr 2009<br/><a href="http://www.legitgov.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.legitgov.org/</a><br/>All items are here:<br/><a href="http://www.legitgov.org/#breaking_news" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.legitgov.org/#breaking_news</a><br/><br/><br/>CLG: Baxter working on vaccine to stop swine flu, though admitted sending live pandemic flu viruses to subcontractor By Lori Price 26 Apr 2009 The OMFG moment of the century.

PREPARE TO SHOOT THE BASTARDS!<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.rense.com/general85/BIO.HTM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.rense.com/general85/BIO.HTM</a><br/><br/><br/>Mexican Swine Flu<br/>An Advanced Biowar Event<br/>That Will Be Bigger Than 9/11<br/>By The Earl of Stirling<br/>4-25-9<br/> <br/><br/>On 23rd April 2009 the world began to become aware of a very strange new version of swine flu H1N1 in Mexico with limited cases in Texas and California. By the morning of the 24th of April, we began hear that there were hundreds of sick and 20 or so dead. By late in the day, we have learned that over 1,000 are now reported ill and over 60 are reported dead. There are solid reasons to suspect that this new Mexican Swine Flu is NOT a naturally occurring event but instead is an Advanced Biological Warfare recombination DNA genetically engineered virus.<br/> <br/><br/>Here is what we know of the virus so far. This virus has already gone international having crossed the border from Mexico to America. All schools in Mexico City have been canceled, millions of students told to stay home due to Mexican Swine Flu. Sick victims of this strange new virus are currently reported in California and Texas. Over 60 deaths reported in Mexico (could be substantially higher considering the state of Mexican health care and reporting).<br/> <br/><br/>Young healthy adults seem to be the most at risk. This is similar to the deadest killer flu in history, Spanish Flu in 1918. Most if not all nations with advanced biological warfare programs have been interested in recreating the Spanish Flu DNA sequence and several are reported to have done so.<br/> <br/><br/>The new Mexican Swine Flu has elements of DNA from the following: avian flu, human flu Type A, human flu Type B, Asian swine flu, and European swine flu. A strange combination never seen before and having less than 1/10% chance of being a natural event. Human and animal viruses from four or more continents suddenly recombine in a new flu during a non-flu season that spreads from human-to-human with a 10% fatality rating.<br/> <br/><br/>Over 1,000 reported infected in Mexico; true rate may be much higher. Mexico City seems to be the epicenter of the new virus. Mexico City has 20 million citizens, most terribly poor. Mexico City is notorious for its poor sanitation and public health. &quot;Don't drink the water&quot; has been the byword in Mexico City for decades. It is the perfect breading ground for an explosive growth of this new killer virus. Mexico City has closed all schools, public gatherings, public buildings. People are wearing medical masks on the streets. The government has announced a massive new emergency swine flu vaccination program that will be, at best, either totally non-effective or of very limited effect, and could be, at worst, a deadly option for patients. It is thought that the authorities are trying to contain public panic by announcing the vaccination program.<br/> <br/><br/>Both the World Health Organization and the US CDC (Center for Disease Control) have announced, today/24th April, that they are 'very concerned' about a global pandemic developing out of this new disease. Based on advanced biowargaming projections, it is already too late to stop the global spread of this new killer disease. Based on the three waves of Spanish Flu, the latter ones being more lethal, fatality rates may range from approximately 10% to 40% or so in later waves. More people could die in America, Mexico, Canada, Europe, and globally from Mexican Swine Flu than died in World War II.<br/> <br/><br/>This new flu is a lab created advanced biological warfare DNA genetically engineered virus that either: (1) Escaped accidentally from a lab; or (2) was deliberately released by a nation or non-state organization or a well-trained individual.<br/> <br/><br/>If there is a positive side to this coming global disaster, it may force governments to quickly come to grips with containing advanced biowar attacks. This is of considerable short term importance as Israel is apt to attack Iran by no later than mid-July 2009. The Iranians, having hired a large number of key ex-Soviet advanced biowar scientists 18 years ago and having spent billions on their asymmetrical MAD (mutually assured destruction) counter-force, are expected to respond to any significant attack on Iran with a biowar attack on Israel, North America, and Europe using in-place agents and dozens of genetically engineered viruses, many with very high projected kill rates.<br/> <br/><br/>This event is an advanced biological warfare event. It is far more important than 9/11 and, by itself, could bring deaths in such magnitudes as to exceed the number of deaths from all causes in the Second World War.<br/> <br/><br/>Stirling<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/>===================================================================================================================== ====================<br/><br/><br/>From: &quot;Jacob G.

Medical Director (video clip here).<br/><br/><br/>Alarming reports are now filtering in about people catching the illness who have had no contact with pigs whatsoever. These include a man and his daughter in San Diego County, a 41-year-old woman in Imperial County and two teenagers in San Antonio, Texas. In fact, in all U.S. cases, the victims had no contact with any pigs.<br/><br/><br/>Dr. Wilma Wooten, San Diego County's public health officer, told KPBS &quot;We have had person-to-person spread with the father and the daughter,&quot; says Wooten, &quot;And also with the two teenagers in Texas, they were in the same school. So that also indicates person-to-person transfer.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Dr. Wooten says it's unclear how people were exposed to swine flu. She says none of the patients have had any contact with pigs, according to the report.<br/><br/><br/>Although the situation in the U.S. looks under control, panic is spreading in Mexico, where 800 cases of pneumonia in the capital alone are suspected to be related to the swine flu and the virus has hit young and healthy people, which is very rare with an flu outbreak. Despite the danger of a pandemic, the U.S. border with Mexico remains open.<br/><br/><br/>&quot;Mexico has shut schools and museums and canceled hundreds of public events in its sprawling, overcrowded capital of 20 million people to try to prevent further infections,&quot; reports Reuters.<br/><br/><br/>&quot;My level of concern is significant,&quot; said Dr. Martin Fenstersheib, the health officer for Santa Clara County. &quot;We have a novel virus, a brand-new strain that's spreading human to human, and we are also seeing a virulent strain in Mexico that seems to be related. We certainly have concerns for this escalating.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>The WHO insists that the outbreak has &quot;pandemic potential&quot; and has been stockpiling supplies of Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, a pill that can both treat flu and prevent infection, according to officials.<br/><br/><br/>As we previously highlighted, those that have a stake in the Tamiflu vaccine include top globalists and BIlderberg members like George Shultz, Lodewijk J.R. de Vink and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.<br/><br/><br/>Indeed, Rumsfeld himself played a key role in hyping an outbreak of swine flu back in the 1976 when he urged the entire country to get vaccinated. Many batches of the vaccine were contaminated, resulting in hundreds of sick people and 52 fatalities.<br/><br/><br/>The fact that the properties of the strain are completely new, that the virus is spreading from people to people, and that the young and healthy are being hit worst, has disturbing parallels to the deadly 1918 pandemic that killed millions.<br/><br/><br/>It is unclear as to why, if the virus is a brand new strain, that public health officials are so confident programs of mass vaccination, which are already being prepared, would necessarily be effective.<br/><br/><br/>It certainly wouldn't be the first time that deadly flu viruses have been concocted in labs and then dispatched with the intention of creating a pandemic.<br/><br/><br/>When the story first broke last month, Czech newspapers questioned if the shocking discovery of vaccines contaminated with the deadly avian flu virus which were distributed to 18 countries by the American company Baxter were part of a conspiracy to provoke a pandemic.<br/><br/><br/>Since the probability of mixing a live virus biological weapon with vaccine material by accident is virtually impossible, this leaves no other explanation than that the contamination was a deliberate attempt to weaponize the H5N1 virus to its most potent extreme and distribute it via conventional flu vaccines to the population who would then infect others to a devastating degree as the disease went airborne.<br/><br/><br/>However, this is not the first time that vaccine companies have been caught distributing vaccines contaminated with deadly viruses.<br/><br/><br/>In 2006 it was revealed that Bayer Corporation had discovered that their injection drug, which was used by hemophiliacs, was contaminated with the HIV virus. Internal documents prove that after they positively knew that the drug was contaminated, they took it off the U.S. market only to dump it on the European, Asian and Latin American markets, knowingly exposing thousands, most of them children, to the live HIV virus. Government officials in France went to prison for allowing the drug to be distributed. The documents show that the FDA colluded with Bayer to cover-up the scandal and allowed the deadly drug to be distributed globally. No Bayer executives ever faced arrest or prosecution in the United States.<br/><br/><br/>In the UK, a 2007 outbreak of foot and mouth disease that put Britain on high alert has been originated from a government laboratory which is shared with an American pharmaceutical company, mirroring the deadly outbreak of 2001, which was also deliberately released.<br/><br/><br/>As we reported yesterday, last time there was a significant outbreak of a new form of swine flu in the U.S. it originated at the army base at Fort Dix, New Jersey.<br/><br/><br/>Swine Flu Is Deadly Mix Of Never-Before-Seen Viruses<br/><a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/medical-director-swine-flu-was-cultured-in-a-laboratory.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.prisonplanet.com/medical-dire....laboratory.html</a><br/><br/><br/>===================================================================================================================== ====================<br/><br/><br/>From: dgw &lt;dgwest7@...&gt;<br/>Date: April 26, 2009 4:40:24 AM GMT-05:00<br/>Subject: [SPAM]  [Fwd: [the_octopus] Timely -- Pandemic vaccine training exercised scheduled in Texas Sat. May 2 (NEXT WEEK)]<br/><br/><br/>Something Wicked <br/>This Way Comes<br/>Scene I, Act II|<br/> By  A. True Ott, PhD, ND<br/>4-24-9<br/><a href="http://www.rense." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.rense.</a> com/general85/ wicked.htm<br/><br/><br/><br/>On March 20, 2009, this researcher outlined a peculiar &quot;PANDEMIC VACCINE TRAINING&quot; exercise in Texas scheduled to occur on Saturday, May 2, 2009. See complete article at <a href="http://www.rense." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.rense.</a> com/general85/ dsd2.htm <br/> <br/>I thought it very strange that a rather obscure Texas county would see fit to conduct such a &quot;training exercise&quot; involving Texas National Guard Troops involving &quot;drive-thru vaccination clinics&quot;. I also thought it exceedingly strange that these rather obscure county officials would make the public declarations that emergency &quot;pandemic vaccination programs would mean a line of cars 41 miles long&quot; in Guadalupe County, but that San Antonio's drive-thru vaccine's line would stretch from &quot;San Antonio to Calgary, Alberta Canada&quot; --- strange, because this just happens to be the planned route of the AMERO FREEWAY -- connecting the late-great U.S.A. with Mexico and Canada.    Could this, too, be a coded message to insiders?<br/> <br/>Just as NORAD was conducting &quot;mock&quot; terrorist drills on the morning of September 11, 2001 - could this May 2 event be TIMED to announce the release of the planned pandemic and the eventual advent of martial law in North America?  <br/> <br/>Today, Friday, April 24, 2009 - according to USA TODAY, the BBC, and the Associated Press,  the World Health Organization (WHO) is &quot;very, very concerned&quot; about a very strange &quot;swine flu&quot; outbreak in Mexico City.  <br/><a href="http://www.usatoday" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday</a> .com/news/ health/2009- 04-23-swine- flu_N.htm? csp=34  The WHO is so concerned, in fact, that it has ordered all WHO officers to man the &quot;Pandemic Control Room&quot; 24/7 for the 1st time. <br/> <br/>ATTENTION AMERICA!!!! This is highly significant. The WHO &quot;Pandemic Control Room&quot; is a creation of the Illuminati elite for the final &quot;end-game&quot; killer virus mapping and tracking, and is thus equipped with super-computers tied to all U.N. member government's security forces.  This &quot;control room&quot; is where any declarations of &quot;pandemic&quot; will originate. When such a &quot;declaration&quot; is sent to President Obama, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security &quot;Pandemic Task Forces&quot; will be deployed. Each State Governor will be notified that the provisions of the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) will be implemented. <br/> <br/>This means that all Americans must consent to mass vaccinations, or be guilty of a FELONY crime (without a TRIAL, mind you!). And why a FELONY and not a mere 'misdemeanor' ? Simple.  Police agencies know that the use of &quot;DEADLY FORCE&quot; is only approved for felony suspects when they resist arrest.  Refuse the government's untested, untried, highly suspect &quot;MADE IN CHINA&quot; vaccine, and you will instantly be labelled a felonious criminal. So, refuse the forced vaccine, and then resist forced relocation to a prepared &quot;quarantine compound&quot; (i.e. concentration/ re-education camp) and you can &quot;legally&quot; be shot and killed. (Justified &quot;deadly force&quot;.) See <a href="http://www.forhealt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.forhealt</a> hfreedom. org/Publications /Informed/ RevisedModelStat e.html   <br/> <br/>Never forget that in 2005, the Chinese PLA &quot;defense minister&quot; declared in a speech to the Chinese PLA brass that China must &quot;possess&quot; North America (Mexico, America, and Canada) and that 15-200 million Americans &quot;must die&quot; by means of a &quot;perfected&quot; biological weapon. What could be more &quot;natural&quot; and deflect suspicion more effectively than a weaponized &quot;killer influenza&quot; that is propagandized into an &quot;act of nature&quot;??<br/> <br/>Beginning in the spring of 1918, an &quot;unusual flu&quot; began to emerge, that eventually blossomed into the killer flu pandemic killing millions worldwide. Subsequent research has proven that the &quot;unusual flu&quot; was a &quot;recombinant strain&quot; showing swine viruses mixed with bird viruses mutating with human-specific strains of flu virus. THIS IS EXACTLY THE KILLER VIRUS THAT DR. JEFFREY TAUBENBERGER AND HIS TEAM AT FORT DEDRICK RE-CREATED DURING YEARS 1997 - 2003. Is it just a mere coincidence that the same recombinant virus is once again making its appearance known? <br/> <br/>According to Henry Kissinger and Zbignew Brezinsky's &quot;NEW WORLD ORDER AGENDA&quot; - the earth must be cleansed of at least 5 billion human beings in order to create their &quot;Utopia&quot;. In 1974, this agenda was outlined in a report called NSSM 200 - and the genocide was to begin in specific 3rd world countries. See <a href="http://www.mathaba." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathaba.</a> net/0_index. shtml?x=90207 However, it is logical that North America (especially Mexico City) would have to be &quot;cleansed&quot; as well. Never forget that both Kissinger and Brezinsky are solid backers of Barack Hussein Obama. Obama makes an official visit to Mexico, and a short week later, Mexico City schools, Universities, and all PUBLIC BUILDINGS are shut down in pandemic fear -- (for the first time since the devastating 1985 earthquake!) Again, is this just a bizarre co-incidence? ?<br/> <br/>SOMETHING WICKED IS NOT COMING, IT IS ALREADY HERE.<br/> <br/>&quot;If I were reincarnated I would wish to be returned to earth as KILLER VIRUS to lower human population levels.&quot;<br/>------ Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, head of the World Wildlife Fund and World FREEMASONRY --- December 1995<br/> <br/>&quot;A 'killer virus' is indeed an evolutionary step-up for some of this planet's so-called &quot;elites&quot; ---- hopefully Prince Phillip, Henry Kissinger, Zbignew Brezinsky, et. al. can each achieve this milestone and not return once again as the mutiganeous- primal-pond- scum life-form they currently occupy today.&quot;<br/>------ Dr. A.

I added bold red emphasis.<br/><br/>********<br/><br/><br/>Do US pandemic plans threaten rights, ACLU asks <br/>14 Jan 2008 18:54:14 GMT <br/>Source: Reuters <br/>By Maggie Fox, Health and Science Editor <br/><br/>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. policy in preparing for a potential bird flu pandemic is veering dangerously toward a heavy-handed law-enforcement approach, the American Civil Liberties Union said on Monday. <br/>The group, which advocates for individuals' legal rights based on the U.S. Constitution, said federal government pandemic plans were confusing and could emphasize a police and military approach to outbreaks of disease, instead of a more sensible public health approach. <br/><br/>&quot;Rather than focusing on well-established measures for protecting the lives and health of Americans, policymakers have recently embraced an approach that views public health policy through the prism of national security and law enforcement,&quot; the ACLU report reads. <br/><br/>But the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HHS) said the group had misunderstood the government's approach and said current plans already incorporate many of the ACLU's recommendations. <br/><br/>Infectious disease experts agree that a pandemic of some sort of influenza is inevitable, and most worries focus on H5N1 avian influenza. Although it mainly attacks birds, the virus has infected 349 people since 2003 and killed 216 of them. <br/><br/>A few mutations could turn it into a highly infectious disease for people and could kill millions globally. <br/><br/>Most countries are working to develop plans to deal with the potential consequences. The U.S. plans are available on Web sites such as <a href="http://pandemicflu.gov." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://pandemicflu.gov.</a> <br/><br/>The ACLU said it was worried that the plan called for military and police involvement in enforcing a quarantine. <br/><br/>The ACLU experts said they were especially disturbed by an October executive order from President George W. Bush that directed HHS to establish a task force to plan for potential catastrophes like a terrorist attack, pandemic influenza or a natural disaster that would ensure full use of Department of Defense resources. <br/><br/>The Bush order does not specify what the Department of Defense role would be, but also mentions military medical research facilities that have played a role in health for decades. <br/><br/>&quot;Pandemic planning today tends to emphasize mandatory vaccination and forced treatment,&quot; the ACLU's Tania Simoncelli told a news conference. <br/><br/>&quot;It also means that sick people are being treated as criminals and enemies of the state rather than individuals in need of care.&quot; <br/><br/>The ACLU said plans should focus on how to help people stay home without losing pay, and instead of merely advising citizens to stockpile food, should provide for ways to help them do so. <br/><br/>HHS spokesman Bill Hall said the government plan stressed community and individual involvement. <br/><br/>&quot;They have mischaracterized our planning efforts. They are confusing a containment attempt as our overall pandemic response once the virus has spread beyond our ability to stop it,&quot; Hall said in a telephone interview. <br/>&quot;Respecting civil liberties has been an important component of our pandemic planning.&quot; <br/><br/>He said many of the recommendations ACLU makes, such as voluntary vaccination and treatment, were in the plan.

Nations from New Zealand to France reported new suspected cases and some warned citizens against travel to North America.<br/><br/>World Health Organization Director-General Margaret Chan held teleconferences with staff and flu experts around the world but stopped short of recommending specific measures to halt the disease beyond urging governments to step up their surveillance of suspicious outbreaks.<br/>Governments including China, Russia and Taiwan began planning to put anyone with symptoms of the deadly virus under quarantine.<br/><br/>Others were increasing their screening of pigs and pork imports from the Americas or banning them outright despite health officials' reassurances that it was safe to eat thoroughly cooked pork.<br/><br/>Some nations issued travel warnings for Mexico and the United States.<br/>Chan called the outbreak a public health emergency of &quot;pandemic potential&quot; because the virus can pass from human to human.<br/><br/>Her agency was considering whether to issue nonbinding recommendations on travel and trade restrictions, and even border closures. It is up to governments to decide whether to follow the advice.<br/><br/>&quot;Countries are encouraged to do anything that they feel would be a precautionary measure,&quot; WHO spokeswoman Aphaluck Bhatiasevi said. &quot;All countries need to enhance their monitoring.&quot;<br/><br/>New Zealand said that 10 students who took a school trip to Mexico &quot;likely&quot; had swine flu. Israel said a man who had recently visited Mexico had been hospitalized while authorities try to determine whether he had the disease. French Health Ministry officials said four possible cases of swine flu are currently under investigation, including a family of three in the northern Nord region and a woman in the Paris region. The four recently returned from Mexico. Tests on two separate cases of suspected swine flu proved negative, they said.<br/><br/>Spain's Health Ministry said three people who just returned from Mexico were under observation in hospitals in the northern Basque region, in southeastern Albacete and the Mediterranean port city of Valencia.<br/>Mexico closed schools, museums, libraries and theaters in a bid to contain the outbreak after hundreds were sickened there. In the U.S., there have been at least 11 confirmed cases of swine flu in California, Texas and Kansas. Patients have ranged in age from 9 to over 50. At least two were hospitalized. All recovered or are recovering.<br/><br/>New York health officials said more than 100 students at the St. Francis Preparatory School, in Queens, recently began suffering a fever, sore throat and aches and pains. Some of their relatives also have been ill.<br/><br/>Some St. Francis students had recently traveled to Mexico, The New York Times and New York Post reported Sunday.<br/><br/>Preliminary tests of samples taken from sick students' noses and throats confirmed that at least eight had a non-human strain of influenza type A, indicating probable cases of swine flu, city health officials said. The exact subtypes were still unknown, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was conducting further tests.<br/><br/>Hong Kong and Taiwan said visitors who came back from flu-affected areas with fevers would be quarantined. China said anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms within two weeks of arrival an affected area had to report to authorities. A Russian health agency said any passenger from North America running a fever would be quarantined until cause of the fever is determined.<br/><br/>Tokyo's Narita airport installed a device to test the temperatures of passengers arriving from Mexico.<br/><br/>Indonesia increased surveillance at all entry points for travelers with flu-like symptoms � using devices at airports that were put in place years ago to monitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and bird flu. It said it was ready to quarantine suspected victims if necessary.<br/><br/>Hong Kong and South Korea warned against travel to the Mexican capital and three affected provinces. Italy, Poland and Venezuela also advised their citizens to postpone travel to affected areas of Mexico and the United States. <br/><br/>Symptoms of the flu-like illness include a fever of more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), body aches, coughing, a sore throat, respiratory congestion and, in some cases, vomiting and diarrhea. <br/><br/>At least 81 people have died from severe pneumonia caused by the disease in Mexico, according to the WHO. <br/><br/>The virus is usually contracted through direct contact with pigs, but Joseph Domenech, chief of animal health service at U.N. Food and Agriculture Agency in Rome, said all indications were that the virus is being spread through human-to-human transmission. <br/><br/>No vaccine specifically protects against swine flu, and it is unclear how much protection current human flu vaccines might offer. <br/><br/>Russia banned the import of meat products from Mexico, California, Texans and Kansas. South Korea said it would increase the number of its influenza virus checks on pork products from Mexico and the U.S. <br/><br/>Serbia on Saturday banned all imports of pork from North America, despite reassurances from the FAO that pigs appear not to be the immediate source of infection. <br/><br/>Italy's agriculture lobby, Coldiretti, warned against panic reaction, noting that farmers lost hundreds of millions of euros (dollars) because of consumers boycotts during the 2001 mad cow scare and the 2005 bird flu outbreak. <br/><br/>Japanese Agriculture Minister Shigeru Ishiba appeared on TV to calm consumers, saying it was safe to eat pork. <br/><br/>In Egypt, health authorities were examining about 350,000 pigs being raised in Cairo and other provinces for swine flu. <br/><br/>The WHO's pandemic alert level is currently at to phase 3. The organization said the level could be raised to phase 4 if the virus shows sustained ability to pass from human to human. <br/><br/>Phase 5 would be reached if the virus is found in at least two countries in the same region. <br/><br/>&quot;The declaration of phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short,&quot; WHO said. <br/>Phase 6 would indicate a full-scale global pandemic. <br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 27, 2009, 5:37am<br/><br/>Post By: &quot;Jacob G.

His administration will also be mindful of the damage to former President George W. Bush over his government's inept handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.<br/><br/>&quot;At this point, a top priority is to ensure that communication is robust and that medical surveillance efforts are fully activated,&quot; John Brennan, assistant to the president for Homeland Security, told a White House briefing.<br/><br/>Dr Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told a separate briefing she feared that some people would die in the United States as the virus spread.<br/><br/>Health and Homeland Security officials announced steps to release some of the U.S. stockpiles of the anti-flu drugs Tamiflu and Relenza. They recommended that local authorities plan for possible school closures and that anyone with symptoms stay at home to reduce the possibility of transmission.<br/><br/>White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said it was too early to say what impact the outbreak could have on efforts to get the economy back on its feet. Spiraling healthcare costs are already a huge drain on the economy.<br/><br/>Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the declaration of the public health emergency was necessary to free federal, state and local agencies' resources and authorize the release of funds to buy more antivirals.<br/><br/>&quot;This is standard operating procedure,&quot; Napolitano stressed, adding that similar declarations had been issued in the past to help states cope with flooding or hurricanes.<br/><br/>CASES MILD<br/><br/>The CDC confirmed 20 cases of swine flu in the United States and said all the patients had recovered and only one person had to be hospitalized. Officials said they were not testing air travelers from Mexico for the virus.<br/><br/>The CDC is preparing a &quot;yellow card&quot; for travelers explaining the flu symptoms and what precautions to take, Schuchat said. U.S. health officials are stressing frequent hand washing as the first line of defense against the virus.<br/><br/>Tests so far show that the H1N1 component of the seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against the new H1N1 swine flu strain, Schuchat said. It could take several months to develop a vaccine for the new virus, she added.<br/><br/>The virus in the U.S. cases appeared to be the same strain as the one that has killed scores in Mexico, CDC acting Director Dr Richard Besser said, although it was not yet clear why it had not proven as deadly in the United States. Health officials from the United States and Canada were now in Mexico to try to answer this &quot;critical question,&quot; he said.<br/><br/>&quot;We expect to see more cases of swine flu. As we continue to look for cases, we expect that we will find them,&quot; Besser said.<br/><br/>Napolitano said the United States would release 25 percent of the 50 million anti-flu drugs from the strategic national stockpile. The Department of Defense has also bought 7 million courses of Tamiflu for defense personnel, she said.<br/><br/>Tamiflu, a pill made by Roche AG ROG.X and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O), and GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK.L) (GSK.N) and Biota's (BTA.AX) Relenza, an inhaled drug, can treat influenza if given quickly. They have been shown to work against this new flu strain.<br/><br/>Gibbs said Obama, who recently returned from a trip to Mexico, had shown no symptoms of the virus and had therefore not been tested.

Furthermore, all TEA Party participants have been filmed and their license plate information taken by all FBI Special Agents in charge at all the rallies. Consider the ramifications...

With DHS having validated the Seek and Destroy Lists, their plans are now being set in motion! Does it not make you furious that men and women in the Armed Forces who have fought all these years for the principles that the Constitutional Republic ONCE Stood for, are now deemed terrorists by the DHS along with Constitutionalists, Christians, gun owners and those who speak out against the foreign destruction of America's economy.

A short time later the number rose to 19, and then 29.<br/><br/><br/>They were found stabbed to death in the trunks of cars, thrown off bridges, or they wrapped their cars around trees after their brake fluid disappeared. Once again, this is the stuff of Hollywood spy stories, and not the way you would expect a microbiologist to give up the ghost.<br/><br/><br/>By 2005, we lost 40 micro-biologists in less than 4 years, all under suspicious circumstances, and during this time someone discovered that they were all working for the government, or government contractors, on projects related to bio-terrorism, flu pandemics, or anthrax. Obviously they weren’t trying to find a cure for anything, or there would be no need to silence them.<br/><br/><br/>Then it was discovered that our government was involved in strange experiments that involve exhuming bodies of people that were killed by the 1918 Spanish flu, and genetically engineered flu viruses, all the while the media is preparing the public with stories of bird flu wiping out thousands of chickens (acid test?) and even a few people here and there.<br/><br/><br/>People who are becoming accustomed to the practices and motives of our criminal government tried to warn you of an impending flu pandemic, but your TV training taught you to dismiss them all as &quot;crazy conspiracy theorists,&quot; and you naturally associated all their warnings with stories of Bigfoot and UFO abductions, just as you were trained to do.<br/><br/><br/>The good folks of FEMA predicted a need for a few million plastic coffins, which are now spread out across the country, but despite this revelation, most of America still thinks their biggest concern is a toss up between the Super Bowl and American Idol.<br/><br/><br/>Well it seems as if the crazy conspiracy theorists were right again, because the world-wide flu pandemic they were warning you about has been unleashed, and it will dominate the headlines until millions, if not billions of people are dead. It won’t be stopped because no one with the means to stop it wants to stop it.<br/><br/><br/>Wash your hands often, pull your kids out of school, avoid crowds, if not people altogether, avoid alcohol or drugs that will weaken your resistance, and stay well-nourished.<br/><br/><br/>Two of the goals here are to cull the population, and to encourage general mayhem and misery that only a World Government can save you from. You’ll be so worn out and tired of death and depression that you’ll offer little resistance to the new order. The economic collapse and World War three are part of the same plan, and it’s all been tried before. It’s the same crew behind this latest attempt, and it’s not difficult to see who’s behind it all, once again.<br/><br/><br/>This flu pandemic that will soon cause people to drop like flies is no mutated bird flu. It’s a genetically engineered virus designed to kill as many people as possible. And after people do start dropping like flies, political dissidents will be accused of being flu carriers and no one will object to them being hauled away.

The next morning, Memphis police found his rental car stopped on a bridge, with a full tank of gas and keys still in the ignition. There was no financial or family trouble. Indeed Wiley was supposed to meet his family at the Memphis airport to continue on to an Icelandic vacation. Neither was there any history of depression or mental illness.<br/><br/><br/>In the report printed in the New York Times on November 27th, the FBI's Memphis office distanced itself from the case saying that the available facts did not add up to a suspicion of foul play. I guess at the FBI it's a perfectly everyday occurrence for a Harvard Professor to stop his rental car on a bridge in the middle of the night before he is supposed to leave for Iceland and just walk away into the Tennessee dark.<br/><br/><br/>The NYT report of November 27th also downplayed Professor Wiley's expertise in virology, quoting Gregory Verdine, a professor of chemical biology at Harvard, said, &quot;If bioterrorists were to abduct Don Wiley, they'd be very disappointed,&quot; because his research was in studying the component parts of viruses, and &quot;that doesn't really help you make a more dangerous version of the virus.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>But this statement is not consistent with the facts of Professor Wiley's full range of knowledge. Wiley has, in conjunction with another Harvard Professor, Dr. Jack Strominger, won several academic prizes for their work in immunology, including a Lasker prize. Don Wiley is a Harvard professor, but he is also a researcher at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the National Institute of Health. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute is located in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and performs biological research, sometimes jointly funded by the Department of Defense and the NIH. Don Wiley's peers at Harvard include professors such as John Collier performing research on Anthrax.<br/><br/><br/>So, contrary to the dismissive tone of the New York Times report, Professor Wiley would be of great value to anyone developing biological weapons. This makes the FBI's obvious disinterest in the case highly questionable, indeed reminiscent of the FBI's obvious disinterest in the numerous witnesses in Oklahoma City who had seen Tim McVeigh in the company of additional perpetrators not to mention the witnesses who had seen additional bombs.<br/><br/><br/>Especially in light of the events of 9/11, the vanishing of a scientist with Professor Wiley's expertise in virology and immunology should have been expected to be an issue of critical national importance, yet the official tone of the government was that this is nothing to worry about. Move along citizen, nothing to see.<br/><br/><br/>In the context of the Anthrax letters being sent through the mail, any disappearance of any microbiologist under questionable circumstances should have set off alarm bells across the nation. but it didn't. Professor Wiley was assumed to have committed suicide, end of story.<br/><br/><br/>The professor's colleagues expressed doubts about the official &quot;suicide&quot; explanation for his disappearance.<br/><br/>Then, more biologists started to die under suspicious circumstances.<br/><br/>The Very Mysterious Deaths of Five Microbiologists.<br/><br/>The body count of infections disease experts continued to climb. Connections to weapons research began to surface.<br/><br/>As many as 14 world-class microbiologists died between 9/11/1 and 3/2/2, and on 6/24/2 yet another microbiologist was added to the list.<br/><br/>Still the US Government acted as if nothing was amiss, as silent on the question of dead microbiologists as they are on the question of the Israeli spies and their connection to 9-11.<br/><br/>In fact, the official silence on the question of how so many top experts in infectious diseases could die in such a short time span is deafening.<br/><br/>Now, statistically, it's possible, even likely, that one or two of these microbiologists legitimately were killed in random accidents. But for so many to die in such a short while exceeds all reasonable bounds of statistics. Prudence would demand an investigation, not the &quot;ho hum&quot; attitude of the government which even today continues to issue dire warnings to the general population of how much we are all in danger from &quot;bioterrorism&quot;.<br/><br/>So, let's take a moment and step away from the perpetual fear-mongering of the media (and Rumsfeld) as they assure us another attack IS coming (with a certainty which suggests inside information on the subject) and assume for a moment that some party has indeed decided to &quot;liquidate&quot; weapons research infectious disease experts.<br/><br/>There is really only one reason to kill off a bunch of scientists. To keep them from doing something they are able to do.<br/><br/>What were these scientists able to do? Maybe blow the whistle if an artificially created disease was about to be used in a manner those who created it did not approve of.<br/><br/>Regardless of the exact reason, there does seem to be a clear pattern of targeted microbiologists, and paired with it, an obvious government disinterest in the matter.<br/><br/>I leave it to you to figure out why.<br/><br/>See also:<br/><br/>Dead Scientists And Microbiologists - Master List<br/><br/>Anthrax and 9/11 - Index of What Really Happened<br/><br/><br/>=============================================================================================================<br/><br/><br/>From: Michelle Sura &lt;michellesura@...&gt;<br/>Date: April 26, 2009 10:50:06 AM GMT-05:00<br/>To: prez President &lt;prez@...&gt;<br/>Subject: Swine Flu/Obama<br/><br/><br/>I have sent you the top link previously, which you reprinted in full.

There is a sense of uncertainty that borders on paranoid behaviour in some cases. At this very moment, Mexican TV is showing how military forces are giving masks to the people in the streets. Moreover the news is sending alarming messages for the audience.

Doctors on the ground say a minimum of 200 are dead. The virus has clearly spread worldwide, including to the UK , via aircraft, carried by an infected crew, with ~220 people on the aircraft having left or made connecting flights, which means the virus will undoubtedly spread across Europe.<br/><br/>It is obvious the virus is incubating all across North America and will break out like wildfire within a week.<br/><br/>What we are witnessing is the release of a biological weapon, designed and funded by our own government � a synthetic recombinant H1N1 virus. Technically speaking, this virus appears to be designed to achieve synapsis with circulating seasonal human H1N1 strains, as well as possibly combine with avian H5N1 strain via homologous recombination. <br/><br/>In plain English, the virus is designed to �upgrade� itself to higher infectivity and virulence, as it circulates over the coming days, weeks, and months. The virus will infect many species, not just humans. It is a crime against mankind of the highest order.<br/><br/>What this means is we have a global pandemic; a lethal one at that. This pandemic is already four to six times as deadly as 1918 � a fatality rate of approximately 8 - 12.5%. Do not forget � this pandemic is ENTIRELY contrived and directed by criminal elements within our own government. I have been repeating for MONTHS that Chicago-based firm Baxter was involved in international biological weapons programs, including the deliberate criminal release of H5N1/H3N2 combined material in Europe, but all I�ve heard are wind chimes.<br/><br/>Now we find , conveniently, that Baxter, based in the 10th District of Chicago, connected with the Chicago criminal den of corruption, will �assist� the World Health Organization in cleaning up the mess � that is , making a new �vaccine�, reaping billions in the process. Why should Baxter be trusted, when they are already under independent criminal investigation in Europe? We already know they are criminally negligant. Now they are a prime suspect in the one of the greatest crimes in the history of mankind.<br/><br/>Talk about the fox guarding the henhouse! This whole thing reeks of criminal corruption and mass genocide, and people should not trust a damned word out of the mouths of the health authorities such as their governments, the CDC, the WHO, or their minions at Baxter and myriad of other firms involved with biological weapons.<br/><br/>For those interested in prosecuting those involved in creating the virus, look no further than the US Army Institute of Molecular Pathology and the work of Dr. Taudenberger between 1997-2003, funded by Price Waterhouse Coopers, who made quarterly reports to AIPAC on his lab�s progress of assembling highly lethal, _synthetic_ H1N1 and H5N1 recombinants, after digging up deceased miners from 1918 buried in the Alaskan permafrost.<br/><br/>On to the therapy:<br/><br/>=======================<br/><br/>In order of importance.

Cold comfort <br/>By Katherine Heerbrandt <br/>22 Apr 2009 <br/>The Criminal Investigation Division at Fort Meade has been investigating USAMRIID at Fort Detrick since at least early February. Meade's CID pursues investigations of serious crimes and sensitive subjects of concern to the Army at regional bases like Detrick, which has no internal investigative arm. A News-Post story in February reported that USAMRIID was shutting down most of its bioresearch while it tried to match its inventory to its records, citing an &quot;overage&quot; of BSAT, biological select agents and toxins. Meade's CID, however, isn't concerned with overstock. Instead, agents are looking for what may have gone missing between 1987 and 2008. <br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 27, 2009, 6:32am<br/><br/>Fw: Sustained Human Transmission of Swine H1N1 in California<br/><br/><br/><br/>From: Commonground <br/>Sent: Friday, April 24, 2009 1:47 AM<br/>Subject: Sustained Human Transmission of Swine H1N1 in California<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Commentary<br/><br/>Sustained Human Transmission of Swine H1N1 in California<br/>Recombinomics Commentary 21:30<br/>April 23, 2009<br/><br/><br/>it is reassuring that international reporting has been rapid, there vigorous case finding is underway and that apart from some history of possible upper respiratory infections there is no indication of sustained human-to-human transmission or widespread infection of contacts of the two ill patients<br/><br/>The above comments by the European Centere for Disease Control and Prevention on the confirmed H1N1 swine flu in southern California ignore the glaring indication of sustained human-to-human transmission, which is the distance between the two confirmed cases (see updated map).<br/><br/>There was no direct connection with swine or each other, so the confirmation of the same virus at distant locations was the indication, because both clusters were almost certainly caused by transmission from other humans.<br/><br/>Moreover, each confirmed case was linked to family members who developed symptoms before and after the confirmed case, supporting transmission within the family. However, because the symptoms were mild, none of the family members sought medical attention and were not tested.<br/><br/>Thus, the lack of evidence is simply due to the lack of testing, not the lack of transmission.<br/><br/>Yesterday there were reports of suspect cases in the Imperial Valley.

Up to 60 deaths may have already occurred from the new viral strain called H1N1. Over 1,000 people may have been infected. The CDC does not really know how many are infected, as it's still very early in the spread of the viral strain and reliable data isn't yet available.<br/><br/>Importantly, just as I warned NaturalNews readers many times over the last several years, there is no vaccine for this swine flu. Vaccines are virtually useless in any pandemic outbreak because in-the-wild viral strains mutate and become immune to vaccines very quickly. Subscribers who listened to my preparedness audio course released in late 2008 are already prepared with herbal anti-viral medicines, well ahead of the rush: <a href="http://www.truthpub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthpub</a> lishing.com/ Heal...<br/><br/>Is this viral outbreak the &quot;big one&quot; that will become a global pandemic? No one knows for sure, but important clues are found in the geographic locations of the current infections: Mexico City, San Diego and San Antonio, Texas. This indicates the virus is already beyond containment and is likely to spread even further. &quot;There are things that we see that suggest that containment is not very likely,&quot; said Dr. Richard Besser from the CDC, in a Reuters report (source below).<br/><br/>The World Health Organization, meanwhile, issued a statement saying &quot;Because there are human cases associated with an animal influenza virus, and because of the geographical spread of multiple community outbreaks, plus the somewhat unusual age groups affected, these events are of high concern.&quot;<br/><br/>The WHO admits the new virus is already resistant to amantadine and rimantadine (two popular anti-viral drugs), but appears to be sensitive to Tamiflu (at least for the moment). Health care workers in Mexico have already been infected by the H1N1 virus, reports the CBC (Canada).<br/><br/>&quot;We have determined that this virus is contagious and is spreading from human to human,&quot; says the CDC on their web site (http://www.cdc. gov/flu/swine/ invest...). But they don't know exactly how contagious the disease really is, or what the fatality rate might be. U.S. residents who were infected have recovered, while many infected people in Mexico have died. It is not yet clear why there is a difference in the survival rate across these two countries.<br/><br/>Notably, the CDC website does NOT report infections unless they are confirmed by CDC laboratories. Thus, the infection numbers on their website (currently showing only 8 cases in the U.S. and 7 in Mexico) are extremely low and do not accurately reflect the real number of infections occurring on the streets. (See link below.)<br/><br/><font color="Yellow">Symptoms of H1N1 infection include fever, sore throat, muscle pain, coughing and shortness of breath. This can escalate into serious respiratory illness with difficulty breathing and, ultimately, death.</font><br/><br/>None of the people infected have had contact with swine or birds, according to news reports. This is a clear indication that the disease is being transmitted from human to human. <br/>How to make a pandemic even worse<br/>In an effort to stem public panic, Mexico is reportedly launching a massive vaccination campaign. This is all theater, of course, since there are no vaccines that target this new H1N1 strain. If anything, the vaccines will actually weaken immune systems, making people more susceptible to H1N1 infection. Thus, Mexico may actually be fanning the flames of this potential pandemic strain.<br/><br/>It is sad, but predictable, to watch so-called health authorities blunder through the mishandling of this potential future pandemic. Rather than teaching people how to be healthy (recommending sunlight, for example, which produces a very powerful anti-viral vitamin in your body), they focus on how to inject people and weaken their immune systems. If a pandemic actually does emerge from this, and if millions die from it, their deaths will rest entirely on the shoulders of a failed, arrogant and utterly useless medical system that still believes it can conquer nature with chemicals.<br/><br/>I wrote a book two years ago that teaches people how to protect themselves from not only avian flu, but also from the dangerous mistakes of conventional medicine (hospitals could become &quot;death zones&quot; if this pandemic grows).

The three amigos, Bush, Harper and Calderon, finalized and released the &quot;North American Plan for Avian & Pandemic Influenza.&quot; <br/><br/>The &quot;Plan&quot; (that's what they call it, with a capital P) is to use the excuse of a major flu epidemic to shift powers from U.S. legislatures to unelected, unaccountable &quot;North American&quot; bureaucrats. <br/><br/>This idea was launched on September 14, 2005 when Bush announced the &quot;International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza.&quot; He was then speaking to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. <br/><br/>We might have thought that idea had some merit because the Influenza Partnership called for &quot;transparency in reporting of influenza cases in humans and in animals&quot; and the &quot;sharing of epidemiological data and samples.&quot; That's very different from the SPP, where transparency has always been conspicuously avoided like the plague. <br/><br/>This year's SPP summit in Canada morphed the Influenza Partnership into the North American Plan. Now we discover that the Plan is not only about combating a flu epidemic but is far-reaching in seeking control over U.S. citizens and public policy during an epidemic. <br/><br/>The Plan repeatedly features the favorite Bush word &quot;comprehensive&quot;; it calls for a &quot;comprehensive, coordinated North American approach.&quot; The Plan would give authority to international bureaucrats &quot;beyond the health sector to include a coordinated approach to critical infrastructure protection,&quot; including &quot;border and transportation issues.&quot; <br/><br/>The Plan is a wordy 44-page document, much of which sounds innocuous. It is helpful to exchange information about disease and take precautions against letting foreign diseases enter the United States. <br/><br/>However, self-government and sovereignty are at risk when control over these matters is turned over to a newly created North American body headed by the representative of another country. It's an additional problem when the entire Plan is a spin-off of the Security and Prosperity Partnership, an arrangement created in secret solely by White House press releases, without Congressional approval or even oversight. <br/><br/>The 2007 Plan acknowledges that it is based not only on the Influenza Partnership, but also on the guidelines, standards and rules of the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). <br/><br/>The Plan sets up a &quot;senior level Coordinating Body to facilitate the effective planning and preparedness within North America for a possible outbreak of avian and/or human pandemic influenza under the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP).&quot; The Plan identifies this SPP Coordinating Body as &quot;decision-makers.&quot; <br/><br/>The Plan then (ungrammatically) states: &quot;The chair of the SPP Coordinating Body will rotate between each national authority on a yearly basis.&quot; A foreigner will be the &quot;decision-maker&quot; for Americans in two out of every three years. <br/><br/>What powers will this foreign-headed Coordinating Body exercise? The Plan suggests that these include &quot;the use of antivirals and vaccines; . . . social distancing measures, including school closures and the prohibition of community gatherings; . . . isolation and quarantine.&quot; <br/><br/>Will this foreign-headed Coordinating Body respect the First Amendment &quot;right of the people peaceably to assemble&quot;? Or will the rules of the Plan, SPP, WHO, OIE, WTO, and NAFTA take precedence? <br/><br/>In evaluating the Plan, it is instructive to recall the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (EHPA), an anti-epidemic plan launched by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on October 23, 2001. Designed to be passed by all state legislatures, the model bill was primarily written by Lawrence O. Gostin, a former member of Hillary Clinton's discredited Task Force on Health Care Reform, and was promoted by the Bush Administration during its first year. <br/><br/>The proposed EHPA would have given each governor sole discretion to declare a public health emergency and grant himself extraordinary powers. He would have been able to restrict or prohibit firearms, seize private property and destroy it in many circumstances, and impose price controls and rationing. <br/><br/>Governors would have been given the power to order people out of their homes and into dangerous quarantines. Children could have been taken from their parents and put into public quarantines. <br/><br/>Governors could even have demanded that physicians administer certain drugs despite individuals' religious or other objections. EHPA was based on the undemocratic concept that decision-making by authoritarian bosses and unelected bureaucrats is the way to go in time of crisis. <br/><br/>EHPA roused a nationwide storm of protest because it was an unprecedented assault on the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens, as well as on our principles of limited government, and so it never passed anywhere in its original text. Will similar totalitarian notions now bypass legislatures and be forced upon us by SPP press releases? <br/><br/>Google Ads are provided by Google and are not selected or endorsed by Eagle Forum<br/><br/><br/><b>Bush Refuses to Deny the NAU  </b><br/><br/>The three-nation summit at Montebello, Quebec, was held behind closed doors, well guarded behind an intimidating fence and plenty of police, but the news conference that followed on August 21 revealed more than the three heads of state had planned. President George W. Bush, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and Mexican President Felipe Calderon all refused to deny that the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) is a stepping stone toward a North American Union. <br/><br/>The $64,000 question was posed by a Fox News reporter, Bret Baier. He asked all three heads of state, &quot;Can you say today that this is not a prelude to a North American Union, similar to a European Union?&quot; <br/><br/>Their response was positively sensational. None of the three denied that SPP is leading to a North American Union (NAU). The White House transcript of the news conference allows us to assume that the elites of the three countries are, indeed, moving toward North American integration. <br/><br/>Bush insulted the questioner and those who want an answer by accusing them of believing in a &quot;conspiracy.&quot; Bush twice said he was &quot;amused&quot; by such speculation, but as Queen Victoria famously said, &quot;We are not amused.&quot; <br/><br/>Instead of addressing the crux of the question about plans to integrate the three North American countries, Bush resorted to ridicule. He sneered at his critics as &quot;comical,&quot; and accused them of engaging in &quot;political scare tactics&quot; and wanting &quot;to frighten our fellow citizens into believing that relations between us are harmful for our respective peoples.&quot; <br/><br/>Harper tried to trivialize the Montebello summit. He implied that the SPP meeting was merely about harmonizing different regulations on &quot;jelly beans.&quot; Apparently, a Canadian jelly bean manufacturer had demanded standardization of the rules so his company would not have to produce different jelly beans for the United States, which bans a red dye permitted in Canada. Nobody asked: If that's all SPP is about, why such secrecy, and does SPP harmonization mean we must allow food imports using dyes we believe are dangerous? <br/><br/>Harper made everybody laugh when he accused his opponents of speculating that a NAFTA superhighway might go &quot;interplanetary.&quot; Harper twice pleaded that SPP was merely a deal he inherited from his predecessor, Paul Martin, the Canadian Prime Minister who participated in the first SPP summit with Bush at Waco in 2005. <br/><br/>Calderon chimed in to brush off what he called &quot;jovial&quot; and &quot;funnier&quot; SPP &quot;myths.&quot; Surprise, surprise, he concentrated on demanding that we reduce &quot;barriers between ourselves&quot; and put &quot;more investment&quot; (i.e., U.S. dollars) in Mexico. <br/><br/>Bush also failed to deny, and left hanging, two other parts of the Fox News reporter's well-crafted question: &quot;Are there plans to build some kind of superhighway connecting all three countries?&quot; and what about the &quot;lack of transparency from this partnership?&quot; <br/>Bush couldn't with a straight face deny superhighway plans because Texas has already signed a contract with a Spanish company to build a limited-access, 10-lane toll-road from Mexico to Oklahoma. It obviously will not dead-end at the Oklahoma border. <br/><br/>Nor could Bush deny the offensive lack of transparency, which excludes both Congress and the public from all SPP plans. Congress doesn't like to be ignored: 21 Republicans and one freshman Democrat recently sent a joint letter to Bush voicing &quot;serious and growing concerns&quot; and urging him not to &quot;agree to any further movement in connection with the SPP.&quot; <br/>The House further manifested its annoyance at the lack of transparency by overwhelmingly (362 to 63) adopting Rep. Duncan Hunter's (R-CA) amendment to prohibit the use of federal funds to pay for SPP working groups or to create NAFTA superhighways. <br/><br/>Bush pleaded that he believes in &quot;trade,&quot; &quot;dialogue,&quot; and &quot;working with our neighbors&quot; to &quot;work out common problems.&quot; So do we all. <br/><br/>U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Wilkins supported his boss with an interview in an Ottawa newspaper. He ridiculed &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and used another cheap debating tactic: setting up a straw man that is easy to knock down. Wilkins implied that the purpose of the three-amigo summit in Montebello was to prevent potential threats &quot;like those posed by pandemic flu or improperly labeled foods, for example, from penetrating our borders.&quot; <br/><br/>However, the current threats from pandemic flu and improperly labeled foods come from China, not Canada. The biggest North American threat of &quot;penetrating our borders&quot; comes from people, i.e., illegal aliens. <br/><br/>Google Ads are provided by Google and are not selected or endorsed by Eagle Forum<br/><br/><br/><b>Economic Integration: Mexican Trucks </b><br/><br/>On September 6 at 9 p.m., the Bush Administration opened up all U.S. highways and roads to Mexican trucks and drivers. That gave the green light to the first 38 of up to 100 Mexican trucking companies, and nobody knows how many thousands of Mexican trucks will eventually drive on our roads. <br/><br/>Bush thus thumbed his nose at the U.S. House, which voted overwhelmingly and bipartisanly (411 to 3) on May 15 for Rep. Duncan Hunter's (R-CA) amendment to exclude Mexican trucks, and again on July 24 (by voice vote) for Rep. Nancy Boyda's (D-KS) amendment, to prohibit the entry of Mexican trucks. The U.S. Senate voted 75-23 on September 11 for Sen. Byron Dorgan's (D-ND) amendment to exclude Mexican trucks. <br/><br/>For 25 years, Mexican trucks had been restricted to a commercial zone of about 25 miles in the United States, where their loads were transferred to U.S. trucks. Bill Clinton, bless him, kept this restriction in place. <br/><br/>U.S. law (since 1971) requires that commercial drivers be able to &quot;read and speak the English language sufficiently to converse with the general public, to understand highway traffic signs and signals in the English language, to respond to official inquiries, and to make entries on reports and records.&quot; <br/><br/>It is not believable that the Bush Administration will test the language skills of the thousands of Mexican drivers crossing our border. Mexican drivers unfamiliar with our roads and signage, plus language incompatibility, will be a danger to all driving Americans. <br/><br/>We have no way of knowing if Mexican drivers are criminals or terrorists or drug peddlers or accident-prone since Mexico doesn't have nationwide criminal or driving-record databases. The professional Mexican drug smuggler who testified against U.S. Border Patrol agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean was a legally licensed Mexican commercial truck driver. U.S. drivers are limited to ten consecutive hours of service, but Mexican drivers typically drive up to 20 hours a day. Even if Mexican drivers are now limited to 10 hours per day, nobody knows how many hours they are behind the wheel before reaching the border. <br/><br/>Big corporations are eager to have their made-in-Mexico-or-China-by-cheap-labor products delivered in the United States by Mexican drivers because they are paid 33% to 40% less than U.S. truckers. <br/><br/>Only one or two percent of trucks coming across the border are inspected. The smugglers of illegal drugs, products and people can just consider it a cost of doing business that so few illegal loads will be caught. <br/><br/>The problem is not only the increased wear and tear on our highways that U.S. taxpayers will subsidize, and not only the crowding of our roads that will make driving less pleasant, but it's our worry about safety. Anyone who does much driving on our highways knows how crowded with big trucks our highways already are. <br/><br/><b>Where Is the Fence? </b><br/><br/>On October 26, 2006, shortly before the national election, President Bush called in reporters for a very special photo-op. He posed for the television cameras as he signed the Secure Fence Act, which ordered the government to build an 854-mile fence along our southern border. This was and is a very popular law. It passed the U.S. House by an overwhelming (283-138) vote, and passed the Senate by a remarkable 80-19 vote. <br/><br/>After a year, the Bush Administration has built only about 18 miles of the required double fence. <br/><br/>This failure � or refusal � to obey the law leads the American people to believe that Bush and Michael Chertoff do not intend to build the fence, and is a prime example of why the American people don't trust our government. The government could hire eight construction firms to simultaneously build 100 miles of the fence and offer a bonus for the company that first completes its hundred miles. <br/><br/>The only rational explanation of Bush's stubborn determination to override the wishes of the American people by opening up all our roads to Mexican trucks is that this is an essential part of his plan for the economic integration of the United States with Mexico and Canada. The only rational explanation of Bush's refusal to build the fence is that he has no intention of stopping the flow of illegal aliens across our southern border. <br/><br/><b>Sink the Law of the Sea Again </b><br/><br/>With all the critical problems facing America today, it's hard to see why President Bush is wasting whatever is left of his presidential clout to partner with Democratic presidential candidate Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) to try to get the Senate to ratify the United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST). <br/><br/>LOST is the globalists' dream bill. It would put the United States in a de facto world government that rules all the world's oceans under the pretense that they belong to &quot;the common heritage of mankind.&quot; That's global-speak for allowing the United Nations and its affiliated organizations to carry out a massive, unprecedented redistribution of wealth from the United States to other countries. <br/><br/>LOST has already been ratified by 155 countries. Most of them no doubt expect corrupt UN bureaucrats to divvy up the riches at the bottom of the sea, which will be brought to the surface by American investment and technology, and parcel them out to Third World dictators to support themselves in the lavish style to which they would like to become accustomed. <br/><br/>Why must we who believe in American sovereignty have to keep fighting the same battles over and over again? President Ronald Reagan rejected LOST back in 1982, not because of picky details in the text, but because LOST would put the United States in the clutches of a supranational ruling clique. <br/><br/>The argument is being made that Reagan's objections were &quot;fixed&quot; in 1994. That's a sham because no one country can legally change the terms of a treaty that has already been signed and ratified by over a hundred countries, and 25 countries have not agreed to the 1994 changes anyway. Furthermore, changing a few details of the treaty does nothing to address the massive loss of U.S. sovereignty which Reagan and grassroots Americans found impudent and obnoxious. <br/><br/>LOST has already created the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and given it total jurisdiction over all the oceans and everything in them, including &quot;solid, liquid or gaseous mineral resources.&quot; LOST even gives the ISA something the UN bureaucrats have lusted after for years: the authority to impose international taxes (disguised by euphemisms such as fees and royalties). <br/><br/>LOST would subject our governmental, military and business operations to mandatory dispute resolution by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg, Germany. If you think activist judges in the United States are out of control, wait till you try your case before this UN tribunal, whose decisions cannot be appealed. <br/><br/>Since several U.S. Supreme Court justices are on record as using, and urging others to use, foreign law in deciding U.S. cases, LOST would be an open invitation to our activist judges to interpret LOST's purposely vague provisions. Liberal U.S. judges might even develop the theory that LOST is &quot;evolving&quot; (like liberal notions about the U.S. Constitution), so that liberal social and especially environmental biases could be written into our laws. <br/><br/>All LOST agencies are United Nations organizations, and the UN Secretary General plays an important role in administering the treaty. With the UN's shocking track record of corruption, it makes no sense to give it a new infusion of power and money. <br/><br/>The Bush Administration argues that we need LOST to protect our interests in the world's oceans and to assure that our Navy can go where it needs to go. The problem with that argument is that if we join LOST, we will be bound to abide by its decisions. <br/><br/>One of the silliest arguments is that we need LOST to protect us against Russia's claim to the North Pole and its oil riches. If we ratify LOST, we would have to accept the LOST Tribunal's decision. Even though the United States already has valid claims to the North Pole region under the Doctrine of Discovery, the chances of the LOST bureaucrats ruling for us against Russia are about 1 in 155. <br/><br/>The best protection for U.S. interests in the world's oceans is the U.S. Navy, which should not and must not be subject to orders or regulations made by paper pushers in the ISA or rulings of the International Tribunal. U.S. access to the high seas, as well as freedom of the seas for all countries, is best protected by a great U.S. Navy, not a UN bureaucracy financed by a global tax. <br/><br/><b>We Must Defend American Sovereignty  </b><br/><br/>The attempt to force economic integration of the three North American countries and to make the United States subject to international organizations is moving so rapidly that it has become a clear and present threat to the continued sovereignty and even independence of our beloved country. <br/><br/>The globalists run away from the term North American Union, but they are very frank in calling their goal &quot;economic integration&quot; and &quot;labor mobility&quot; among the three North American countries. That means open borders for cheap labor. The model for economic integration is the European Union, which started out as just a common market and eventually eliminated national sovereignty with a supra-national government making all policies in Brussels and deciding all disputes in Luxembourg. <br/><br/>This North American economic integration is progressing rapidly � Bush giving Mexican trucks access to all our highways and roads (even though both Houses of Congress voted overwhelming against this), the NAFTA Superhighway (for which the Texas portion has already been contracted with a Spanish company), Bush's Totalization plan to put illegal aliens in Social Security, the changes in our law about Patents to benefit foreign countries, the continued demand for amnesty, guest workers, and H-1B visas, the trade agreements that pretend to promote free trade but actually are a cover for outsourcing of good American jobs, and, of course, public school curricula that teach our youngsters they should be citizens of the world. <br/><br/>The globalists run away from the term world government, but they are very frank in calling their goal global governance - and that means decisions made by foreign bureaucrats and judges in organizations where the United States has one out of 150 votes. Global governance is progressing rapidly by means of United Nations and &quot;free trade&quot; treaties and agreements. All UN treaties mean a loss of our sovereignty, especially the UN Law of the Sea Treaty, the UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child, and the UN Treaty on Women (known as CEDAW). <br/><br/>The model for replacing national sovereignty with rule by treaties is the European Union. The European Union constitution was rejected by the voters in two countries, so the elite are forcing it on the people by treaties. <br/><br/>The defense of our sovereignty and independence demands action by Americans now � before it's too late. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Further reading: <br/> Law of the Sea Treaty <br/> Mexican Trucks <br/> Immigration <br/><br/>Order extra copies of this report online!<br/>Back Copies of Phyllis Schlafly Reports:   NATIONAL DEFENSE <br/><br/><br/>Google Ads are provided by Google and are not selected or endorsed by Eagle Forum<br/><br/>Eagle Forum � PO Box 618 � Alton, IL 62002 � phone: 618-462-5415 � fax: 618-462-8909 � eagle@eagleforum.org<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Apr 27, 2009, 2:34pm<br/><br/><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1173672/Obamas-swine-flu-scare-shaking-hands-archaeologist-died-24-hours-later.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnew....ours-later.html</a><br/><br/>Obama's swine flu scare after shaking hands with archaeologist who died 24 hours later<br/>By David Gardner<br/>Last updated at 1:39 PM on 27th April 2009<br/><br/>A man who shook Barack Obama's hand in Mexico died the next day from symptoms similar to those of swine flu. <br/><br/>The White House insisted the President's health was not in any danger, but he was said to be taking the threat of an epidemic 'very seriously'. <br/><br/>The President's health advisers were already concerned about his visit south of the border after learning the contagious virus first struck in Mexico City on April 13 - three days before Mr Obama flew in to meet government officials.<br/><br/>Their alarm grew after learning that Felipe Solis, director of the National Anthropology Museum, had died from pneumonia. <br/><br/>Mr Solis had taken Mr Obama on a tour of the museum on April 16, a week before his death. <br/><br/>Mexican health boss Jose Cordova, however, said Mr Solis was already ill and his death was unrelated to swine flu. <br/>White House spokesman Robert Gibbs insisted: �The president�s trip to Mexico has not put his health in any danger.� <br/><br/>He added: �The incubation period is 24 to 48 hours and we have been back from Mexico for nine days now. The doctors say he was not at risk.� <br/><br/>Mr Obama was in Mexico for less than a day before heading to a �Summit of the Americas� in Trinidad and Tobago<br/><br/>Mr Obama took some flak for playing golf on Sunday, but Mr Gibbs said he was being updated regularly on the outbreak by the State Department and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention.<br/><br/>The virus is said to have infected twelve people in Kansas, California, Ohio and Texas and sickened at least another eight students in New York.<br/><br/> Patients cover their mouths while waiting at the Mexican Social Security hospital today<br/><br/>Speaking at a White House briefing last night, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said a �stockpile� of anti-viral drugs was being released to help keep the disease at bay.<br/><br/>Announcing a state of emergency, she said border security would be increased with visitors being quizzed over possible swine flu symptoms.<br/><br/>Worried about a possible impact on the farming industry, she emphasised: �I want to underscore that you can�t get swine flu from eating pork.� <br/><br/>�The president is very concerned about the recent cases of swine flu,� added presidential assistant John Brennan.<br/><br/>He said Mr Obama was offering his �full support� to Mexico efforts to control the disease.<br/><br/>�The U.S. government is working to �mitigate a broader outbreak in the United States.� <br/><br/>Dr Richard Besser, acting director of the Centre for Disease Control, urged Americans to improve hygiene by washing hands more regularly and staying at home if they fell sick.<br/><br/>�We expect to see more cases of swine flu,� he said, adding that work was under way to identify and produce a vaccine.<br/><br/>Of the U.S. swine flu patients, only one needed hospital treatment and none of those infected were seriously ill.<br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on May 3, 2009, 3:31pm<br/><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ugVlI_CEpWg&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ugVlI_CEpWg&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on May 3, 2009, 3:33pm<br/><br/><object width="350" height="287"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/77uE7WE6Grk&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/77uE7WE6Grk&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="350" height="287"></embed></object><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on May 20, 2009, 7:27am<br/><br/><a href="http://w700.photobucket.com/albums/ww10/CompassMorainn/?action=view&current=fd31fc46.pbw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://s700.photobucket.com/albums/ww10/CompassMorainn/th_Sci-Fi-Women-46688.jpg" alt="[image] " title="[image] " border="0"/></a><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on May 21, 2009, 2:04am<br/><br/><font size="3">An Invitation To Compass Morainn </font><br/><br/>When we talk about Exopolitics, we speak mostly of events or information about the mirad forms of extra-terrestrial contact. Rarely do we focus upon the individuals who bring us the events or information. These individuals come from a wide range of backgrounds some such as Contactees and Abductees from the public sector. Others such as Whistleblowers and sanctioned military or corporate releasers, step only far enough from the shadows to give indication that they exist but little more.<br/><br/>These varied individuals rarely come forward alone. Often they request assistence from researchers within the fields of exopolitics, ufology, conspiracy, and the many more formal sciences to reach out to the public world where the gift of the unknown can bear a heavy personal toll. The researchers and other service providers who interconnect with them are Exopolitical Mediators. They bridge the gaps between the functional daylight and the shadows of our reality. Working as a neutral third party, the exopolitical mediator assists one or more participants to reach out in a variety of ways amidst an uninformed public.<br/><br/>In an ever increasing disclosure oriented environment, this service has become crucial to the lives of many Contact experiencers. It gives them the ability to maintain their dignity and autonomy and provides a voice in the events, experiences, and interactions impacting not only their own lives but the broader global spectrum of the Contact Paradigm encompassing the peoples of Earth.<br/><br/>For over sixty years practicing exopolitical mediators have functioned alone, independently, rarely ever connecting with others in the same field for they were few and far between. Today with the explosion of the Exopolitical field of study, their ranks have swelled around the world. Yet still they have not had a network to call their own or resources to assist them in providing the service to humanity which they have taken unto themselves as their personal calling.<br/><br/>Today I would like to introduce you to the debut of that network. Compass Morainn is an association of Exopolitical Mediators, working to establish and improve this newly organizing field of service called Exopolitical Mediation, within the collaborative fields of Exopolitics, Sociology, Cultural-Anthropology, Psychology, History, Medicine, and Law. <br/><br/>Their home website is:  <a href="http://compassmorainn.webs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://compassmorainn.webs.com/</a><br/><br/>Other sites include the Journal:  <a href="http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/</a><br/><br/>And the Members Forum:  <a href="http://compassmorainn.proboards.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://compassmorainn.proboards.com/</a><br/><br/>It is a new tool for exopolitical mediators with information pertinent to their trade, trade news, a member forum, website translation, and soon a dedicated database and blog for members publications on the subject.

A mediator seeks understanding rather than development of an opinion which results in judgment. This ability to be and remain neutral is incredibly important for success in traditional mediation. Rachel Fishman Green, Esq., describes the benefits of neutrality in the following way, �If I really understand how you are feeling, what this experience has done to you, what this means for you, the challenges that you are facing as you try to restructure your life � then I can help (others) understand these things. And I can also make sure that (what) we put together takes care of you and your needs.�<br/><br/>The same is applicable to Exopolitical Mediation. The participant or group and the inter-lying public which the Exopolitical Mediator works with has needs, hopes, and expectations just as participants in traditional mediation do. The human equation is no different in this respect and does indeed demand a voice to be heard and received seriously. The act of experiencing mediation is very powerful and can facilitate not only understanding but also changes to peoples goals and outlooks. This lays a tremendous burden of responsibility upon the Mediator to maintain a position of holistic caring service which is created when a mediator maintains neutrality.<br/><br/>Every individual experiences life from a perspective. That perspective will be a consequence of their knowledge, their experiences, their health, and their maturity. No other person is more appropriate to speak about their lives or their needs than themselves. In the Contact Paradigm the ability to communicate and be treated with dignity and respect is severely hampered by many layers of confusion, fears, illegitimate ridicule, inadequate knowledge and experience as well as the human tendency to compete or dominate. Mediation gives the opportunity for all voices to approach the human collective consciousness and be heard fairly in our reality.<br/><br/>An Exopolitical Mediator in remaining neutral does not judge and does their best to listen to everything that a participant or group has to say. The Mediator will ask questions to garner the best understanding of the information that he/she can. And the Mediator will assist in brainstorming to figure out how best to achieve a person's or group's needs. An Exopolitical Mediator will use all of the tools at their disposal to make sure that each party involved in the mediation HEARS the other.<br/><br/>One of the valuable skills a Mediator can apply is evaluating the communication of a participant to encourage improvements or additions which help prevent miscommunication. In Exopolitics the distance between the participant and the public audience, if that is the end recipient or alternate party in the mediation, can issue misconceptions or misconstrue the information or intents involved. The Mediator works to alleviate this known difficulty through experience & scope of paradigm awareness. Here again mediator neutrality comes into play, allowing the Mediator great flexibility of perception themselves.<br/><br/>A neutral mediator helps to improve communication by helping all parties or participants involved to understand where the other(s) are coming from. No party involved has to agree with the other(s) but it helps to understand why you disagree or where or why differences exist.<br/><br/>Mediators often feel great empathy for the participants. They not only perceive needs but they also perceive the emotions, challenges, and strength of personal investment involved in the participant's experiences, information, and existential position. The Mediator's job is to utilize this depth of their own perception to help all parties increase their understanding of each other and then to facilitate the best way for them to communicate or interact effectively. His or her greatest challenge is to understand everyone involved.<br/><br/>And the ultimate goal is the honest and honorable exchange of Truth.<br/><br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on May 21, 2009, 2:12am<br/><br/><a href="http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/2009/05/regarding-control-influence-excellence.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/2009/....excellence.html</a><br/><br/><font size="3">Regarding Control, Influence, & Excellence; Pertinent Information for Exopolitical Mediators </font><br/>by Cyrellys Geibhendach<br/>Friday, May 15, 2009<br/><br/>I am going to wax more philosophical for a moment to deep the external and personal context within which Exopolitical Mediators operate. This examines the effect of human control and human influence and their contributional values. So to does it delve into the philosophy of the pursuit of excellence and how the concepts of control and influence are regarded.<br/><br/>Our control in this life, I think is limited in many ways but our Influence is not. If we continue on a chosen ethical path then we will remain limited in our control for quite sometime in many respects, because the honoring of Free Will is a part of being ethical. But as we, the human race, progress in our existential explorations we will come to realize that the long-term benefits of ethical choices gives us exponential leaps in Influence. We cannot force anyone human or otherwise to believe or fully understand something....but we can Influence them to be self-empowered to progress in their own way.<br/><br/>As our Influential ability grows it reverberates throughout our own people bringing a potential toward briliance of self...this is the positive outcome of chosing ethical paths...it far outweighs and out-distances any usefulness of control. One day such a chosen path and skill of Influence could extend to create ourselves into an Influential Example for other races who may at that point be asking many of the same questions we ask about ourselves and extra-terrestrial races today....but we have to invest in our own self improvement first...this process of experiencing, learning and sharing is part of respecting Excellence in Life.<br/><br/>Why do some humans have a negative view of the world and everything which goes with it? Where does this dispondency come from? I think that is because humanity's moments of weakness have encompassed some individuals and groups more than others....their negative views are a consequence of the Human Race's areas of self neglect and therefore are self inflicted...as well as being a self-perpetuating consequence on an individual level once it has occured thus becoming a vicious cycle. Can this be changed? Certainly. But like anything worth doing it takes sometimes a great deal of effort and consistency.<br/><br/>I don't believe humans are more negative than positive....it think the perception of that is based solely on personal experience and just as dandilions will group in various and particular areas of a yard, so too does positive and negative natures...sometimes it is luck of the draw as to what we routinely encounter...sometimes it is an innate human need to address deep personal or spiritual issues and then work through them which brings us in contact once or repetatively with negativity. We don't yet conceptualize this clearly and firmly where we may then teach it to the next generations in order that they might better understand or percieve what themes they are involved in or why they manifest around or within our individual life circle.<br/><br/>This matter of what we teach of our Knowledge to the future generations and even the current ones is very much a subject of concern to the Exopolitical Mediator....from my own perspective and history, my ancestors both ancient and recent have always regarded Knowledge as sacred. So too is the possession of it a sacred trust. This sacred trust doesn't mean that Knowledge was intended to be kept sequestered among the priviledged few. It was once regarded that the Knowledge of our Race was a trust given to us by the &quot;Gods&quot; or &quot;Ancients&quot; and that to fail to teach it or pass it from generation to generation was a severe crime. There are three kinds of Knowledge: the Nature of each thing, the Cause of each thing, and the Influence of each thing. To seek to aquire knowledge of all things which is in its pure form, the effort to Understand, is a great part of respecting and pursuing Excellence. The other part of that is sharing the knowledge and wisdom earned.<br/><br/>Maturity comes from within...it is the assimilation of knowledge and its practical, ethical application by a person practicing Virtue and then its evolution and manifestation as Wisdom. To practice Virtue is to honor the rule of law, to be honest, and to be proud. Pride in this context is not an ill expressed behavior of dominance, instead it is both a depth of understanding of self worth, and also a confidence in self, which is then expressed in honorable character. When an individual can value one's self then so to are they then equipped to find the inherent truth and value in others. Many Christians, to give it a more familiar example for you, express this as loving themselves as God would love them so that in turn they may love and express love among others.<br/><br/>Is any of this positive nature or the negatives we tend to dwell on an inherent script within our DNA?....I don't think so. These wisdoms are universally part of our education to be individually discovered in this life. What I see inhibiting humanity at this time is their Communication Skills, and willingness to Share. They forget or fear or fail to understand that Sharing or Teaching what they learn is all a part of the whole process. Somewhere they have lost the skill or inclination to reach out with their life, their reality and integrate it with others in a contributional way. This lack of awareness and understanding is creating waves of self-inflicted fear, pain, and chaos which causes perpetuation of the problem. This is something which can be remedied. Someone must go first. Individuals must be willing to lead through example. This is why there is so much potential in the Contact Paradigm and all its facets of existential experience. It gives the opportunity for individuals to remedy this difficulty or inhibition I have described...the vicious cycle of negative circles can be broken....and a fresh paradigm of new choices for human potential laid out for perusal.<hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on May 21, 2009, 2:19am<br/><br/>Publishing Site 1:  <a href="http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/2009/05/discerning-conduits-of-influence-and.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Compass Morainn Journal </a><br/><br/>Publishing Site 2:  <a href="http://www.ufodigest.com/news/0509/mediation.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> UFO Digest </a><br/><br/><b>Discerning Conduits of Influence and Communication in Exopolitical Mediation</b><br/>By Cyrellys Geibhendach<br/>May 20, 2009<br/> <br/>In Exopolitical Mediation, communication among parties rarely occurs within a typical mediation setting.  In mainstream typical mediation, individual participants meet directly with the mediator first individually and then collectively in an agreed upon location.  In Exopolitical Mediation the mediator may be directly involved in only one of the participants but provides avenues of information exchange to the public, among other participants, and among other exopolitical conduits.  Connection with the public, for example, can range in its extensiveness from a simple release of a report on the internet to the more involved release of a book with corresponding interviews and other promotional activities.  Exopolitical Mediation in this way immediately deviates from typical traditional forms of Mediation.  However there remains universal aspects to it such as confidentiality of the participants.  This makes some of the mechanics of exopolitical mediation unique in the general field of mediation.<br/> <br/>Exopolitical Mediation currently occurs in a setting where the Mediator may administer contact with a paradigm participant or source, who holds a perceived position of purposeful leadership in or for that particular release.  This does not mean that all communication within the mediation case occurs in conduit through the Mediator.  Often the Mediator represents only one avenue of communication and networks in the open with other conduits which may well vary in nature.  An example of a variant of conduit can be seen in a release of a recent article in the NY Times, entitled �A Climate Solution That�s Out Of This World�[1].  This variant is a unspecific non-mediated example under the understanding within Exopolitics that the mainstream media outlets are heavily controlled and restricted from serious publication of information or dialog on the subject of extra-terrestrial contact.  So for such a release as the one referenced to occur, a sanction to communicate under specific conditions is assumed to have been given.  This defines the article as a representation of communication from an additional conduit in an environment still engulfed in secrecy and non-disclosure orientation.<br/> <br/>Recognizing additional conduits in a multi-factional environment is a problematic issue for Exopolitical Mediators.  Most of this problem can be mitigated by having an understanding of the current exopolitical condition which includes continually evolving evaluative analysis of the existential evidence of a contact control structure.  Exopolitical Mediators try to balance their understanding of the exopolitical condition through extensive reading and networking with other exopoliticians.  Through these forms of self-education the productive and destructive strategies used by the contact paradigm constituents becomes apparent.  An effective Exopolitical Mediator develops his or her ability to �listen carefully for� other conduits within the paradigm.  <i>�In the most general sense, we have communication whenever one system, a source, influences another, the destination, by manipulation of alternative signals which can be transferred over the channel connecting them,�</i> Osgood.[2]  <br/> <br/>The variety and necessity of obscure communication conduits arose out of the inherent or perceived needs of the parties behind them, in the pervasive secrecy climate of the last sixty odd years.  The contact paradigm has carried the highest level of secrecy status possible within the United States as far as government and its contact paradigm extensions have been concerned.  This has caused a fractured and multi-factional situation whereas the realms (social worlds) of pro and non-disclosure are again broken into many portions which continue fractional existence in many compartmentalized sub-groups.  The extent of sub-groupment is not fully known at this time but releasing sources have routinely described the compartmental nature of the contact control structure and the confusing web of geopolitical inter-relationships which have grown so complex as to defy rational explanations or descriptions.  These inter-relations compete with each other on many levels and spill over into the public presence where they are taken up and mirrored by open humanity in its opinions, and aggressive competing behaviors.<br/> <br/>It is important for the Exopolitical Mediator to be aware of the variety and subtleness of communication forms and conduits in order to understand the various social worlds which lie within the contact paradigm.  When the mediator understand the social worlds involved then it becomes possible to understand the various survival strategies and goals which pervade them.  The Exopolitical Mediator comes face to face with these strategies and goals in life changing ways and must work among them to achieve cohesion of the participants in the evolutionary environment of potential human disclosure.  <i>�If we believe that the way we communicate makes the social world in which we live, and that these forms of communication make different social worlds, then it follows that, if we are to accept our responsibility for making the kind of social world in which we want to live and which we want to bequeath to our grandchildren, we should develop our ability to discern, differentiate, and selectively call into being preferred forms of communication,�</i> W. Barnett Pearce.[3]<br/> <br/>There are many types of survival strategies which are associated with the forces behind individual conduits.  The nature of the individual strategies involved, also vary in the perceptibility of their existential natures.  It is up to the mediator to be discerning to every extent possible to comprehend those natures.  Some of the strategies encountered will be either pro-disclosure nature or non-disclosure nature with contents that range among conflict avoidance strategies, competitive conflict strategies, and cooperative strategies.  It is the responsibility of the exopolitical mediator to focus on the process by which he is managing his interaction with these strategies and to try to avoid getting caught up in the conflict generating potential some of them have.  The exopolitical mediator is not there wage a war but is there to assist the participants to communicate, establish connection and interaction, and to help them find their acceptable avenues for future development of collective options, goals, and common ground.<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>NOTES: <br/>____________________<br/><br/><b>[1] Exopolitical Conduit Release Example:  A climate solution that's out of this world,</b> by Anne C Mulkern, published: May 14, 2009<br/><a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Fgwire%2F2009%2F05%2F14%2F14greenwire-a-climate-solution-thats-out-of-this-world-19116.html&h=256aa688cdb92232fde5f4856a800385" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%....de5f4856a800385</a><br/> <br/><b>[2] Communication for Social Change Anthology:  Historical and Contemporary Readings,</b> A Farewell to Aristotle �Horizontal Communication�, Lewis Ramiro Beltrain, 1979, (SOME TERMS AND ASSOCIATED MEASURES FOR TALKING ABOUT COMMUNICATION, Charles E Osgood, (Urbana, Illinois, Institute For Communications Research 1961) pg 48,) pg 158, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=85WbPmx9QlcC&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=percieving+communication,&source=bl&ots=6BGLQatRbP&sig=krL_ZSeeX344i9EmJSmtNLcl9QE&hl=en&ei=ATwUSunGBKCc8QTl-5CKBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPA158,M1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=85WbPmx....num=3#PPA158,M1</a><br/> <br/><i>�In the most general sense, we have communication whenever one system, a source, influences another, the destination, by manipulation of alternative signals which can be transferred over the channel connecting them.�</i>  Osgood.

He <a href="http://lucianarchy.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=unitednations&action=display&thread=5557&page=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">said</a>, <i>�While it would be nice if governments disclosed what they know, i always thought SETI evidence would be the best way to confirm ET's are real, because all the evidence we present always gets rejected, if SETI catches a signal, everyone will then believe.�</i> [1]  In his frustration for achieving a disclosure he is willing to sacrifice the history of human contact up to that point in time.<br/><br/>But, such a means to disclosure would be a lie, and for all that is known out here beyond the realm of pride and fear, a furtherance of lies puts on additional layers of ill repute, distrust, and feelings of animosity demanding retribution....more lies compounds the problem of disclosure, not help it. It widens the rift and would be encouraging the contextual infrastructure which is built by lies and proscribed a freedom by lies to do as it pleases....that is because such an infrastructure creates a sort of personality complex buried within our collective human psyche which is then picked up and mirrored across the board exponentially as the wave of it ripples outward. No. No more lies....I advocate instead, for all participants to find the courage to be different....be truthful....any possible harshness and horrors of some truths is still not comparable to that which lies inherently generate within us.<br/><br/>By choosing Truths we promote the <a href="http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/2009/05/purpose-and-reason-in-conceptual.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">conceptual communications </a>[2] which we would prefer to enact since promoting them causes the same mirroring effects.  If we wish to live in a positive world then we must will the strength of steel into acting it out in every possible way....even if it means some initial discomfort.<br/><br/><b>When we ask ourselves, </b> <i>&quot;What can we do just to make it through the day?&quot; then we are exhibiting living under a seige mentality....when we ask ourselves, &quot;What is my life about? How can I apply the purpose and principles that my life is about,&quot; then we have made a powerful intervention...because we get our security through our own integrity to our personal value system, rather than from outside reinforcement. &quot;</i> ~ paraphrased, Stephen Covey - Principle-Centered Leadership[3]<br/><br/>It occurred to me shortly after writing the above if my acquaintance really intended to advocate approval of lies to achieve a chip in the block of human disclosure?  I don't believe he did. I think it was ego speaking. <br/><br/>Egos are interlopers in our states of being. They are personal constructs which each individual builds in life. How that construct is applied is up to the individual.  Many people apply them subconsciously out of the construct's persistence of intense 'needs'. In a recent article regarding the <a href="http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/2009/05/purpose-and-reason-in-conceptual.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Purpose and Reason in Conceptual Communications</a>, I said the following: Our egos tend to be, <i>&quot;wrapped up in our social perception of societal expectations which are both extrinsic, concerning relationships of our social groups, and intrinsic, concerning our own behavior, opinions, issues, values, and goals as expected by ourselves or of us by our social groups. The ego is a construct of all these things and does not always adhere </i>to what we really believe or value in ourselves or others.&quot;<br/><br/>When we become aware of ego's insertions within our personal experiences, we are empowered to more closely examine our contribution to the existential construct which we residing in.  This lends opportunity to make adjustments or to reconsider positions for the additional influx of information.<br/><br/>In the reference to SETI which was made above, it illustrated an example of SETI as a potential Mediator of a human disclosure. In this type of mediation, information or data regarding a signal found would be used as evidence or to present evidence of extra-terrestrial intelligence clearly existing. This is (irregardless of its truthfulness) an example of a mediation because of the bridge between two realities they would be providing to at least two group participants identified as knowledgeable insiders and the public.<br/><br/>In regards to the ego involved in advocating a modification to truth, I believe we must tread very carefully in allowing it to dictate to us a course of action which we ourselves or our future posterity may well find paying for in unintended ways. <br/><br/><b>Michael A Melton, M.S. Psy D., </b>just released (05/23/09), an examination of the function and positioning of ego in an exopolitical mediator, in his article: <a href="http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/2009/05/proper-mindset-and-attitude-for.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Proper Mindset and Attitude for Successful Mediation.</a> He concludes that the mediator's ego must remain neutral or be restrained in order for the mediator to be effective and that to be effective a mediator must be truthful. Now while he primarily refers to actual potential mediation events between humanity and ETs with a human mediator, I think the same importance of neutrality, restraint, and dogged adherence to truth is just as important when the mediation occurring is between knowledgeable insiders and the earth-bound, human public.<br/><br/>Mr. Melton said that mediators will be <b>�counted on�</b>, which I interpret to mean that in the face of so many initial unknowns, whoever takes position as mediator(s) in the blooming of contact awareness will hold <a href="http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/2009/05/purpose-and-reason-in-conceptual.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>'interpersonal linkage-power'</b>.</a> In exopolitical mediation I take this power to mean, <i>&quot;the mediators ability based on their perceived influence with people who control psychological or social resources within a participatory group. This power is necessary to developing a group culture among participants where a collective personality and point of view or understanding is negotiated by the members (participants) of the mediation group; in whatever way those participants are defined in the mediation process.&quot;</i> [4]<br/><br/>Additionally Mr. Melton went on to suggest just how important is is and why we mediators should portray <i>&quot;what eminent psychologist Carl Rogers calls <b>�Unconditional Positive Regard.� </b>The brilliant Carl Rogers explains that unconditional positive regard is accepting the other person, or entity, in the current moment, regardless of status, crime, or temperament, or culture, beliefs, and attitude, as a good person, or entity, at face value, as long as the current moment lasts. Maintaining this attitude causes the mind of the caregiver, or in this case, the mediator, to remain neutral. If you embrace the other with unconditional positive regard, then any discriminating feelings, thoughts or behavior would, logically, be incompatible with that mindset. Maintaining that attitude will increase the chances of successful mediation, because you will treat all involved in the same way � equally fairly, and with positive intention.&quot;</i> [5]<br/><br/>Now, if humanity initiates a mediation, deliberately using mediators in originating and enacting a disclosure oriented mediation, for the purpose of pure untruths or wholesale modifications of truths then what have we just done? <br/><br/>In doing such a thing, how have we further damaged humanity's ability to believe another or trust another or interact with others or co-exist with others? How would any ET reciprocate in the face of such behavior? How would we, when the lie was discovered? What have we done when we have corrupted the individuals or groups who should be instilled with the ability to be Truthful no matter the circumstances, that they might initiate Mutual Respect, and Mutual Civilized Behavioral Reaction in the face of Contact?<br/><br/>When a global sociological mirror is allowing duplication of dishonesty where do lies stop? <br/><br/><br/><b>Notes:</b><br/><br/><br/>[1] Open Minds Forum, Re: Disclosure by Governments, <a href="http://lucianarchy.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=unitednations&action=display&thread=5557&page=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">darkassasin post #99</a>, May 22 2009, <br/><br/>[2] <a href="http://compassmorainn.blogspot.com/2009/05/purpose-and-reason-in-conceptual.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">�Purpose and Reason in Conceptual Communications�, </a>Cyrellys Geibhendach, Compass Morainn Journal 2009<br/><br/>[3] Principle-Centered Leadership, Stephen R.

The relationship between exopolitical mediators and the participants in their mediation depends on the objective receipt, relay, & extrapolation of facts.  In a tenuous inter-group social climate which ensconces the parties involved, any misunderstandings which result from assumptions can cause those communication events to literally fall apart as stress levels shred the veins of trust built through the act of mediation.  <br/><br/>There has always been a limit of tolerance for disbelief, fact-twisting, emotional-grandstanding, and sensationalizing no matter which end or version of the participant spectrum is involved.  Participant sensitivity, particularly when Insiders or Whistleblowers are involved, is rife with communication apprehension.  The importance of cognitive listening is rarely understood by public observers or public participants in particular.  Cognitive listening is the opposite of assuming.  It is the mental process of understanding and remembering another�s message clearly and concisely.  <br/><br/>The benefits of cognitive listening are the same as they are in other relationships.  <b>Lorna Doone </b>of the blog <b>�Something Good�</b> wrote the following series of articles in which she explains that assumptions can be avoided by asking questions and verifying or clarifying the responses by asking them once again:<br/><br/><b>The Four Agreements Part Four: Don't Make Assumptions</b><b><br/>Part One </b>- <a href="http://o-my-goodness.livejournal.com/22661.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">An Introduction </a><br/><b>Part Two</b> -  <a href="http://o-my-goodness.livejournal.com/22949.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Be Impeccable With Your Word </a><br/><b>Part Three</b> - <a href="http://o-my-goodness.livejournal.com/23043.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Don't Take Anything Personally</a><br/><b>Part Four</b> - <a href="http://o-my-goodness.livejournal.com/23518.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Don't Make Assumptions</a><br/><b>Part Five</b> - <a href="http://o-my-goodness.livejournal.com/23921.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Always Do Your Best</a><br/><br/>In part four, <b>�Don�t Make Assumptions,�</b> she gives a very nice list of the benefits of cognitive listening without going as far as defining the term.  She says, <i>�This actually has a lot of benefits.  First of all, you�re spending more time actually communicating with those you care about.  They are able to see that you are willing to take time and effort to really listen to what they have to say.  Secondly, you are going to be able to avoid a lot of stress and drama by not making assumptions.  Finally, you can help create a great example for how you want to be treated.  In fact, you can use your new-found ability to ask questions in order to let others know what you want in life.�</i><br/><br/>In exopolitical mediation, the participants are communicating for the very purpose of expressing what they want in life.  Therefore the leap to assume which is a natural human tendency or habit inhibits this form of communication.  This use of  assumptions occurs during the maturation phase or middle phase of relationship development in which the participants learn each other�s idiosyncratic nature and develop a sense of identity through symbolic labels of the relationship.  The assumptions are synonymous or indicative of the labels that are being developed.  It might therefore be suggested that the participant�s inherent understanding of the information providers involved may be flawed.  It may be useful to return to that foundation introduction for a revitalization of that understanding or to modify the interaction to expound and improve upon the perception of the information provider(s) among them.  <br/><br/>It is within the Mediator�s legitimate power to direct the conversation where improvements in or reiteration of information, or even the use of mnemonic devices may assist the participants to more appropriately and accurately recall or understand information in the way it was intended.  The assigning of symbolic labels or connotative meaning to information given will elicit a personal emotional response on the part of the information giver(s).  The mediator can work through the detriments of assumptive responses or returns on given information by developing a cooperative strategy with willing participants that is complimentary to the communication purposes early on, fully understanding that this occurrence is not atypical in exopolitical mediation.<br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Jun 7, 2009, 5:35am<br/><br/>I've got new posts at:  <a href="http://exopoliticsparadigm.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://exopoliticsparadigm.blogspot.com/</a><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Sept 6, 2009, 6:41am<br/><br/>Ok, this post might require a small explaination first....<br/><br/>I DO have moments of 'cat wiggy on catnip' hense inclined to moments of humor laced insanity....in other words one night I was bored and upon reading the question I just couldn't resist posting an answer:<br/><br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/request/19317/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/request/19317/</a><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Sept 6, 2009, 6:44am<br/><br/>Here's a good yarn.....<br/><br/>Drying Fish Over Politics Self Salted Preservation<br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Drying-Fish-Over-Politics-Self-Salted-Preservation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Drying-Fish-Over-Politics-Self-Salted-Preservation</a><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Sept 7, 2009, 8:39am<br/><br/><i>Cy's recent articles on Hubpages.com</i><br/><br/><br/><b>Why You Might Choose To Go Gem Shopping Today</b><br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Why-You-Might-Choose-To-Go-Gem-Shopping-Today" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Why-You-Might-Choose-To-Go-Gem-Shopping-Today</a><br/><br/><b>Secret Phone System Being Installed in a Private Suburban Chicago Hospital</b><br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Secret-Phone-System-Being-Installed-in-a-Private-Suburban-Chicago-Hospital" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Secret-Phone-Sys....hicago-Hospital</a><br/><br/><b>The Life Between Absolutism and Democracy</b><br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/The-Life-Between-Absolutism-and-Democracy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/The-Life-Between-Absolutism-and-Democracy</a><br/><br/><b>Unwarranted Declarations of Elder Incompetencies and the Unjust Taking of Time</b><br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Unwarranted-Declarations-of-Elder-Incompetencies-and-the-Unjust-Taking-of-Time" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Unwarranted-Decl....-Taking-of-Time</a><br/><br/><b>Homeschool Curriculum Review: the Robinson Curriculum</b><br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Homeschool-Curriculum-Review-the-Robinson-Curriculum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Homeschool-Curriculum-Review-the-Robinson-Curriculum</a><br/><br/><b>We The People....They Underestimated Us - Tea Party Video 2009 By Teen��</b><br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/We-The-PeopleThey-Underestimated-Us-Tea-Party-Video-2009-By-Teen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/We-The-PeopleThe....eo-2009-By-Teen</a><br/><br/><b>Drying Fish Over Politics Self Salted Preservation</b><br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Drying-Fish-Over-Politics-Self-Salted-Preservation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Drying-Fish-Over-Politics-Self-Salted-Preservation</a><br/><br/><b>On The Value of Communicating Personal Truths</b><br/><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/On-The-Value-of-Communicating-Personal-Truths" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/On-The-Value-of-Communicating-Personal-Truths</a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>I decided on my next subject/project this evening and it's gonna be a big one.

Comrade Hussein Obama.  Of course, this can be considered both PRO and CON, depending on your point of view, your upbringing, and your moral direction, or lack thereof.<br/> <br/>I've watched some of the strangest interviews on TV (both national and local), following the historical election of Obama, back in November of last year, and what blew my mind, was the shear stupidity of people's reasoning, as to why, they voted for him.   Several young blacks, both male and female were interviewed on the streets of NYC, by both CNN and FOX News, during the aftermath of the election, and the wild parties that followed.  And to hear the statement I heard, makes me wonder where these fools were educated, or if they were even educated at all!<br/> <br/>When asked why he voted for Obama, one responded .... &quot; ... because he's a 'brutha' ...!&quot;     First, its wonderful that one would be ecstatic that after some 230 plus years, a black man stepped up to the ultimate position of leadership.  Certainly, they should be proud, however .... did any bother to check out whether Obama was even qualified to hold the position?  <br/> <br/>Obviously not, and now, many Americans (of all ethnicities and races) are questioning his right, his authority and his qualifications (to include whether he is a &quot;natural born citizen&quot;), and of course, the instant response is &quot;you are unpatriotic&quot;, or some other nonsensical attack, generally led by liberals and those espoused to that way of thinking.   <br/> <br/>Instead of finding out the TRUTH, they do all they can to declare those opposed or questioning, as unpatriotic.  But let me backup here, and state, it actually started during the &quot;reign of terror&quot; of the incompetent fool, George W. Bush.  BOTH parties and their hacks, are directly responsible, must be held accountable, for their multiple act of treason, against our nation!<br/> <br/>Let me throw out the ultimate question to YOU ... how do you define &quot;patriot&quot;?   You need to look inward, within your own soul, and figure that one out, and ask yourself, is America worth defending, or is it a losing situation?<br/> <br/>For the past three or four generations (of the 20th and 21st century), countless men and women have donned the uniforms of our armed forces, to defend all that is America, and one has to ask, to what end?  Was it worth it?  Was the price paid by these kids justified?<br/> <br/>In 1964, I went to war, as a 17 year old kid, wearing a pretty green utility uniform, which ended in 1970, in a hospital bed.   Having left  bit of me in Vietnam, was worth it to me, because as a young idealistic kid, I was defending my country from Communism.  Many called that ... &quot;PATRIOTIC&quot;.   And there is no doubt in my mind and heart, that the kids coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq, having left a little bit of themselves there, are also patriotic.  Too bad the corrupt Washingtonian &quot;leadership&quot; does not understand this concept.<br/> <br/>Yet ... NOW our own home-grown Hitleresque &quot;geheimerstaatspolizei&quot;   (Homeland IN-Security), labels returning vets as &quot;potential terrorists&quot;.  Is this the new definition?<br/> <br/>As we watch all the unbelievable  and corrupt  filth coming out into the open, first in the Bush regime, and even moreso, the Obama regime, through such UN-constitutional acts as the &quot;Patriot Act&quot;, and its many incarnations, doesn't it make you stop and think ... &quot;my God, what happened to my America?&quot;<br/> <br/>Ask yourself, can a Socialist/communist be patriotic?  Sure ... in Cuba, or Venezuela, or the former Soviet Union, but America?  Somehow, most of us who fought this &quot;devil in red&quot; through the past generations, cannot believe the changes that have transpired, in one short year.   And to think, we were fighting on foreign lands, to prevent communism from invading our shores.  Who opened the door?<br/> <br/>Again, can a socialist be patriotic?  How does one say yes, when you look back at the sacrifices that millions of veterans and active military have made, to defend our way of life?  How can we justify it?<br/> <br/>When Senate leader Reid, a socialist, dressed in the facade of &quot;Democrat&quot;, thanks all the special interest groups for their part in the trillion-dollar stimulus bill, can we. or dare we,. call that &quot;patriotic&quot;?   When the president says &quot;we need a highly trained and armed national police force, as well funded as the military.&quot;  does this scare the hell out of you?  Could that be labeled &quot;patriotic&quot; under any circumstances?  Isn't that what Hitler said in 1932. when he created the GESTAPO and its sister unit, the &quot;SS&quot;? <br/> <br/>When questionable &quot;Czars&quot; (unelected and non-accountable assistants) surrounding the president talk about neutralizing the national debate with statements like .... &quot;there cannot be an opposition party without an opposition media!&quot;  does this not give you pause, to ask what the hell is going on?  Simply, it follows that these are not patriotic Americans.<br/> <br/>When the president's appointed (not elected, nor accountable) advisor, Anita Dunn publicly stated to a high school audience that her favorite political philosopher is the late Chinese dictator Mao Tse Dong, can that even be remotely considered &quot;patriotic&quot;?   In who's nightmare?<br/> <br/>When Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi states that &quot;our Constitution is a living document&quot; which can be changed or modified to fit the situation, or time, , and must be interpreted and modified based on modern norms and culture, she is not patriotic ... she has grossly violated her Oath of Office, to defend the Constitution!<br/> <br/>When the vast majority of our 535 Representatives and Senators  vote on bills which they cannot, or will not read in their entirety, and spend billions which America cannot afford, they are not patriots .... they are traitors, to the very nation we have given our all to defend.<br/> <br/>Confused yet?  Do you understand what a PATRIOT (or being &quot;patriotic&quot;) really means?   Don't feel bad .... more than half of all Americans of this younger generation don't either.   If you still don't understand, ask that young Marine, next time you see one, in his wheelchair, or on his metal legs?  Ask him to define the word for you!<br/> <br/>Today in our history, November 21, 2009, 50 Democrats just committed an act of TREASON, which will go down in the history books, which will steal from you and me, and our grandchildren, their rights and future, by passing a cloture vote to allow open debate on the so-called &quot;ObamaCare&quot; nightmare.  It also opens the door, for Harry Reid (D-Neveda), the Senate leader to &quot;shortcut&quot; the vote by using the &quot;nuclear&quot; vote (strange word?) which will require only 51 votes to pass this 2-TRILLION dollar boondoggle, which will bankrupt the nation, the cost of which will be borne by our great-grandkids, not even born yet!<br/> <br/>What can, or should we do?  Immediate RECALL of every sing individual; (not worrying about the parties; remove the INCUMBENT!), NOW.  Between now, and the final vote, every single &quot;Tea Party&quot; go-er, Patriot, and anyone, of any party, bent, or belief, who feels we have been attacked by these UNPATRIOTIC treasonous politicians, need to gather NOW, during the holiday season, and begin a total recall action, of every sing one.  Do not wait til election time, next November .... do it now.<br/> <br/>Governor Grey in California broke the bank in California, and they replaced him almost immediately with Ah-nold Schwatzenegger, who did even worse.... it they can do it there, there is no reason patriotic Americans can't do it, nationally.<br/> <br/>Gee .....

Carrio, CMI  <br/>ESOP Committee Member     <br/><br/> Cap and Trade: A License Required for your Home <br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Cap and Trade: A License Required for your Home<br/><br/>We encourage you to read the provisions of the Cap and Trade Bill that has passed the House of Representatives and being considered by the Senate. We are ready to join the next march on Washington! <br/>This Congress and whoever on their staffs that write this junk are truly out to destroy the middle class of the USA....<br/><br/><br/>A License Required for your house <br/><br/>Thinking about selling your house - A look at H.R. 2454 (Cap and trade bill) This is unbelievable! <br/><br/><br/>Only the beginning from this administration! Home owners take note & tell your friends and relatives who are home owners! <br/><br/>Beginning 1 year after enactment of the Cap and Trade Act, you won't be able to sell your home unless you retrofit it to comply with the energy and water efficiency standards of this Act. H.R. 2454, the &quot;Cap & Trade&quot; bill passed by the House of Representatives, if also passed by the Senate, will be the largest tax increase any of us has ever experienced. <br/><br/>The Congressional Budget Office (supposedly non-partisan) estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be $6,800 per year. <br/>�No one is excluded. <br/>However, once the lower classes feel the pinch in their wallets, you can be sure these voters get a tax refund (even if they pay no taxes at all) to offset this new cost. Thus, you Mr. And Mrs. Middle Class America will have to pay even more since additional tax dollars will be needed to bail out everyone else. <br/><br/><br/>But wait. This awful bill (that no one in Congress has actually read) has many more surprises in it. Probably the worst one is this: <br/>�A year from now you won't be able to sell your house. Yes, you read that right. <br/>The caveat is (there always is a caveat) that if you have enough money to make required major upgrades to your home, then you can sell it. But, if not, then forget it. Even pre-fabricated homes (&quot;mobile homes&quot;) are included. <br/>�In effect, this bill prevents you from selling your home without the permission of the EPA administrator. <br/>�To get this permission, you will have to have the energy efficiency of your home measured. <br/>�Then the government will tell you what your new energy efficiency requirement is and you will be forced to make modifications to your home under the retrofit provisions of this Act to comply with the new energy and water efficiency requirements. <br/>�Then you will have to get your home measured again and get a license (called a &quot;label&quot; in the Act) that must be posted on your property to show what your efficiency rating is; sort of like the Energy Star efficiency rating label on your refrigerator or air conditioner. <br/>�If you don't get a high enough rating, you can't sell. And, the EPA administrator is authorized to raise the standards every year, even above the automatic energy efficiency increases built into the Act. <br/>The EPA administrator, appointed by the President, will run the Cap & Trade program (AKA the &quot;American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009&quot;) and is authorized to make any future changes to the regulations and standards he alone determines to be in the government's best interest. Requirements are set low initial y so the bill will pass Congress; then the Administrator can set much tougher new standards every year. <br/>�The Act itself contains annual required increases in energy efficiency for private and commercial residences and buildings. <br/>�However, the EPA administrator can set higher standards at any time. <br/>�Sect. 202: <br/>Building Retrofit Program mandates a national retrofit program to increase the energy efficiency of all existing homes across America . <br/><br/>Beginning 1 year after enactment of the Act, you won't be able to sell your home unless you retrofit it to comply with the energy and water efficiency standards of this Act. <br/><br/>You had better sell soon, because the standards will be raised each year and will be really hard (I.e., ex$pen$ive) to meet in a few years. Oh, goody! The Act allows the government to give you a grant of several thousand dollars to comply with the retrofit program requirements if you meet certain energy efficiency levels. But, wait, the State can set additional requirements on who qualifies to receive the grants. <br/><br/>You should expect requirements such as &quot;can't have an income of more than $50K per year&quot;, &quot;home selling price can't be more than $125K&quot;, or anything else to target the upper middle class (and that's YOU) and prevent them from qualifying for the grants. <br/>Most of us won't get a dime and will have to pay the entire cost of the retrofit out of our own pockets. More transfer of wealth, more &quot;change you can believe in.&quot; <br/><br/>Sect. 204: <br/>Building Energy Performance Labeling Program establishes a labeling program that for each individual residence will identify the achieved energy efficiency performance for &quot;at least 90 percent of the residential market within 5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.&quot; <br/><br/>This means that within 5 years 90% of all residential homes in the U.S. must be measured and labeled. The EPA administrator will get $50M each year to enforce the labeling program. The Secretary of the Department of Energy will get an additional $20M each year to help enforce the labeling program. Some of this money will, of course, be spent on coming up with tougher standards each year.<br/><br/>Oh, the label will be like a license for your car. You will be required to post the label in a conspicuous location in your home and will not be allowed to sell your home without having this label. <br/>And, just like your car license, you will probably be required to get a new label every so often - maybe every year. <br/>But, the government estimates the cost of measuring ! the ener gy efficiency of your home should only cost about $200 each time. <br/><br/>Remember what they said about the auto smog inspections when they first started: that in California it would only cost $15. That was when the program started. Now the cost is about $50 for the inspection and certificate; a 333% increase. Expect the same from the home labeling program.<br/><br/>Sect. 304: <br/>Greater Energy Efficiency in Building Codes establishes new energy efficiency guidelines for the National Building Code and mandates at 304(d), Application of National Code to State and Local Jurisdictions, that 1 year after enactment of this Act, all state and local jurisdictions must adopt the National Building Code energy efficiency provisions or must obtain a certification from the federal government that their state and/or local codes have been brought into full compliance with the National Building Code energy efficiency standards.<br/><br/>a license required for your home - Google Search<br/><br/>H.R . 2454: American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (GovTrack.us)<br/><br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Signed, Frank Carrio, CMI <br/>Certified Master Inspector & Consultant<br/>Certified Commercial Building Inspector<br/>Certified, WDI Inspector <br/>Founder & Current President, New Hampshire State Chapter NACHI <br/>NACHI, State Representative for Legislative Affairs<br/>Retired: ICC Certified Member <br/>Retired: Code Compliance Inspector.<br/>Retired: ASTM Committee Member  <br/><br/><hr size="1"/><b>Re: Cyrellys:  Letting the Days Go By</b><br/>Post by cyrellys on Dec 5, 2009, 11:07am<br/><br/><b>A Quote Worthy of Integration:</b><br/><br/><i><br/><br/>Where does intrinsic security come from?  it doesn't come from what other people think of us or how they treat us.

Coming from a neighbor you really shouldn't put up with much of the BS.  Jake has respect for you as do I.   So get your saddle out and your spotlight so we can see what's really going on?   If there are things you can't speak about- don't.  Maybe the situation has put people in harms way.  A fair and balanced mind will understand considering the topic.   <br/>To just up and leave?  Clay and Shawn I understand.  But You??  Ed didn't book.  <br/><br/>Ah the weight of the &quot;temporary&quot; world.<br/><br/>Hope you are well.<br/><br/>p.s.- meant sincerely.<br/><br/>pss..
