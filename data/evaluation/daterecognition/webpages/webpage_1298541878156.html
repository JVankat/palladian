<p><b>Interview with Alex Katz<br>
  Conducted by Paul Cumings<br>
  At the Artist's studio in New York City<br>
  October 20, 1969</b><b><br>
  <br>
  </b><b>Preface</b></p>
<p>The following oral history transcript is the result of a tape-recorded interview 
  with Alex Katz on October 20, 1969. The interview was conducted at Alex Katz's 
  studio in New York City by Paul Cummings for the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian 
  Institution.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Interview</b></p>
<p>PC: PAUL CUMMINGS<br>
  AK: ALEX KATZ</p>
<p><br>
  PC: Today is October 20. Paul Cummings talking to Alex Katz in his giant studio 
  here. How many square feet is this? Five thousand or something like that?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, five thousand.</p>
<p>PC: Let's see, you're a New Yorker -- right?</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: Born here in 1927. Whereabouts in New York?</p>
<p>AK: Sheepshead Bay.</p>
<p>PC: Which is out in Brooklyn?</p>
<p>AK: The end of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>PC: Did you live there for a long time?</p>
<p>AK: No, I lived there for a year and a half. Then we moved to St. Albans, Queens.</p>
<p>PC: And that's where you grew up?</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: Did you like it?</p>
<p>AK: Queens? Yes. It was nice.</p>
<p>PC: Back in the Twenties, right at the start of the Depression?</p>
<p>AK: I guess it was the Depression.</p>
<p>PC: Did you go to primary schools?</p>
<p> AK: Yes, I went to a public school in Queens. I wanted to study art. The teachers 
  in that school told my parents to send me to Music and Art or Industrial Arts. 
  My parents didn't like the idea of my traveling that far and wanted me to go 
  to an academic high school. Finally they chose a vocational high school because 
  it had more art; they had art every day. So actually I went to a trade school.</p>
<p>PC: Which one?</p>
<p>AK: Jamaica Vocational High School. It later became Woodrow Wilson High School.</p>
<p>PC: Oh! That's the famous Woodrow Wilson High School.</p>
<p>AK: Oh, yes. That was a nefarious school. You've heard of it?</p>
<p>PC: Yes. </p>
<p>AK: Jamaica Vocational was more woolly. </p>
<p>PC: It's a big school, too, isn't it?</p>
<p>AK: It's a good-sized school. It was new. Hardly anyone was in it when I was 
  there. It was half empty. I don't know what it's like now. It was wild. It had 
  a cop's car _________ in front of the school every afternoon.</p>
<p>PC: Even in those days?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. From the beginning of time. Someone was always making the headlines.</p>
<p>PC: That's wild.</p>
<p>AK: It was a wild school.</p>
<p>PC: It sounds as if you got interested in art very early. Did you draw and 
  make sketches in things?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, I started pretty early. I wanted to be I didn't know what kind of 
  an artist.</p>
<p>PC: But that was just . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, just like doing it. Yes.</p>
<p>PC: Did your family encourage this? Or did they say, &quot;Oh, no, no . . .?&quot;</p>
<p>AK: No, they had artists who were friends. They had come from Russia and they 
  had friends who were painters and we had lots of Russian Expressionist paintings 
  at home.</p>
<p>PC: So you had pictures and things at home?<br>
  <br>
  AK: There were pictures all over the house.</p>
<p>PC: So there was art interest in the home?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. When I was going to high school I'd spend weekends lettering. My father 
  thought I was nuts. He could see me painting, but lettering he thought was just 
  terrible. He thought to become an artist was pretty all right but to become 
  a lawyer or a priest or a doctor was terrible.</p>
<p>PC: Really, That's extraordinary.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. He thought that like an architect was about the highest thing you 
  could become.</p>
<p>PC: Design giant buildings.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. He thought that was like something. He had no respect for the other 
  stuff. But an artist was all right. A fine artist particularly.</p>
<p>PC: That's very interesting. So you got encouragement then?</p>
<p>AK: Well, not entirely. My mother didn't want me to be a fine artist because 
  she thought they lived a very hard life. So when I studied commercial art everything 
  was all right. When I switched to fine art later on, she wasn't . . . I mean 
  she said, &quot;Well, that's the way it goes&quot; but she felt there were better 
  ways to lead a happier life than being a fine artist.</p>
<p>PC: Do you remember any of the painters whose paintings were around the house?</p>
<p>AK: There was a guy named Berkowitz who had these very nice I guess Russian 
  Expressionist things out of Cezanne. There were a lot of paintings. I never 
  liked them when I was a kid. It was after I had been painting for several years 
  that I realized they were better than I was. When I was a kid I thought they 
  were just crap.</p>
<p>PC: That's fascinating. Are there any other children in the family?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, I have a brother; he's younger.</p>
<p>PC: And he's not too interested in art?</p>
<p>AK: No, not at all.</p>
<p>PC: What does he do?</p>
<p> AK: He's a used car buyer.</p>
<p>PC: A used car buyer!</p>
<p>AK: Yes. My uncle sells them. He buys them.</p>
<p>PC: That's certainly a far cry from what you're doing, isn't it?</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: Did you have any interest in music?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I played the violin for, oh, four years or so. I was in the high school 
  orchestra or what it was there. But I liked jazz a lot.</p>
<p>PC: Really?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. And at a certain point I realized that I should just forget about 
  the violin and start all over on the saxophone. But I said, &quot;To hell with 
  it.&quot; And I think I was running track and the music finally conflicted with 
  track -- they came at the same time -- so I let the violin go.</p>
<p>PC: What did you do? Run?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. And jump.</p>
<p>PC: How fast do you go?</p>
<p>AK: Oh, it was all right, you know, I ran a four-forty. We got a couple of 
  city medals. I was interested in track, violin, you know, art was all . . . 
  . But I like jazz. I used to go dancing a lot and stuff like that.</p>
<p>PC: Did you take up the sax then or not?</p>
<p>AK: No, no. I just let it go. I was too busy.</p>
<p>PC: You can't really do jazz on the violin.</p>
<p>AK: No. That was it. They had all those guys like who were terrific musicians 
  and lot of them were playing pro; they'd have their jam sessions and I felt 
  just like a turkey with a violin. They had great dances at our school, too. 
  They used to come from all the other schools. It was like a real big party. 
  Those four years were a big party at that school. We had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>PC: They didn't make zip guns in those days, did they?<br>
  <br>
  AK: No. But the guys had knives and people were always getting arrested and 
  stuff like that. But school was so much fun that people wouldn't cut classes 
  to go any other place.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, really?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. It was a lot of fun. I had a great time. Didn't learn anything.</p>
<p>PC: You had lots of important teachers that stand out in your memory?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I had an English teacher who was kind of nice. When I left the school 
  she said, &quot;You've wasted four years here.&quot; I said, &quot;Yes. But 
  I had a great time.&quot;</p>
<p>PC: You were taking, what? One art class or so?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, every afternoon we had art. They had casts there. I saw some cast 
  drawings that I thought were terrific. So, while a lot of the other kids were 
  making war posters, I was copying these casts every day for about a year and 
  a half.</p>
<p>PC: Do you remember any of the teachers you had?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I had one teacher all the time. His name was Leo Richlin. He had studied 
  at the National Academy and he was pretty good at drawing casts. He was kind 
  of a moron.</p>
<p>PC: Old academic . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: I didn't know the difference. He was very good at what he could do. But 
  there was nothing to do with fine art.</p>
<p>PC: It didn't really get off the ground.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Even in the commercial art, it sort of never got into anything.</p>
<p>PC: He taught both?</p>
<p>AK: Well, it was all commercial art.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, the whole thing was commercial art?</p>
<p> AK: Yes. There were guys in the neighborhood who sort of had similar interests. 
  There was one friend who quit Pratt and became a designer. His name was Ken 
  Fleischner. He took me to New York and we went to look at the Museum of Modern 
  Art. He was hot on Mondrian. [inaudible] But I liked <i>Broadway Boogie Woogie</i> 
  very much. I thought it was absurd when I first saw it because it was like jazz 
  to me, And there was another guy, a friend of mine, who was maybe a year older, 
  who quit school and had gone into big-time advertising when he was sixteen. 
  He told the teacher, &quot;You have nothing more to teach me.&quot; And at nineteen 
  he was knocking down five or six thousand dollars a year. In those days that 
  was a lot of money. I don't know -- that had more to do with it, I guess, than 
  the teachers really.</p>
<p>PC: Did you come into New York and visit the museums very much?</p>
<p>AK: Not very much. I wasn't interested much.</p>
<p>PC: You were busy out there working away and dancing?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I was having a very nice time.</p>
<p>PC: What happened when you finished high school? Where did you decide to go?</p>
<p>AK: Well, people were getting drafted. It was 1940. I got out early, I guess 
  in December 1940, before there was any war on. I decided to work commercially 
  for a while. So I got a job in an offset house in New York City at Eleventh 
  Avenue and 48th Street pasting up movie brochures. There was a guy there, Jimmie 
  Stevenson, who had studied at Cooper Union. He was about ten years older than 
  I. He was quite sophisticated. And he used to be kidding me all the time. We 
  became pretty good friends. He was a real interesting guy. He had been a professional 
  boxer.</p>
<p>PC: Really?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. His mother made him stop. He had like thirty straight wins. He went 
  to Cooper Union. He was a kind of strange guy. He was very intellectual. I don't 
  think you could force him into a fight. I don't think he had two street fights 
  in his life. He was intellectual about everything. Anyway, I guess he started 
  a lot of things going for me. I worked for about six months and then I decided 
  to join the Navy because it looked like there weren't very many ships going 
  down. Then I got drafted on V-J Day. There was a great big party for me. I really 
  got a lucky break. I was in the Navy for a year. And I got the GI Bill, $300 
  mustering out pay, and the 52-20 Club. I was just towed right in. I was overseas 
  for six or nine months or something like that. I had a great time all over the 
  world.</p>
<p>PC: Where were you?</p>
<p> AK: Marseilles, Panama, Japan, all up and down the West coast a lot of times. 
  I don't remember where else. But it was a lot of fun; I had a great time. I 
  had been up for a scholarship to Pratt from the high school and I didn't get 
  it. So when I came back I thought I could get in there. I called them up. It 
  was right after the War and they were crowded.</p>
<p>PC: Thousands of people.</p>
<p>AK: Right. Then I heard about Cooper Union. I called them up. They were having 
  a test the next day. So I went down and took the test. And I'll be Goddamned 
  if I didn't get in! That was like a real shock to me. And a shock to everybody 
  else. I intended to go to another school any old way. But I didn't want to go 
  to college. I wanted to go to art school.</p>
<p>PC: What were you in the Navy? What did you do?</p>
<p>AK: Just a seaman.</p>
<p>PC: Who did you study with at Cooper then? What kind of program did you have?</p>
<p>AK: They had that sort of rough Bauhaus program. I had art history with Paul 
  Zucker, you know. I was at a fantastic disadvantage after coming from the trade 
  school because most of -- one-third -- of the guys there had been going to night 
  school or else had come from Music and Art.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, so they'd been at it for five years.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Well, they were oriented. I didn't know what was going on there at 
  all. It was like a joke. I didn't know how to write a book report. My idea about 
  a book report would be that . . . . Well, the guy who gave you the assignment 
  has read the book so don't bore him with the plot or anything about it.</p>
<p>PC: Tell him what you think of it.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. And it wasn't appreciated. So I just found out who had an &quot;A&quot; 
  book report and found out what a book report was like. But that was a hell of 
  a way to be there. It was like a very high pressure place at that time. Zucker, 
  the art history teacher, got me interested.</p>
<p>PC: That's Paul Zucker, right?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I used to call him &quot;Cock.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  PC: Oh, really? That's a great name for him.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. He was very stimulating. Our drawing teacher was Gwathmey. And he 
  was kind of terrific.</p>
<p>PC: How is he as a teacher?</p>
<p>AK: He was terrific for me. For two weeks he never said anything to me. Finally 
  he came over to me and said, &quot;Get a larger pad.&quot; I didn't know what 
  the hell was going on. Then he started saying that all these drawings looked 
  like my instructor's in high school. I said, &quot;Shit.&quot;</p>
<p>PC: That's intriguing.</p>
<p>AK: But he sort of gave one of these . . . actually . . . . Well, it was like 
  the idea of art based on progressivism, you know, which is very common now. 
  But that was the way he started it. &quot;You don't do this anymore; it's old-fashioned.&quot; 
  But I admit this guy Jimmie Stevenson was much more sophisticated about things. 
  So I never took it too seriously. But the whole thing with his point of orientation 
  into stuff he was terrific because he was involved with a lot of things all 
  at once which were an exciting experience.</p>
<p>PC: Well, Stevenson became a friend then?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. He was a friend. One day years later I was asking him about Matisse. 
  He was saying that Matisse was not a very solid painter and I realized that 
  we could never get together. That was the line. Because I was building everything 
  on that and he can't see it. Well, that's it. He didn't know anything about 
  Primitivism, which was like one of things in the air at the time. You know, 
  there was a big sophisticated Primitive idea at the time . I don't know, I was 
  moving in a different direction from him. But I had known him for quite some 
  time. I think Gwathmey was pretty good. He had a nice thing about calling me 
  an artist. Which I thought was silly. You know, I mean you're an art student 
  and he calls you an artist. He was very lively. Oh, I don't know, I just started 
  learning how to draw and I was drawing around the clock. I'd eat my lunch in 
  seven or eight minutes and spend the rest of the time drawing. And he was like 
  very encouraging. He was kind of terrific. In fact, he even asked me to send 
  some stuff to the A.C.A. Gallery.</p>
<p>PC: That was pretty good.</p>
<p> AK: Yes. He said, &quot;Katz, you're doing terrific stuff. They're having 
  a show at the A.C.A. Why don't you send some stuff down.&quot; But it was all 
  political and I just couldn't stand anything political. It really hurt, not 
  about not showing anything but to have . . . . I mean, I'm not going to take 
  the stuff. And it hurt to tell him, &quot;Gee, I'm just not interested in that 
  stuff.&quot; I remember saying it to him. I was very flattered. Then we had 
  a lettering teacher, Daniel Farmer, who was fabulous.</p>
<p>PC: I don't know him.</p>
<p>AK: He's a kind of weird guy. He does funny books. But he sort of got right 
  at one of my weaknesses. And it was like an insurmountable thing. I had him 
  in the first year. And I had done commercial stuff. When he first saw me he 
  said, &quot;You're going to have a terrible time in this class because you're 
  going to have to unlearn everything you've learned.&quot; I thought he was kidding. 
  But he wasn't. I caught him for the second year. I wanted to have my program 
  changed. It was just awful. But somehow it worked out. I don't know -- it was 
  really a terrific accomplishment. I don't know, it led you into an area of like 
  finished lettering that's very abstract; just related to itself. It was quite 
  fascinating, the whole idea of weights and what things are.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, yes. Like typophiles.</p>
<p>AK: Well he would explain that. He would explain that it's something you can't 
  even get into. We were just dealing with finished lettering. And it was very 
  interesting. Then we had a good design teacher. And I guess it was very lively. 
  People went to shows a lot. It was primarily a great design school.</p>
<p>PC: Well, they had a big industrial tradition behind them, too.</p>
<p>AK: Right. Right. Fine art was like a stimulation.</p>
<p>PC: But you started a fine arts program?</p>
<p> AK: No. Everyone takes the same stuff. The second year I started advertising. 
  And we had so many advertising designers. We had this guy Merang who was just 
  terrific. I mean he had a terrifically analytical mind about things. He was 
  a barbarian and couldn't understand fine art but his thinking was very exciting 
  and interesting. I mean he said, &quot;I can't see why Rembrandt made another 
  one after he made one.&quot; We had this guy like Mangravita, the painting teacher. 
  He gave a demonstration the first day. I knew I couldn't paint as good as he 
  could then. But I said, &quot;Shit! If I can't paint better than that I'll eat 
  my paintbox!&quot; I knew I didn't know anything but I knew I was going to be 
  better than that or a lot worse. That was all there was to it. I learned a little 
  bit about painting but not all that much. Then I had carol Harrison for design. 
  She was like the backbone of the school. We had a lot of fun. She was a lot 
  of fun. It was primarily Cubism that they were about. It was really interesting. 
  The conceptions were very easy for me. And the thing really didn't interest 
  me, maybe it was because it was so easy. But it led into all kinds of other 
  things. Cezanne, Poussin, Picasso, Matisse.</p>
<p>PC: This really got you into the art thing for the first time?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I was looking at things. I think the thing is I enjoyed doing it. 
  Once I started to do it, to draw and paint, was just like a great big kick.</p>
<p>PC: The activity.</p>
<p>AK: Yes, it was just a big kick on the side. I liked it a lot. And I figured 
  technically I didn't need any more advertising and I could use fine arts. Actually, 
  I thought I'd become an illustrator and paint on the side. That was my plan. 
  And so I switched to fine arts. I studied sculpture with Hebald and De Creeft. 
  I found that interesting.</p>
<p>PC: How did you like De Creeft as a teacher?</p>
<p>AK: I had De Creeft at Skowhegan; that was later when I got out of school. 
  I had Kantor in the third year painting. he was very good.</p>
<p>PC: How is he as a teacher?</p>
<p>AK: He was very good with me. I'd say, &quot;Is this good?&quot; And I point 
  to this and I'd point to that and he'd say, &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;no;&quot; 
  &quot;no,&quot; &quot;yes,&quot; Or he'd come over and say something and I'd 
  have to figure out why he said it. He was painting gray pictures and I was painting 
  bright pictures. And I couldn't understand why he'd let me do it.</p>
<p>PC: Did you ever figure it out?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. He painted bright pictures afterwards.</p>
<p>PC: Well, they always say many teachers . . . .</p>
<p>AK: He was changing and interested at the time. Of course in design you can 
  only use gray colors.</p>
<p>PC: So you were there -- what? Three years?</p>
<p> AK: I went there for three years. I got a scholarship to Skowhegan. I went 
  there. There we painted every day. Once I started to paint every day, it was 
  just a great big blast.</p>
<p>PC: That was -- what? About 1949?</p>
<p>AK: 1949, right. It was terrific to paint every day. They had Poor there and 
  De Creeft. It was really strange coming from . . . I mean, you know, I studied 
  with Peter Busa at Cooper and I was pretty much in touch with, not New York 
  painting, because I wasn't around, but Busa was part of it. And we got along 
  swell. He really got me into Miro. Got all the Miro books out. All they had. 
  Which was about four. And they were talking about painting from nature. I thought 
  I'd try it. So I painted outdoors directly from landscape. It was a terrific 
  kick.</p>
<p>PC: This was in New York?</p>
<p>AK: No, In Maine. Of course in art school we never painted from models. Our 
  model sat in the corner and read a book. In Maine we made creative paintings. 
</p>
<p>PC: Going to Skowhegan was a whole new kind of opening then?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. It was a big opening because you met guys who were from art schools. 
  They'd been painting five days a week. Like coming from Cooper Union I was gauche 
  about everything, really. I was a big joke. I was like the class clown to the 
  guys. When I went to Skowhegan the guys could paint better than I could technically 
  but they didn't have the intellectual sophistication really. It interested me.</p>
<p>PC: Who was teaching there besides De Creeft and Poor?</p>
<p>AK: Let's see. Poor, I guess Sid Simon, and Anne Poor. I don't know.</p>
<p>PC: Did you work with any specific teacher?</p>
<p>AK: No. I painted and they'd look at it. They used to scream at the stuff because 
  it was real bright colors. Then I tried to do landscapes. I had a lot of fun 
  with them. They were like . . . it was real interesting because I'd paint the 
  landscapes and it was like having a terrific release painting direct. It was 
  a real kick.</p>
<p>PC: This was doing landscapes outside?</p>
<p> AK: Outdoors, yes. A whole bunch of us would go some place in a car and just 
  paint. It was a lot of fun. The paintings weren't very strong formally or they 
  weren't very . . . . I was interested in very natural things. When I'd go back 
  and look at the stuff I did in art school, that stuff was very kind of mannered 
  but it was like stronger in my color weights and things like that. I decided 
  I wanted to put them together sort of and then I was painting a lot worse after 
  that.</p>
<p>PC: But this was your first painting outside?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, the first direct painting. It was a real kick. I'd been selling spots 
  to Seventeen. Like that was it; that was the top of it. And I figured in about 
  three years I could be like a top illustrator in modern style. And she asked 
  me to do something -- C. P. Penellis. And it was not right. And she said, &quot;Change 
  it.&quot; I couldn't change it. I mean I could change anything now, or I know 
  what I could change. But then I didn't know what the hell I could change. And 
  I said, &quot;Shit! I'd just as soon become a fine artist. I like it more. And 
  that'll take me seven years.&quot; It went like that.</p>
<p>PC: You spent a number of summers at Skowhegan?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I got a return scholarship I guess the next year. And that was it. 
  We hung around in the next town, Lakewood, a whole bunch of us.</p>
<p>PC: Who were some of the people that were students there?</p>
<p> AK: At that time, well, Bill King who had been at Cooper; he was there the 
  year before. And Lois Dodd; and Blackie Langlais was up there. He had just come 
  out of the navy. He signed the wrong paper. He signed himself in for six years; 
  he thought he was signing up for the duration. But he got out. There was a guy 
  named Charlie Bruback and a guy named Stuart Frost. And a guy who used to paint 
  nudes called Wayne Frank. A whole bunch of us. That was about the crowd. Anyway, 
  then I wanted to move to New York. All those guys went to art school here. I 
  went to Brooklyn. So I moved into New York and I became part of the crowd. We 
  had wine parties and dances like we had in high school. Art school style was 
  like another thing. You know, in high school it was like dancing the Lindy Hop 
  stuff. It was all the zoot suit scene. I had eight zoot suits when I was eighteen 
  years old.</p>
<p>PC: With the lapels and the shoulders . . . ?</p>
<p> AK: Yes. Well, it was like really a fugitive. But anyway, we started going 
  to dance halls. We used to go to the Palladium. We were there when the Cha Cha 
  Cha broke. We used to play Mickey Mouse music and Cuban. And that stuff took. 
  We had a lot of fun. Anyway, the artists' parties were a lot of dancing and 
  screaming. And people who went there thought we were a very fast crowd. We were 
  just kind of nutty. But that went away and, I don't know, the guys just grew 
  up and got married and settled down. And it all disappeared after a while. By 
  then I was well into painting.</p>
<p>PC: Well, you got involved in the Tenth Street scene very early, didn't you?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Well, the guys who formed it . . . . I was at the cafeteria on Broadway. 
  It used to be on Broadway and Eighth Street. I knew Bill King and Lois Dodd. 
  Jean Cohen was in their class. They were all friends. When Bill King was in 
  art school, he was like the best person in the school. That's all there was 
  to it. He was fabulous. And he wanted to swap with me. And I just thought he 
  was absolutely out of his mind. I was very flattered. I didn't take him up on 
  it. Years later I did but at that time I just thought he was insane. But anyway, 
  he got a Fulbright to Italy. In Italy he met Angelo Ippolito. And he knew Cajori 
  from Skowhegan. Bill had gone to Skowhegan the year before and he met Cajori 
  there. And Fred Mitchell was on a Fulbright in Italy. So they all got together 
  and decided to form their own gallery. Which was on fourth Street; it opened 
  on Fourth Street. I was painting in like an open representational style then. 
  And that was like abstract. So the first show I wasn't in. But I was around. 
  But I think shortly after that it was okay to paint representationally if it 
  was &quot;open.&quot;</p>
<p>PC: That's very interesting. And then they moved to Tenth Street and that whole 
  string of galleries opened eventually.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Well, there was no place to show for any advanced painters. I thought 
  it was a lot of crap when they first wanted to . . . . This guy . . . the Roko 
  Gallery which used to be on Greenwich Avenue showed a painting of mine when 
  I was just out of art school. It was mentioned in the paper and I thought it 
  was going to be a real snap.</p>
<p>PC: Then look what happened.</p>
<p>AK: Then a year or two later he asked me to show there. Actually I had the 
  first show; I had a two-man show with Lois Dodd at Tanager. The next year I 
  had a show at Roko. It was a disaster.</p>
<p> PC: Really?</p>
<p>AK Yes. Well, a couple of friends of mine liked it. I didn't sell anything. 
  The only thing I sold was I was working as a mural assistant for this guy Marigliotti 
  and we were doing trompe l'oeil paintings.</p>
<p>PC: Who is he? I don't know him.</p>
<p>AK: He did all the Loew's theatres. He made half a million dollars twice in 
  his life and he blew it and he was going after the third coup. I learned a lot 
  working in his studio. He was a terrific guy. He was paying us like two-and-a-half 
  bucks an hour.</p>
<p>PC: And he's getting paid about thirty for every hour.</p>
<p>AK: Right. Because he couldn't do the stuff. It was all fine painting.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, really?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. It was like trompe l'oeil stuff. He got the job with another man's 
  samples and then split the partnership. So he got myself and some other guy 
  and we learned how to do the stuff and were doing it.</p>
<p>PC: That's fantastic.</p>
<p>AK: He'd make us work Saturdays. He'd buy us great big dinners and a bottle 
  of something. You knew he was conning you but you couldn't . . . his style was 
  just fabulous. What he did to me was he ran down to my show and bought a beautiful 
  painting. And so what could I do? It was like $70. But I mean I really admired 
  the man a great deal for his style.</p>
<p>PC: Obviously. Well, how did you like your first show?</p>
<p>AK: Oh, I was embarrassed.</p>
<p>PC: What did it feel like when you walked in an saw it?</p>
<p>AK: They had this other guy's stuff up front, Robert Andrew Parker's, and he 
  was hot as a two-dollar pistol. And people would come in and buy those things. 
  But then they'd come and they'd look in there . . . .</p>
<p>PC: You were in the back?</p>
<p>AK: No, I had the big gallery. He was sort of like in a little anteroom in 
  the front, you know.</p>
<p> PC: Oh yes, I know.</p>
<p>AK: It was like a gallery but there was like a little thing in front.</p>
<p>PC: Right.</p>
<p>AK: And people would come in and they'd look. And I could see that they were 
  like ready to throw up. Then they'd say, &quot;Are you the artist?&quot; And, 
  Jesus, I just wish I wasn't there. When I was there, anyhow, not much happened. 
  And then he moved uptown. I still thought it was a better thing than fooling 
  around with the Tenth Street thing. I had another show there when he moved uptown. 
  It was sort of like the same thing. This time they were selling the Parkers 
  on the coffee table. I figured I just can't go through one of those things again. 
  It's just all so kind o tacky. And downtown you might not have any commercial 
  possibilities but that wasn't necessary.</p>
<p>PC: You were always a figurative painter at this point, weren't you?</p>
<p>AK: Well, no, I started painting like in an &quot;open&quot; style figuratively, 
  oh, after the Ninth Street show which was like in 1950, I think, wasn't it? 
  I don't know when it was. 1949 or 1950. That show like opened up everything 
  for me. Nell Blaine, Larry Rivers and Jane Freilicher were painting that way. 
  But I didn't know their work at all.</p>
<p>PC: You weren't in that show, were you? -- the Ninth Street show?</p>
<p>AK: No. I didn't know anybody. I was too conceited actually to talk to all 
  the painters. But then I guess by the time I had my show . . . . I saw a lot 
  of Larry Rivers' painting. But I was in it when I saw his. He was doing something 
  that was sort of similar to what I was doing but not really.</p>
<p>PC: I'm just trying to remember his early work.</p>
<p>AK: Well, he was working like -- he had something like a monk. I remember seeing 
  the George Washington shown whenever the hell that was. Maybe it was about 1953 
  or something like that. Or 1954. I don't know when it was.</p>
<p>PC: It was somewhere in there.</p>
<p> AK: Yes. I saw Jane's painting very early, too. But that was like four or 
  five years after I'd been in that style, more or less. </p>
<p>PC: Well, how did you feel, painting like this? Because there was that huge 
  sea of Abstract Expressionism going on out there.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I felt pretty alone. I don't feel that way now. Nothing I do now seems 
  to . . . . Oh, I think there's no comparison in the paintings but I think that 
  . . . . There was a thing where I knew the idea of progressive art to me just 
  seemed not suited to my temperament, the idea of styling, and I was looking 
  for some kind of expression to some other thing.</p>
<p>PC: In what way? You mean through images?</p>
<p>AK: Through the painting just like personal expression more or less, you know. 
  I don't know -- I think I sort of reversed it from painting so much more impersonally 
  in intent and less intimate. That was like constructing an intimate thing. I 
  really liked Matisse and Picasso paintings enormously. And I didn't like any 
  American painting. But the new stuff seemed more exciting than anything else 
  so all my friends were painting it.</p>
<p>PC: You mean the new stuff like Rivers's?</p>
<p>AK: Well, you know, the abstract stuff. It was very exciting.</p>
<p>PC: How about de Kooning?</p>
<p>AK: De Kooning is what everyone liked but I didn't like de Kooning at all then. 
  He just seemed to cold for me. I admired the expertise but didn't have any feeling 
  for it.</p>
<p>PC: How about Kline or Pollock?</p>
<p>AK: Kline really just started then. I liked Pollock right off the bat because 
  it was like landscape painting. I just saw it that way. So I'd paint trees that 
  way, you know. So it was like adapted. It was like a dumb idea. But it helped 
  a lot. And I was working from the point of painting perception. So it was like 
  if you read about Soutine, the way he painted, like compress everything into 
  a single burst of energy. That's what I was about. So it was not that far from 
  Pollock.</p>
<p>PC: So you were really like painting zip!</p>
<p> AK: Zip! All at once! Pow! Then I might fool around with it but basically 
  it was a pow! kind of painting. And Pollock was fine. And Soutine was fine except 
  that . . . . The idea of Soutine was fine; I mean I didn't like his painting, 
  the way he painted. I don't like his painting.</p>
<p>PC: Right.</p>
<p>AK It's not far from the automatic. I felt the only way I could get a natural 
  painting was to paint it wide open. Otherwise it would end up being kind of 
  stylized-looking.</p>
<p>PC: That's interesting. So your paintings really were done like the Impressionists 
  -- at one time?</p>
<p>AK: Quicker. They worked over theirs. Mine was just like real shots. I liked 
  Motherwell's when I first saw them. The old Whitney had some black and white 
  paintings that I thought were pretty nice. But Motherwell seemed more like a 
  European. He was the easiest to grab of that crowd. I liked Guston when I first 
  saw him, and Gorky. I liked them. They were like real related to my temperament.</p>
<p>PC: Well, did you get to know any of, you know, the older circle of painters? 
  Or you just saw their pictures?</p>
<p>AK: I saw their pictures around. Oh, I did when I finally had a big show at 
  the Tanager Gallery in 1959. And then I guess I got to know them all at once. 
  They were terribly nice.</p>
<p>PC: Well, everybody was living in that whole area, too.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I'd say &quot;Hi!&quot; but it didn't mean anything, you know, because 
  it was just another guy saying &quot;Hi!&quot; And remember I was a very conceited 
  young man. The second generation guys, I never felt part of the second generation 
  at all.</p>
<p>PC: You mentioned you were very friendly with Charles Duback.</p>
<p>AK: Duback, yes. Charlie was from Skowhegan. We all lived in the same building 
  -- Charlie Duback and Blackie Langlais. And I think we painted sort of with 
  similar ideas actually.</p>
<p>PC: Was that because you spent time together? Or was it just kind of an osmosis 
  kind of thing?</p>
<p>AK: I don't know. When Charlie first came he was painting like Gorky and de 
  Kooning.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, really?</p>
<p> AK: Yes. He picked it up real quickly. Around 1949 he was doing things like 
  Gorky and de Kooning. Blackie was painting . . . he went to like Matisse and 
  then he went to Pop and was doing like crazy Pop stuff in 1950, 1951, or something 
  like that. Then he went to Europe. He worked in a hard edge studio there, the 
  Grande Chaumiere, where they did old-fashioned stuff. When he came back he was 
  doing like a real sharp kind of new hard edge painting in 1954, 1955, a rough 
  . . . .</p>
<p>PC: Isn't that incredible!</p>
<p>AK: Yes. We picked up on it immediately.</p>
<p>PC: That's very interesting. I didn't know that.</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: And now he's doing little cutout things.</p>
<p>AK: He's doing birds. But he went there painting Pollocks and he came back 
  painting these kind of big flat colors. They were kind of rough. And Charlie 
  and I both picked up on it immediately.</p>
<p>PC: I thought it was out of Leger or something like that?</p>
<p>AK: I think he was out of Neo-plastics. He had a studio there at the Grande 
  Chaumiere. He was working with those guys. Then he went into Expressionist stuff. 
  He just left it.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. He charges through so many things.</p>
<p>AK: He went through a lot of different things.</p>
<p>PC: That's true. Let's see, where did we get to here? We've gone at such a 
  clip year after year.</p>
<p>AK: We're getting very confused. But the other guys I guess I met, you know, 
  sort of gradually when I had a show of those solitary figures on the ground 
  like this one over here. That was like the first really adult show. It was in 
  1959. That was like dropping a lead balloon on Tenth Street. Jeez, the gallery 
  was sort of like you'd think you'd dropped a lead balloon.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. Because it was so different.</p>
<p> AK: Yes. People sort of pounced on them, people screaming in the gallery. 
  They called them illustrations. They had no idea what was in store for them. 
  But anyway the older guys were really terrific. You know, de Kooning came in 
  and he was terribly sweet. He said, &quot;They're like photographs but they're 
  paintings. Don't let them knock you out of it.&quot; Which was kind of terrific. 
  And Philip Guston was just terribly nice to me. And Jack Tworkov and all the 
  guys down there were very nice. They really had no reason to be.</p>
<p>PC: That was true. What about the other painters you own age who were doing 
  something quite different?</p>
<p>AK: Well a lot of them . . . well, it was like a little bit of emulation at 
  that point. Then other people were kind of interested in it.</p>
<p>PC: How did you join the Stable? How did you get involved up there?</p>
<p>AK: Well, there weren't very many galleries to show in in New York. And I'd 
  be Goddamned if I'd ever go back to another gallery that didn't have a little 
  bit of style to it. There was Leo Castelli and John Myers and the Stable as 
  far as I was concerned. The rest of them I didn't like.</p>
<p>PC: Eleanore was in the Stable then?</p>
<p>AK: In the Stable. And the thing with her was she had a great room there. And 
  if you controlled that room you had yourself a reputation right there. And she 
  didn't have any figurative stuff. And she came down to look at the stuff. She 
  said, &quot;What do you want with me?&quot; And then she said, &quot;I'll give 
  you a show next year if your work doesn't go fallow.&quot; But then she did 
  something smart. She said, &quot;Send these two paintings to the gallery and 
  these two you keep.&quot; And she picked the two good paintings to keep so I 
  knew that she had an eye for my work. She figured out the better ones. And I 
  said, &quot;Swell.&quot; And that sort of was that. And then someone dropped 
  out. That was about the time that a lot of painters left for Kootz. So there 
  was a hole there. So I got a show right away. I showed the next year.</p>
<p>PC: How did that one do?</p>
<p>AK: Well, that was a financial disaster. I guess Joe Fiori bought a painting. 
  And she bought a painting, something like that. We didn't sell anything out 
  of the show at all. But it got terrific critical attention and a lot of interest. 
  It was like a very successful show from that standpoint.</p>
<p> PC: How do you like the paintings once you get them out of the studio into 
  an exhibition like that? Do they change a great deal? Do you see them differently?</p>
<p>AK: I see them a little differently. I'm kind of used to it now. It used to 
  be a big shock. The first time I had a painting shown I guess it was okay. The 
  second time I showed a little landscape, a little picture in the Roko Gallery, 
  and some guy blasted that off the wall. It never happened again. I mean it can 
  happen chemically if you get stuck next to something. I learned a lesson there. 
  Then out of the Stable show I was put in the Whitney New Talent show and pictures 
  which I had that I thought were large, which were like four by six, or six by 
  six, or something, were like postage stamps.</p>
<p>PC: Next to those huge things.</p>
<p>AK: Right. And that was something that never happened again. You know, I learned 
  a lot about scale.</p>
<p>PC: It's interesting. So really the exhibitions did have a very direct effect?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, they had a lot of effect. I think when I had my second show at Roko 
  the paintings I thought were beautiful but it was like a question of I couldn't 
  make them any nicer; they were all very finished in that open technique but 
  I just felt it didn't have enough me. And generally when you have an exhibition 
  you always say what you like and what you don't like about it.</p>
<p>PC: I'm curious about Tenth Street. You were -- what? You were a founder of 
  the Tanager Gallery?</p>
<p>AK: No.</p>
<p>PC: You were an early member, though, weren't you?</p>
<p>AK: I was a member -- I wasn't really a member at first -- I was connected 
  with it because all my friends were there and I showed there in a two-man show. 
  I showed there quite a bit. I showed there more than I did any other place. 
  But I wasn't a member of it until the late 1950's. I was . . . like I started 
  with them in 1952 and broke up in 1962. I was showing all along. I used to help 
  out and keep the store open on Thursday nights, things like that. But I think 
  it was after that Roko show that I just said to hell with it. It was later when 
  I became a member. I couldn't afford it in the beginning anyway. It was very 
  hard.</p>
<p>PC: Well, you were living away from your family. You were living in Manhattan?<br>
  <br>
  AK: Yes, in Manhattan.</p>
<p>PC: What do you think of the whole Tenth Street thing now after a few years? 
  What purpose do you think it served?</p>
<p>AK: I think it had a lot to do with setting the style of New York as a painting 
  city. They had more good painters down there than they had in any place. They 
  had a lot of terrific painters there.</p>
<p>PC: Do you think the fact that there were so many people concentrated there 
  . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Well, there wasn't any room uptown. Down there you couldn't complete with 
  a good uptown gallery. But they set a standard somehow. They used to say all 
  kinds of funny things about it. But it served its purpose for the time, I think. 
  It was terrific for all of us. It was a terrific education for me.</p>
<p>PC: I always found it interesting because it was like a commune or something. 
  So many people lived upstairs; there was a gallery downstairs; they all went 
  to the same bars and coffeehouses and places like that and you were always in 
  it.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Well, I think everyone's social life was public. That's what John 
  Button said to me. He was kind of shocked at the way people lived -- the older 
  guys that started it more or less.</p>
<p>PC: Well, did you get involved with The Club ever?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, I was involved with The Club. It was kind of interesting. I was real 
  interested in dialectics. I liked a lot listening to those guys talk, listening 
  to dialectics. And from the point of like not being able to talk in front of 
  more than one person, I got so that finally I got up enough nerve when I was 
  asked to talk there. But also it hardened the thinking a great deal hanging 
  around all those guys. There were an awful lot of bright guys. Someone would 
  say something and someone would look at him and they'd jump on it. You know, 
  it was like you were sloppy. And you weren't sloppy again that way. So it was 
  a terrific ten years or so -- or twelve years actually, around there. It was 
  just a fantastic education for me.</p>
<p>PC: That's very close to the way I saw it, too, because you had so many generations 
  from real young people to . . . .</p>
<p> AK: Yes. You'd talk to guys where you'd get information and stuff. It was 
  quite interesting. A lot of content, you know. And the Tanager was like a real 
  education because those guys were a little older than I was and they'd been 
  around a little more.</p>
<p>PC: Did you show at any of the other galleries there? The Tanager was really 
  . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: The Tanager was my base.</p>
<p>PC: That was the one, yes.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. We were sort of social security. Well, the Tanager was different from 
  all the others anyway. They were all slightly different. But the Tanager . . 
  . . And there was the Hansa Gallery. The Hansa was sort of like German Expressionists. 
  The Tanager group was all more contained and collegiate and slightly more conceited 
  in style. Wasn't it, somehow?</p>
<p>PC: It's interesting to see it that way.</p>
<p>AK: It seemed that way.</p>
<p>PC: But I think they were very independent too at that time.</p>
<p>AK: The Tanager?</p>
<p>PC: Yes.</p>
<p>AK: It was very independent, yes. You know, we had the advantage for a good 
  number of years of not having to worry about selling the pictures. So it started 
  with that. So we'd say what kind of show can we put on that somebody who has 
  to sell pictures can't? So you can show anything you feel like showing as long 
  as it's fun. It gave us a tremendous advantage over the other galleries. We 
  didn't care whether we sold anything or not.</p>
<p>PC: You did your own thing and that was it.</p>
<p>AK: The thing was paying for itself more or less. The rent was forty dollars. 
  It was like no problem to anybody. So we just had an awful lot of fun with the 
  place.</p>
<p>PC: That's terrific. You know, it's amazing when you look back -- I was looking 
  through some papers from there the other day. Wesselmann had his first show 
  there.</p>
<p> AK: Yes. Henry Geldzahler actually told me to go see this guy Wesselmann's 
  work. He said it was influenced by my collages. He had done some little collages 
  that might have been, But then he was doing bigger ones.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. The Great American Dream.</p>
<p>AK: Yes, the still-lifes and stuff. Yes. That was the first show. I saw them 
  and I thought they were fabulous. I got the Tanager members down there and they 
  all thought they were just fabulous.</p>
<p>PC: That's terrific. Well, when did you start doing collages?</p>
<p>AK: 1955.</p>
<p>PC: How did that come about?</p>
<p>AK: I liked Matisse's collages. And I was interested in Marca-Pelli's. And 
  I wanted to do something else. I'd been wanting to do collages I guess for a 
  whole bunch of reasons. I was painting all-over paintings more or less and I 
  wanted to put an edge on it or stop it, you know. But suddenly one day I made 
  one. And when I made it I knew I had it. That was it. The first year I didn't 
  do too many. That was about 1956. I showed them in 1957, a wall of them, in 
  that Roko show. Then it just exploded and I kept doing them through 1960. That 
  was the end of them. I thought I was getting trapped by the line. And they had 
  the element of nostalgia; they were like past tense. I wanted to make something 
  more present tense. I figured they were just getting in my way so I just cut 
  them out. And it was awful because they were like real art. It was kind of rough. 
  And, you know, three years later, two years later, you couldn't go back into 
  it if you tried.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. But you did some sets and things with the cutout figures?</p>
<p>AK: Well, then I went to cutout figures a year or a couple of years later. 
</p>
<p>PC: Which is like a collage without background.</p>
<p>AK: Well, it's just that the line kept moving. But at the time the little collages 
  were so small I had to stop it. I felt I wanted to get into present tense. When 
  I did the cutout it was like I cut up a painting.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, really? </p>
<p> AK: I was working with painting two people. I cut the figure out. I couldn't 
  get the background to work. I spent a winter on it. I had a hard time anyway 
  working on a painting after the first time, you know.</p>
<p>PC: It really had to happen.</p>
<p>AK: It had to happen and I could refine it. But if I had something to really 
  make a change, it was like I just couldn't do it. The guys who painted like 
  de Kooning who'd work all day on a painting . . . it was so alien to my temperament 
  . . . . Also a lot of the guys thought it had a built-in virtue.</p>
<p>PC: Work! Work! Work!</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I felt guilty about it because it wasn't my temperament. But anyway 
  I worked on this one all winter. And sure as hell it didn't come out. The figures 
  looked real good. So I cut them out. I didn't know what the hell to do with 
  them. I had them laying around. One day Bob Rauschenberg came by. He saw them 
  and thought they were terrific. He said, &quot;Just keep them the way they are.&quot; 
  So I mounted them on plywood. They were weird because they were only four feet 
  high; you know, They were lifesize in an eight-foot picture but four feet high 
  in real life. I kept them around for about a year. There was something about 
  them that wasn't art, that illusionary thing, you know. They were really like 
  things. And I decided that the painting didn't go past the edge much so it had 
  a feeling more like the old things where the photos didn't have real life energy. 
  That became the idea, like making the energy of the stroke go past the edges. 
  Then I went into it really hard and did every sculptural idea I could think 
  of, you know. I had a show at Tanager in 1962. And right after that Kenneth 
  Koch and Arthur Storch came by and asked me to do Kenneth's play George Washington 
  Crossing the Delaware. I went right into that.</p>
<p>PC: I'm very curious because you've always been involved with poets, it seems, 
  a group of poets or writers. Or does it just seem that way? </p>
<p>AK: That's true. I don't know. I met Denby and Burkhardt I guess in the middle 
  Fifties or something like that. I met Jane and Frank O'Hara. And Jimmy Schuyler 
  was a friend of Edwin's. And it was just like one thing led to another. I guess 
  we just were interested in each other, in a way, somehow.</p>
<p>PC: You've also painted the people around you?</p>
<p> AK: Yes. I started with that early. It wasn't autobiographical but it was 
  personal in a sense. I think the big change came in 1957 when I started to paint 
  Ada over and over again. I'd splash around with paint and see if I could get 
  the expression in the eyes right and that kind of thing. It always seemed a 
  big gag to me. When I started doing it, I couldn't get a likeness and I couldn't 
  get the expression in the eyes right. I had to break down the whole open style 
  of painting at that point. And I figured . . . well, if I get Ada right, if 
  you only get one person right -- if you get a woman or a man right -- it's universal. 
  So what the hell.</p>
<p>PC: How do you define your term &quot;open&quot; painting?</p>
<p>AK: Well, &quot;open&quot; strokes would be like Titian or Pollock, like an 
  open form that way. And when I started to close it down . . . well, I got interested 
  in . . . where you go from the big stroke to the small stroke, still open -- 
  fluid painting rather than all over is what it was. Is that clear?</p>
<p>PC: Yes -- it still has a . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Fluid. It's very fluid. Everything is fluid. Like every stroke should be 
  controlled and different changes in the scale of the strokes.</p>
<p>PC: It's tighter in a way.</p>
<p>AK: It's much tighter, because they go from real tight to more open in all 
  of the fluid style. Manet's brushwork is all very controlled, as an example. 
  It's not spontaneous; it's not natural, you know. It's fluid. And that was like 
  the big thing to get off this natural painting. Because natural painting worked 
  for a lot of people. But for me I could paint it naturally but then I'd have 
  to want to refine it a little bit and it would look natural. Most people thought 
  my paintings looked unfinished because they were spontaneous-looking. So there 
  was a change there where I wanted to make something that was like fluid rather 
  than natural.</p>
<p>PC: Just to go back for a second, how did you like doing George Washington 
  Crossing the Delaware?</p>
<p> AK: Well, I had a lot of fun. It was a lot of hard work but it was a lot of 
  fun. The whole thing was just a big fiasco. To begin with, they gave me the 
  play. I went into this room with the producer and the director and Kenneth. 
  I said, &quot;I have wonderful ideas. I think the play is essentially two-dimensional. 
  We should have the backdrop three feet away from the actors and it all should 
  be flat and we'll have different colors for different moods for the three scenes. 
  We'll have one set at three feet from the actors, and the other one six feet.&quot; 
  And everyone said, &quot;That's absolutely marvelous. We'll go along with you.&quot; 
  Then I started to work. Arthur Storch said, &quot;I want a big ramp.&quot; I 
  said, &quot;Ramp! You're out of your fucking mind! You can't put a ramp on the 
  stage. It's a two-dimensional play, you idiot. And besides you'll be stuck with 
  that turkey of a ramp for the whole play. And Kenneth, the friend, said, &quot;Alex, 
  just relax and do the cutouts.&quot; I didn't know what to do. So it became 
  like the producer was just about broke. And I said, &quot;I think his idea of 
  a ramp isn't so bad after all. It won't cost you more than four hundred bucks 
  and if it doesn't work, the hell with it.&quot; So then he went back to the 
  director and said, &quot;I think Mr. Katz's aesthetic decision is correct.&quot; 
  So I got rid of the ramp. But that's the way it went. It was all crazy. So we 
  sort of like battled. I didn't know anything about plays. I had done a dance 
  set for Paul Taylor where you just make something and the guy uses it or throws 
  it away. But the director is sort of like a god -- the guy who directs a play. 
  He tells you what to do. You know, I'd give him an idea and he has these magic 
  words &quot;exit&quot; and &quot;entrance.&quot; And that's the thing that confounded 
  me completely. I didn't know how to cope with those two words. Well, we finished 
  it. Eleanor Ward was . . . . And the guy wanted to sell the pieces. His name 
  was John Wolpe. I said, &quot;You can't do this to me. You'll undercut my market.&quot; 
  (Which was a big joke; there wasn't any market!) But I couldn't see selling 
  these things for fifty bucks when I was trying to sell them for three hundred 
  at the gallery. So he said, &quot;I'll tell you what, Alex.&quot; (They were 
  paying the designer's fee for this, which was $220.) But I was making the stuff 
  besides. So he said, &quot;We'll cut $20 off the designer's fee and if the show 
  folds you'll get the pieces.&quot; So I said, &quot;Great!&quot; Because that 
  show just had to fold. I mean it was a great play; the sets were great. Did 
  you see it?</p>
<p>PC: No.</p>
<p>AK: It was great; it was spectacular. We had the Delaware River cut out and 
  that popped up. We had a boat with everybody in it and flags. It was fabulous. 
  He had people running through the audience. You know, if you tried to walk out 
  on that one you'd get stomped to death. It was a terrific play. But it was on 
  a program with an Elaine May thing that wasn't much. And an play which was doomed, 
  I'm afraid. He still could carry it but he didn't have any money to carry it. 
  You see, it got bad reviews in the dailies. It got fabulous reviews in like 
  the Commonweal and in The Nation. It got a lot of really terrific reviews. And 
  if he could have held it, he could have used the reviews or something.<br>
  <br>
  PC: Who was the producer?</p>
<p>AK: John Wolpe I guess.</p>
<p>PC: He's painting now.</p>
<p>AK: I guess it's the same guy. But at the time he thought television was black 
  and white.</p>
<p>PC: Did you see that show of his?</p>
<p>AK: No. He was a very funny guy,</p>
<p>PC: It's strange painting.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. So Martha Jackson was looking for a show. Eleanor Ward gave a hundred 
  dollars to them for their performance and didn't go. But John Gruen I guess 
  told Martha Jackson so she came around and said, &quot;I'll buy that.&quot;</p>
<p>PC: Really?</p>
<p>AK: That was when she went to the Claes Oldenburg Happening looking for the 
  Alex Katz cutouts. And in the middle of the Happening she said, &quot;This isn't 
  Alex Katz. What am I doing here?&quot; And she walked out with her entourage. 
  And later came down to the other place and we dragged the things out. We haggled 
  about the price. Finally she got this glint in her eye. There was one with three 
  British soldiers. She said, &quot;Okay. Your price if you sign this piece three 
  times.&quot; Isn't that funny? You could just see the saw in her mind. So she 
  had the show. It made Newsweek and it was like a real sensation.</p>
<p>PC: I remember it was downstairs. Things were standing all over the place.</p>
<p>AK: She had the show of the stuff. There was a lot of publicity. It was like 
  the first time I was thought of as being a jazzy number. And it was so funny 
  because we hung the show - it was like two years' work -- life and death -- 
  on the wall. Then I had a guy from Newsweek chasing me all over Maine. It was 
  wild. He was asking me questions because they said I was a semi-beat. And he 
  was looking mostly for wild life. He was asking me questions about semi-beat 
  and I'd say, &quot;Don't you know that's unfashionable?</p>
<p>PC: Well, you taught at Skowhegan, didn't you?</p>
<p>AK: Right. I taught there I guess in 1960, then years after I went there as 
  an art student.<br>
  <br>
  PC: You had taught before at Yale -- right?</p>
<p>AK: Yale was really the first. That was about ten years after I got out of 
  art school.</p>
<p>PC: How did that come about?</p>
<p>AK: Well, Welliver needed someone in the class there. My first job was visiting 
  critic at Yale University. It paid real well. I was working then in a frame 
  shop. So I quit.</p>
<p>PC: What frame shop?</p>
<p>AK: I worked at Kleist's.</p>
<p>PC: I didn't know that -- the drawing place?</p>
<p>AK: That was a drawing place. I spent almost ten years there.</p>
<p>PC: I didn't know that. It's amazing everybody worked in a frame shop or they 
  . . . .</p>
<p>AK: They did house painting; all kinds of crap.</p>
<p>PC: Speaking of framing to make a living, what were you doing in the first 
  years after school besides teaching?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I worked in a frame shop for four days a week. I had all kinds of 
  jobs. I delivered mail. I did odd jobs. At one time I was a bill collector in 
  Harlem. It was a wild job, you know these quarter installment things; running 
  through with sixty dollars in quarters in your pockets going through back halls.</p>
<p>PC: Click. Click. Click.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Right. They never sent you on the same route twice. That was a kind 
  of crazy job. It didn't pay so good. The first job I had was delivering newspapers 
  someplace up in the West End. It was a part-time job. That lasted a little . 
  . . . And then I got a job cutting mats. I cut my hand and walked out on that. 
  Fred got a job in a frame shop. So the whole bunch of us that had been in Skowhegan, 
  the whole crowd, ended up working in this crazy frame shop -- Lewinson's. He 
  was sort of like . . . he was a guy who went to City College and he had a lot 
  of theories.</p>
<p>PC: Ended up selling frames.</p>
<p> AK: Making frames. He didn't manufacture frames. He just didn't have the, 
  I don't know, the thing to do it. And I worked for muralists. I worked for Marigliotti 
  and I worked for a guy named Ross and I worked for Allyn Cox, the son of Kenyon 
  Cox.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, really?</p>
<p>AK: They were very interesting experiences. I learned an awful lot working 
  for those guys.</p>
<p>PC: That was very different from working with the trompe l'oeil guy, though, 
  wasn't it?</p>
<p>AK: Marioliotti was like a Venetian painter. He knew what things looked like 
  in places. The style was rough. Ross was like real tight; it was abstract or 
  realistic, but it was very tight. And with Ross I learned what a line was. He 
  had me making forms and he said, &quot;It stinks.&quot; And I got my job with 
  him with paintings that looked like Pollock's. Brought him these wild paintings. 
  And Ross said, &quot;Oh, I see you have some control.&quot; He could understand 
  the very sophisticated word &quot;control.&quot; There wasn't any imagery. But 
  he could look at it and see that my temperament was like a controlled temperament 
  or something -- I don't know how he could see it. He gave me a job. I stretched 
  frames. He had these big canvases 18 x 20 feet and I stretched them for him 
  at first. Later on I got to pounce them. Then later on -- what the hell else 
  did I do there? Oh, I enlarged them for him by art. There's a proper way of 
  doing it. I think by the time I ended he had painted a decorative mural in an 
  apartment on 72nd Street. And twenty years later someone else was getting the 
  apartment and they were going from French blue to Biedermeier green. They wanted 
  the background changed. By this time I had been painting seven or eight years 
  out of art school. And there were violin strings that you had to paint around 
  . And I did it in just one stroke. And his teeth almost fell on the floor. I'd 
  been doing it, you know. I don't know . . . when he found out a little about 
  art history -- knew a little about art history, he sort of warmed up a bit.</p>
<p>PC: Well, you really had kind of a studio training that came along in various 
  lumps and pieces?</p>
<p>PC: Yes. Between that and Skowhegan and tenth Street, it was kind of like a 
  great deal of education.</p>
<p>PC: How long did you work with Cox?</p>
<p> AK: Oh, several years. He had work several months at a time, something like 
  that; sometimes I'd just work for a week. But I think that was the end at that 
  point. It was in 1957. I remember because the woman for whom the mural was being 
  done was Mrs. Dana of the family of the author of Two Years Before the Mast. 
  And I didn't get any paint on the floor at all; it was a real neat job. And 
  I think she thought it wasn't right to tip an artist. She found out I had a 
  show and she went down and bought a collage. I really think that's what happened.</p>
<p>PC: That's marvelous. So you got the idea that you'd do some teaching?</p>
<p>AK: I didn't get the idea.</p>
<p>PC: The job came along.</p>
<p>AK: Well, the first one was at the Brooklyn Museum. That was like the same 
  year I was . . . I was making $35 a week or so for two days in the frame shop. 
  I could get by on that. And they offered me a class for that much for one night 
  or something. I took it. It was a bunch of amateurs. It was awful.</p>
<p>PC: This was your first real teaching?</p>
<p>AK: My first real teaching. Oh, I'd gone up to Camp Green to talk to kids and 
  stuff like that but it wasn't really teaching. I had kind of fun doing it, but, 
  gee, I lost most of that class. Then they offered me a beginner's class and 
  I said, &quot;I'm not going to teach beginners.&quot; I had gotten quite snotty 
  by then. In the beginning when I got out of art school I would have liked to 
  have had a job for $3,000 a year in Wyoming. But by that time I could get by 
  college training. I wasn't going to go any place. Then I got the Yale thing. 
  It paid well. So I took it. It was interesting; it was a challenge. And I got 
  a lot out of it actually.</p>
<p>PC: What did you teach up there?</p>
<p>AK: Painting.</p>
<p>PC: But what levels?</p>
<p>AK: Damned if I know. I mean it ended up being a lot of graduate students as 
  well as undergraduates. They were quite developed intellectually anyway. They 
  were learning how to paint.</p>
<p>PC: Did you find it an interesting experience to carry on with?</p>
<p>AK: Oh, that was interesting for me then. I went up there for almost three 
  years. And I had a very nice time.</p>
<p>PC: Do you still teach?<br>
  <br>
  AK: No. I was supposed to do a seminar at The Studio School this year. I don't 
  know whether I'll do it or not.</p>
<p>PC: . . . group of visiting people . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Group of something -- I don't know. I just don't know what's going on.</p>
<p>PC: I see your name on that list every once in a while.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Well, I taught a class there last year. I had a nice time. I had a 
  lot of fun. I hadn't taught a great deal I guess for three or four years.</p>
<p>PC: It's very different from Yale?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, it's quite different.</p>
<p>PC: How do you like their idea of sort of old atelier . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I think it's kind of nice to have a fine arts painting school, you 
  know, I think it's just absolutely fabulous the adult education that the universities 
  are taking care of. And they do have very fine programs, etc. But I do think 
  it's kind of terrific to have a school for some people who don't give a shit 
  about a degree and want to paint. But I do think there should be professional 
  art schools. </p>
<p>PC: I haven't been to their new building. I saw it when they were on Broadway.</p>
<p>AK: It's gorgeous. It's the old Whitney.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. I'll go and take a look.</p>
<p>AK: Well, it's . . . .</p>
<p>PC: How are their students? Do you find them . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: They're kind of nice. They're a little refined. They're very nice. They're 
  serious as hell. They paint all day. Some of them paint all day and all night 
  five nights a week. They're really serious about painting. That's kind of nice.</p>
<p>PC: It's very interesting that what was once a museum now becomes a place that 
  produces art.</p>
<p> AK: Well, they always used to make art there, too. They had a studio in the 
  back. They had an actual studio there where they did sculpture. You know, the 
  Clay Club. I think that was stuck in the back of the Whitney. And Gertrude Whitney 
  was sort of involved in making it herself.</p>
<p>PC: Right. Do you do much reading? Or did you read books?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I read more than most painters do,</p>
<p>PC: What kind of things do you read? What areas interest you? What authors?</p>
<p>AK: I've always liked cybernetics books, things like that. If they're on a 
  lay level I can get through them. And I like poetry. I've been reading a lot 
  of poetry in the last ten years. People around me. I find it very exciting. 
  And contemporary literature. That's where most of it is as far as I'm concerned. 
  And I read funny biographies and things. I've read a lot of novels.</p>
<p>PC: What kind of poets do you like?</p>
<p>AK: Oh, the New York crowd. You know, Jimmy Schuyler and John Ashbery. I just 
  did this book with John, you know, Fragments.</p>
<p>PC: I haven't seen it yet. I just got something in the mail about it.</p>
<p>AK: [not clear what he said]</p>
<p>PC: The California Press, isn't it?</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: Right. That's what I got in the mail. But you've done a number of books, 
  illustrated them?</p>
<p>AK: I've done book covers. I've done a little book with Kenneth Koch, cartoons 
  and stuff. And I did covers for Bill Berkson, for Kenneth Koch and for Jimmy 
  Schuyler. But actually this is the first . . . .</p>
<p>PC: Are these done specifically for the book?</p>
<p>AK: Right. The whole form is made for the book.</p>
<p>PC: It's a lovely book. I haven't seen it yet.</p>
<p>AK: They've got a three-dollar one and a fifteen-dollar one. This is the fifteen-dollar 
  one.</p>
<p>PC: It's a nice cover. Signed by the artist and the author.</p>
<p> AK: They gave us 250 pieces of paper to sign.</p>
<p>PC: That's a nice book. I love their books. I have quite a number of them.</p>
<p>AK: Well, anyway, John Ashbery's like ice skaters, you know, is one of these 
  really like major stylistic events in literature. It's like very, very exciting 
  to see it.</p>
<p>PC: I haven't read very much of him for some reason.</p>
<p>AK: He's a pretty fabulous stylist. I don't know -- those guys are about as 
  good as poetry gets as far as I'm concerned. It's been very exciting reading.</p>
<p>PC: But did you never get involved with Allen Ginsberg's course on that . . 
  . ?</p>
<p>AK: They all seem like cornballs to me. You know, really, I never thought . 
  . . Ginsberg I guess isn't bad; his course wasn't bad. Ginsberg I always think 
  of like Frank O'Hara. Frank O'Hara was sort of like high art, though. Ginsberg 
  is sort of Barbara, probably Dylan, or something like that.</p>
<p>PC: That's true. They're very close in certain ways.</p>
<p>AK: Barbara, probably; Dylan is pretty good, too. But it isn't really like 
  high art.</p>
<p>PC: Well, it's a lot of show biz.</p>
<p>AK: A lot of show biz, yes. It's all watered down.</p>
<p>PC: You knew O'Hara, didn't you?</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: To get back to reading -- what other kinds of things do you read? Do you 
  read art literature much, the magazines and books?</p>
<p>AK: At one point I was kind of informed. I read the magazines. Now I don't 
  read them as much. I've read a lot of critical writings. I find them interesting.</p>
<p>PC: Is there anybody in particular who interests you?</p>
<p>AK: You mean contemporary? Or old?</p>
<p>PC: Yes, contemporary things.</p>
<p> AK: I liked . . . I think Scott Burden writes lively stuff now. And I think 
  Peter Schjeldahl has a great journalistic style. It's kind of fun.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. His poetry is something.</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: It's so flat-footed sometimes.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. The declarative statement which he uses in his poetry is kind of really 
  sensational.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. Clump. Clump.</p>
<p> AK: Yes. The sentences. There's that whole crowd with Ted Berrigan and Ron 
  Pajet; like the second generation poets that have made something else. He's 
  part of that.</p>
<p>PC: That's interesting. I find the young poets very interesting. Much more 
  so than the fiction writers and the novelists.</p>
<p>AK: Oh, yes. The older guys I guess like Jimmy and Frank and Kenneth and John 
  Ashbery are close to being totally literate. And with a lot of the young guys 
  you don't get the feeling that they are. But they're who they are. And the work 
  seems in a sense more kind of almost American in a way. It's another style, 
  another kind of American . . . .</p>
<p>PC: But they're all -- Schjeldahl is from Minnesota -- but the other guys are 
  from different areas.</p>
<p>AK: Well, he picked up on stuff here and started making the book out there. 
  And all the other guys came from Oklahoma.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. There's that whole Oklahoma school. It's very strange.</p>
<p>AK: But these other guys all went to Harvard. Ken went there, too. They all 
  were at Harvard at the same time. It's kind of crazy.</p>
<p>PC: I didn't know they were Harvard people.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. If you think about it, it makes sense.</p>
<p>PC: That's marvelous. Let me just get back to one art school question.</p>
<p>AK: I like Fairfield Porter's art criticism very much.</p>
<p> PC: Yes.</p>
<p>AK: I think it's terrific.</p>
<p>PC: Did you know him as a painter when he was around?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. We met in the late 1950's. He saw my work in the first show I had. 
  He was interested in my work then. And I'd seen one of his paintings in the 
  Stable Annual. I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>PC: In what way?</p>
<p>AK: I didn't know what the hell to make of it. It looked like a Coca Cola advertisement, 
  you know. And it wasn't. It seemed to be painted good. Then I saw a show of 
  his and got interested. Then he was a friend of Denby's. I met him on the street 
  once. He was again, you know, kind of embarrassed, like a jerky kid. And I said 
  something. (He goes to Maine and I went to Maine.) I said, &quot;Are you going 
  north?&quot; He said, &quot;East.&quot; He corrected me. And I was mad as hell 
  over being so stupid and being corrected. We met years later.</p>
<p>PC: He's very precise.</p>
<p>AK: Very precise. And he remembers everything you say. And I never paid any 
  attention to anything I say let alone what anyone else said. Then we became 
  friends I guess in the late 1950's. He was like very excited about my work. 
  I found his things kind of real interesting.</p>
<p>PC: His paintings I find very difficult sometimes.</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: The way he paints. Sometimes it looks like a sloppy way but it's not really.</p>
<p>AK: The paint is never sloppy. the paint is very controlled. They had that 
  show of Vuillard paintings here in the early 1950's. They had The Dentist and 
  stuff like that. And everyone I knew thought they were shit, particularly the 
  late ones. But I didn't think they were shit. They were like open -- they were 
  open end -- particularly The dentist, the late things. I couldn't get over a 
  guy putting a lifeboat down in the middle of a picture, you know?</p>
<p>PC: Yes. Clunk!</p>
<p> AK: Clunk. And it was all painted beautifully. And then I found out like Fairfield 
  was crazy about him. Jack Tworkov was crazy bout him. Denby was crazy about 
  it. And somehow there was like an open end there. Fairfield was sort of fooling 
  around with that.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. I spent a day with him, not this summer, a year ago. It was very exhausting.</p>
<p>AK: Well, he's very rigorous. He's Harvard, too.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. Out of Chicago.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I saw him this summer swimming a mile a day.</p>
<p>PC: Really! </p>
<p>AK: Yes. He comes to it like this indecent radiant health.</p>
<p>PC: I know. It's incredible, isn't it?</p>
<p>AK: And he tells me he's swimming a mile a day. I don't know how he stands 
  it and painting. And then he says crawl, you know, so I wouldn't get the idea 
  he was using the breast stroke or anything.</p>
<p>PC: Boy! Yes. He's very much like a lot of people I used to know in the Midwest. 
  Healthy and tough about life and things; not soft.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. He's a very rigorous intellectual, too. Literary.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. Right. Are there other artists that you are very good friends with 
  or have been over the years whose ideas interest you?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I guess I've been friends with Al Held since the late . . . as I 
  was with Langlais and Bruback and that crowd. i met Jane and Fairfield and Larry 
  Rivers. The Tanager crowd was Cajori, Ippolito, Philip Pearlstein and George 
  Ortman. And I'm still friends with Philip Perlstein. I find him kind of interesting.</p>
<p>PC: Do you discuss art with these people? Or not?</p>
<p>AK: Sometimes. It depends on who I'm talking with. With someone like Jane Freilicher 
  it's more on a taste level, or how you do it, or something like that. With Al 
  Held and Philip Pearlstein it's all about theories.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, really?</p>
<p> AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: That's interesting.</p>
<p>AK: With Fairfield it's something else. It's taste gain.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, really! </p>
<p>AK: Yes. &quot;Why you like Motherwell; why you don't like Motherwell.&quot;</p>
<p>PC: Oh, I see.</p>
<p>AK: You know?</p>
<p>PC: But Pearlstein has ideas on -- what? His own theories in his own work? 
  Or generally?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. What art should be. A doctrine is pretty important; that kind of formalist 
  thinking.</p>
<p>PC: How about somebody like Sidney Tillim who is all involved with things?</p>
<p>AK: Well, he's not a friend actually. He got interested in my paintings and 
  gave me a lot of bad reviews. He claims he's a friend.</p>
<p>PC: He's got lots of bad reviews to prove it.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. So I don't know. But he's a lot enthused but like most of them came 
  after the pictures were painted. A lot of them, you know. I mean when he first 
  painted it was like painting sort of Matisse . . . .</p>
<p>PC: Geometric.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Geometric and Matisse and Fairfield and, you know, he picked up on 
  Philip somehow. You know, I'm not putting him down as . . . .</p>
<p>PC: I just find it difficult to place him.</p>
<p>AK: He's always been interested in hip ideas. He's sort of a zootsuiter type; 
  I mean that in the est sense. Like he's interested in hip stuff. Wherever it's 
  hip he's there. And he's been involved with figurative stuff, which is kind 
  of strange. But he's never around anything once it's over the hill stylewise.</p>
<p>PC: That's too bad.<br>
  <br>
  AK: Well, he comes on like he's kind of puritan, you know, Old Testament . . 
  . . But it's not true.</p>
<p>PC: I don't know him. I've seen his pictures here and there.</p>
<p>AK: He's a kind of interesting guy. He's wild.</p>
<p>PC: One other question here: Who do you think amongst the teachers you had 
  in art school were important to you? Or were interesting?</p>
<p>AK: I found Henry Varnum Poor quite interesting. I disagreed with most of what 
  he said, I guess. He was kind of interesting because he spoke of painting more 
  on a philosophical level than on a craft level. I found Kantor interesting I 
  guess mostly because it was on a very high craft level.</p>
<p>PC: Kind of a contrast to Poor.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Poor would talk about art more on a philosophical level, more or less, 
  and I found that a more interesting way to think about painting even though 
  I didn't really agree with most of his ideas.</p>
<p>PC: How did you like Skowhegan when you went back to teach there after a period 
  of time?</p>
<p>AK: I had a great time.</p>
<p>PC: Everybody seems to love it up there.</p>
<p>AK: It's a great place.</p>
<p>PC: Healthy out of doors, running around.</p>
<p>AK: Healthy, out of doors. It's like Arcadia. You have nothing on your mind 
  except painting and bringing in meals.</p>
<p>PC: Are there many abstract painters who are up there?</p>
<p>AK: Not really because mostly -- more so now -- because Poor believed in a 
  return to nature and basic truths and stuff like that.</p>
<p>PC: I haven't really got a picture of who the entrenched people were there.</p>
<p> AK: Poor was the founder. And Bill Cummings. And Sidney Simon, And Anne Poor. 
  And there was a sculptor called Kuppa. Poor, he was sort of the philosopher, 
  you know. He was older. He was the one who developed it in those areas intellectually.</p>
<p>PC: That makes a lot of sense with some of the other things.</p>
<p>AK: Once you get that clear that gives everything, the whole picture. And you 
  read a little bit about it. You might have two or three paragraphs of small 
  stuff sometimes on what they're about. That's what it is.</p>
<p>PC: I see. Well, who do you think is important to you in the development of 
  your painting as far as the realization of it in the sense that -- I mean excluding 
  yourself -- but I mean outside people?</p>
<p>AK: My dealers!</p>
<p>PC: Some dealers!</p>
<p>AK: Till they get the stuff moving! No -- I don't know -- when I was on tenth 
  Street, it was like the Tanager.</p>
<p>PC: It was really the groups.</p>
<p>AK: Yes, the groups where I went. I got more directly from the guys.</p>
<p>PC: I never really learn how to phrase this question properly. What's the quality 
  that makes you paint? In the sense of . . . is it a drive to communicate? Or 
  to make things? Or . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Well, it varies; it changes. It has changed. It started out just as a kick.</p>
<p>PC: Something that was fun?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. It was more than fun; it was a big kick. And then it got to be like 
  a desire to change everyone's idea of what a painting is or what the world looks 
  like. You know, it's going to insanity.</p>
<p>PC: So that it's kind of a messianic point at this stage?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. It's got quite out of hand.</p>
<p>PC: Well, the Flowers -- look what's happened!</p>
<p>AK: Yes. That's the way a flower looks and that's the way a painting is supposed 
  to look. That's kind of, you know I hardly drew them -- even after I'd been 
  painting for several years. I mean that kind of presumptuous ego just seemed 
  very distasteful to me.<br>
  <br>
  PC: But I think the artist has to have an ego in a sense.</p>
<p>AK: Well, mine was late in coming.</p>
<p>PC: Is it making up for lost time?</p>
<p>AK: It sure has I think.</p>
<p>PC: We talked about making a living and stuff, didn't we? Have you done any 
  traveling since? Have you been in Europe? or have you gone any place besides 
  Maine?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, I've just started to move around. I went to Europe for fourteen days 
  to look at the work at Spoleto for ten. I spent six day in Paris which was kind 
  of interesting.</p>
<p>PC: When was this?</p>
<p>AK: Four or five years ago. It was really terrific to see the Louvre and to 
  see the old pictures and to see the new scenery.</p>
<p>PC: Do you like traveling? Do you want to do some more?</p>
<p>AK: Not for any length of time. I like to go some place for a couple of days. 
  I wouldn't mind going back to Europe for a week or two, but not an extensive 
  trip.</p>
<p>PC: Did you have any particular heroes when you were young, you know, an art 
  student, like art heroes or culture heroes?</p>
<p>AK: Well, culture heroes were like Lester Young and Billie Holliday, I guess, 
  were real big culture heroes. They were all in jazz pretty much. Then when I 
  became a painter, after a while, you know, they would be people who were painters. 
  I thought Matisse was a great painter; I thought of him as a culture hero. I 
  thought of Bill de Kooning as a culture hero. And Frank Kline.</p>
<p>PC: But not Matisse?</p>
<p>AK: Not really; he was like something else. But after a while, you know, you 
  get him as that.</p>
<p>PC: That's fascinating. How did you see de Kooning as a culture hero then?</p>
<p>AK: Well, it's like a transfer from the jazz hero, you know, more or less.</p>
<p>PC: Do you go to all the jazz spots?</p>
<p> AK: Before the college kids came into it. Which was very early.</p>
<p>PC: Now they're everywhere.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. We used to follow Dixieland in art school. Then we followed the progressive 
  stuff for a while. Then we followed the Afro-Cuban stuff. Then it just got like 
  boring.</p>
<p>PC: Do you have an interest in politics?</p>
<p>AK: No.</p>
<p>PC: Nothing?</p>
<p>AK: Nothing.</p>
<p>PC: You don't design posters? Or do all those things?</p>
<p>AK: I'll give away a painting or something like that. But I really don't care 
  about it much.</p>
<p>PC: Do you have any other interests like hobbies or things besides reading 
  poetry?</p>
<p>AK: No.</p>
<p>PC: Nothing additional like that. Have you done any . . . ? You paint in oils? 
  You don't use acrylics?</p>
<p>AK: No. I still use oils.</p>
<p>PC: You haven't gone into any of the new materials?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I cut out of aluminum. That's about as far as it goes.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. But you haven't tried the acrylics? Or . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Well, they wouldn't be any good for me because I use blended toner. I like 
  the oil colors better.</p>
<p>PC: You're still doing cutouts, aren't you?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I'm having a big show in about two years, you know, the tables.</p>
<p>PC: Standing . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: And I'm doing a whole bunch more. I'm going to be doing them all winter.<br>
  <br>
  PC: What's the name of the large painting, do you know?</p>
<p>AK: Private Domain. It's the name of a dance. I get a big kick out of dance. 
  Paul Taylor. And I like Merce Cunningham.</p>
<p>PC: Have you done other things for the dance besides the Paul Taylor thing?</p>
<p>AK: I did about seven or eight costumes and sets for Paul Taylor.</p>
<p>PC: That's terrific. I haven't seen any of those in years and years and years.</p>
<p>AK: Well, we did one new one where I put the stage in front of the dancers 
  and you could peep at them through these rectangulars; they were behind them. 
  We got away with it. It was terrific.</p>
<p>PC: How did it work?</p>
<p>AK: It worked out fine. They were all surprised.</p>
<p>PC: Great! Well, you've gotten very involved in designing sets.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Well, they're like sort of very great artists. And somehow like the 
  poets and things it's something that really rings bells or just don't follow 
  it.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. That's true. Are you interested in any other dance? Or just those 
  particular people? I mean do you go to ballet?</p>
<p>AK: No. I go to it occasionally. Denby will tell me what to go see at city 
  Center. That would be terrific. But I'm not a real dance fan.</p>
<p>PC: You don't go to the Hamptons either in the summers?</p>
<p>AK: No, I go to Maine.</p>
<p>PC: Where do you go up there?</p>
<p>AK: We have a place out in Lincolnville.</p>
<p>PC: Where is that?</p>
<p> AK: Well, no place. It's halfway between Portland and Bar Harbor up in the 
  mountains. We're on a lake. We've been going there for fifteen years or something 
  like that. I originally wanted to paint landscapes so that was the reason for 
  staying in the country summers. I like painting outdoors. That was like a big 
  thing. And I like being out of seeing a lot of people part of the year.</p>
<p>PC: Get out and breathe a little.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. They say it's civilized to retreat.</p>
<p>PC: Let's get back to some of the exhibitions. When did you get involved with 
  Thibaut -- or it was Fischbach?</p>
<p>AK: In 1962. They came down to my studio I guess; well, Marilyn had seen my 
  show at the Tanager and couldn't make up her mind about it. She knew it was 
  something that she was interested in. Then they came down to my studio. I had 
  that big of cutouts and advertising stuff. And I did a whole bunch of windows. 
  And I was also doing a man drinking beer. This was in 1962, I guess - 1961 or 
  1962. And they wanted to buy the whole studio out. I told them to forget about 
  it. I sold them a painting. Then I had that altercation, you know, after I had 
  that show and Martha Jackson bought the stuff and Eleanor Ward who I had two 
  shows with was furious.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. She would be.</p>
<p>AK: And she asked me to leave the gallery. Her parting words were something: 
  &quot;Whoever gets you is going to clean up. but I can't help it.&quot;</p>
<p>PC: She's really incredible. She makes her mind up and that's it.</p>
<p>AK: That was it. And she was right. Because we never sold anything there. And 
  about that time I started to sell like crazy. And there was just something very 
  interesting about Marilyn and Yvonne. It was the thing like they were people 
  who were committed to new things and were open. Most of the stuff they had was 
  tachieste stuff which you knew they wouldn't have long.</p>
<p>PC: They got rid of it quickly.</p>
<p>AK: Right. It was like open. It seemed like there was a lot of energy there. 
  And they seemed to really dig my work. That was the big thing. That's what I 
  wanted. It worked out very well.</p>
<p>PC: That's terrific. I remember the windows. How did they get started?</p>
<p> AK: Well, I'd always painted like . . . see this painting here has windows 
  in the back.</p>
<p>PC: Right.</p>
<p>AK: One day I just looked out the window and just decided I was going to paint 
  a window. And it was like dealing with a person as an abstraction. So it became 
  a window as an abstraction. The idea of the window, you see. And I painted like 
  from the landscapes I'd paint the same minute. You know, at twelve-thirty I'd 
  paint a picture. And what I'd do is paint small pictures. And when I made a 
  clear image I'd paint a large one. I wanted to see how long I could sustain 
  it. I did it with the figure. Then I wanted to try one with the window. I did 
  it for a whole year. Just painted windows. And they all ended up being different 
  colors. It was a very interesting year.</p>
<p>PC: How do you mean when you got a clear image you'd do a large one?</p>
<p>AK: Well, you'd do one. Or if you do three or four of them sometimes the image 
  would be clearer of what you're about. Or it would start out sort of like not 
  clear.</p>
<p>PC: So they were -- what? Like studies? Or . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Yes, studies. Right.</p>
<p>PC: But you don't do drawings or studies for the paintings usually, do you?</p>
<p>AK: No. Those come from life sketches. Still it's the same idea of life. But 
  with these large flowers and large people I have to draw them on the canvas. 
  And that takes a lot of time. The way I work now is very fluid. It's much more 
  preparation than I used to have. I used to just take a six-by-eight canvas and 
  paint it.</p>
<p>PC: I mean like that was very . . . .</p>
<p>AK: Direct. I just took it out in the field and painted it.</p>
<p>PC: Zap!</p>
<p>AK: Zap! And it worked out.</p>
<p>PC: But how about the roses then? Which are huge.</p>
<p> AK: Well, the roses . . . . I did a whole bunch of sketches and finally got 
  an image that looked good and then carefully blew it up. It took about maybe 
  a week to work up the drawing and very carefully mixed the colors and painted 
  it. Zap! It was painted in the same way. The painting took longer but not that 
  much longer. And I can control it much more.</p>
<p>PC: Do you make a lot of drawings?</p>
<p>AK: No. If I'm stuck or something, if I can't get it right, I'll go make some 
  drawings. But I don't make drawings for the hell of it.</p>
<p>PC: They're really working drawings then?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Working drawings. They're usually not much. Every so often I get something 
  that looks a little like a drawing. But I think I drew so much at art school 
  that I filled up a whole closetful of drawings.</p>
<p>PC: That was enough.</p>
<p>AK: One day I said, &quot;I'm not going to draw any more. It just gets in the 
  way of my painting.&quot; I just didn't draw again.</p>
<p>PC: That's interesting. You know, the whole thing breaks down into people who 
  draw a lot, people who draw a little bit, and then there are people who drew 
  and don't except once in a while.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I like to have a very rigorous drawing background, you know, and found 
  like a weakness in my painting. Well, they were kind of linear and held the 
  line. So I got rid of my drawing for seven or eight years. You see, these things 
  have a lot of drawing in them now. But it's all buried underneath the paint.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, I see. How would you start a large canvas like The Roses?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I'd make the sketches and try to get an image that I like. I'd very 
  carefully enlarge it. And every line is questioned and moved and altered and 
  stuff like that; it's done very slowly. And then when the drawing, the linear 
  thing, looks pretty good, I mix up the colors, you know, like the colors are 
  mixed and mixed into other colors. It's quite complicated. But it's done very 
  slowly.</p>
<p>PC: I always think of your paintings as like you have to look to see some of 
  the strokes.</p>
<p>AK: Well, the idea is a fluid surface. I can't stand laying a donkey leg on 
  the canvas. It just drives me crazy to see labor exposed. I always try for an 
  instantaneous . . . .<br>
  <br>
  PC: Ease.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Well, the whole image is supposed to come off real quickly. And I 
  think my brushwork has gotten more contained for the image, you know.</p>
<p>PC: How many shows . . . ? You've had - what? A couple of shows at Fischbach, 
  haven't you?</p>
<p>AK: I don't know how many shows I've had. I've had two in the new place and 
  like four in the old place. I've had six shows with them.</p>
<p>PC: The paintings keep getting larger and larger.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I'll get myself out of that place.</p>
<p>PC: What do you do with a canvas the size of that?</p>
<p>AK: Danged if I know. It's not my problem.</p>
<p>PC: That's how big?</p>
<p>AK: It's ten by twenty-two. But you couldn't decorate a synagogue with it.</p>
<p>PC: Have you done any other commissions like that? important commissions?</p>
<p>AK: That's not a commission.</p>
<p>PC: No, but I mean . . . I don't know why I said that.</p>
<p>AK: It's a little speculation.</p>
<p>PC: Have you done any commissions?</p>
<p>AK: I've done some portrait commissions. I manage to get one a year or so.</p>
<p>PC: Do you like them?</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: Are they people you know? Or not?</p>
<p>AK: Generally it's someone I know casually.</p>
<p>PC: Have you done anybody cold?</p>
<p>AK: I did two kids cold.</p>
<p> PC: How did it work?</p>
<p>AK: It turned out to be pretty good. It was like a little hairy.</p>
<p>PC: But you like doing one very so often?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. My technique now is like . . . in the formal working my technique 
  is quite proficient. So portrait like a likeness is absolutely no problem, you 
  know. And the people commissioning them are happy -- they want it in my form. 
  So it's generally no problem. I won't do it in like something like a new form. 
  I'll do it in a form that I've worked out. You know, like it took about two 
  years to work out the flower form. If I start on a figurative, say, where I'm 
  doing something that I haven't done before, it might take that long to work 
  out. It would be nuts to try to do a portrait.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. What would you say is your main interest or the central interest or 
  idea that you're driving at or developing?</p>
<p>AK: Well, it's changed and altered over a period of time. I've been painting 
  direct sensations. Now at this point they're quite indirect sensations. I guess 
  it's an idea of, as I said before, what things look like, what a painting should 
  look like. My means are what color is it, you know, it's like the means have 
  to do with the proportion, the scale, or getting the right kind of color in 
  the edges. But those are technical things really.</p>
<p>PC: But I mean have you developed a theory behind your paintings? Or not?</p>
<p>AK: Well, that's sort of the theory.</p>
<p>PC: But that's come after the pictures, hasn't it?</p>
<p>AK: No. It's that you sort of get forced out of things into other things.</p>
<p>PC: You do something and you change it?</p>
<p> AK: Well, you paint this kind of picture and you want to paint . . . it seems 
  like why can't you paint a figurative picture that's as big as like a big abstract 
  picture. Then it becomes like, well, if you paint it life-size, it's like little 
  figures on a big canvas, you know. So I decided the hell with it; let's try 
  something else. Like those old ones. At one point I said . . . well, basically 
  the idea of the scale is Velasquez, the proportion of the figure to the outside 
  perimeter. I say I don't want to do anything like that anymore. I'm tired of 
  it. So you just like go on to something else.</p>
<p>PC: The one with the dancers is a whole new kind of thing going on.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. It's a whole other thing, sort of like . . . .</p>
<p>PC: front back</p>
<p>AK: Right. Well, you find a lot of pictures that are just sort of . . . you 
  look at a lot of pictures that look real good and they're all using kind of 
  like a flat impressionist space. So you wonder what the possibilities are of 
  going into space with volumes.</p>
<p>PC: It's a reaction against that shallow . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. That kind of impression space. And it's a thing that occurs not only 
  to me but also to other painters. And people do it in different ways. It's almost 
  like a medical thing, you know, where there's a problem and a solution, you 
  know. There are different people working toward a solution at the same time. 
  That's like a part of what I'm involved in; it certainly isn't the whole thing. 
  Part of it is a sort of biographical form too, you know.</p>
<p>PC: In what way?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I paint friends. So it's autobiographical. So it's a whole other 
  thing.</p>
<p>PC: So it's like a diary or something?</p>
<p>AK: It's sort of a diary, I guess.</p>
<p>PC: Things that happened to people.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. To people five years apart, you know. Things like that.</p>
<p>PC: Do you have friends that you've painted two or three times over the years?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Some of them go back ten years. Some go back five years.</p>
<p>PC: I mean you've painted them three or four times?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I like to do them over again.</p>
<p> PC: That's interesting. Do they change a great deal?</p>
<p>AK: Well, they're always being painted in a different form, you know, so it 
  always changes, and they change.</p>
<p>PC: That's very interesting. Are you interested in them on the psychological 
  point of view? Or . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I think when you're dealing with people, you can't avoid a psychological 
  thing. But the thing of appearances to me, what a thing appears to be, is like 
  always a mystery and it's like a brand new situation. That's always been very 
  exciting whether you can come up to this new situation and face it, you know?</p>
<p>PC: Yes. Even if it's something you know, it changes?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Well, it's like you look at yourself in the mirror and you have to 
  adapt to that new face you see.</p>
<p>PC: Every morning.</p>
<p>AK: Every morning, right. Or you can just forget about it and catch up with 
  it every ten years. Or you can forget about it entirely.</p>
<p>PC: That's marvelous. What kind of projects do you have set for yourself? Or 
  are you just working away?</p>
<p>AK: Well, no. I'm working on these cutouts. It's very sensitive the way I work. 
  You have a project and work on it for a couple of years. These cutout things 
  I started ten years ago. I decided to go into them again several years ago. 
  They've opened up new areas and I'm just going into them. </p>
<p>PC: How do you do them? Do you make drawings and paint? Or do you paint them 
  afterwards?</p>
<p>AK: The old ones were done . . . I painted them and cut them out. They were 
  rough and ready. These things are drawn first. You've seen them?</p>
<p>PC: Yes. I saw . . . .</p>
<p>AK: And then I paint them afterwards, after they're cut out; they're cut out 
  and the edges are finished.</p>
<p>PC: So you make a drawing first?</p>
<p>AK: Right on the metal.</p>
<p> PC: Oh, I see. And then you cut it out and then paint it?</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: Is that going to be a group of people? Or what kind of . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: I'm going to show a bunch of stuff in Milwaukee in an illusionistic, figurative, 
  environmental show more or less; I don't know what it's about. Anyway, I'll 
  have a room and I'm going to show maybe a lot of old stuff and maybe a new table 
  and maybe some of this stuff. I don't know how it'll work in.</p>
<p>PC: How did the idea of the table develop?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I did these little things. When I first thought of those things in 
  reverse scale -- went down to about twelve inches small cutouts. And I wanted 
  to show them and to put each one of them on a stand seemed absurd. And they 
  looked real good sitting on the floor but you couldn't see the painting. So 
  I figured where you could see the painting was four feet high. And four feet 
  high they looked terrific. But when I saw them at that height -- I had been 
  working on The Cocktail Party that's down there, the great big one -- I wanted 
  to do an environmental piece out of that. The only idea I had was to cut them 
  out and bring them into the room. And it was like a klutzy idea. But I was looking 
  for something. And then about four or five months after that show it just went 
  click! And I saw it. I saw that was the height. And that that was The Cocktail 
  Party again.</p>
<p>PC: Right. How did that painting come about? The Cocktail Party?</p>
<p>AK: I wanted to paint a composition. Of course people don't paint compositions 
  in the 20th Century much. And I wanted to use overlapping forms because people 
  don't. And I had to use something that was part of my life. I mean I couldn't 
  paint angels or people in Vietnam, stuff like that. So a cocktail party is a 
  place where there are gestures, you know. And I did groups. It took about two 
  or three years to get to it. The first was a dance group -- Paul Taylor. Then 
  it was an outdoor group with Marie Burkhardt and Red Grooms and that crowd outdoors. 
  Then I did an indoor cocktail party, you know. I compressed the figures and 
  overlapped them and then I did the big one. The Lawn Party painting.</p>
<p>PC: The big painting is the next step?</p>
<p> AK; Yes. The big painting is the next step in that idea. You see, the flowers 
  are an extension of that. They're all overlapping volumes. With everything you 
  do, like The Cocktail Party, what I found was slightly weak about it was each 
  face was very different and didn't have the fluidity.</p>
<p>PC: You mean the total . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Fluid quality that I wanted. Now I saw The Lawn Party out west this summer. 
  I don't apologize for that painting, you know. It's got terrific light. And 
  it controls more than those paintings outdoor and indoor and it has terrific 
  light. But the proportions are as developed as this and it has more stops in 
  it. So I did the Flowers for a couple of years and got I think a little more 
  proficient in doing an all-over kind of thing.</p>
<p>PC: How did they start, the Flowers? Because I remember . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Well, I quit the Flowers for a long time. In the 1950's I did Flowers. 
  And I quit them because you'd stick them in a vase and make an all-over pattern 
  and that was it. I did a painting of flowers, a bunch of flowers and you can 
  see a farmhouse through the flowers; sort of about the worst idea you could 
  think of. Just for the hell of it. It was a lousy painting that I threw away. 
  Then the next summer I found it and I figured there was something there I wanted. 
  And I did the flowers and closed the space down, just did the space around it 
  like in these flowers which eventually I was able to blow up to about 32 x 48. 
  And I figured I'm going to see what I can do with flowers. It took maybe about 
  a year after that before I got the first pictures.</p>
<p>PC: It's interesting how one looks at things differently after a period of 
  time.</p>
<p>AK: What do you mean?</p>
<p>PC: Well, you know, like the old paintings you picked out.</p>
<p>AK: Well, yes. Well, there was a reason for doing that painting; I knew that. 
  And, you know, you should work out of your own work. Even out of your own bad 
  pictures. Sometimes it doesn't do you any good to look at any good pictures.</p>
<p>PC: In what sense?</p>
<p>AK: Well, after you've done enough; after I've painted a figure for three or 
  four years, you just want to do something else, try something else.<br>
  <br>
  PC: Variety.</p>
<p>AK: Yes.</p>
<p>PC: Let's see, you've been in all kinds of museum shows and stuff like that. 
  Have any of them been important to you or interested you particularly?</p>
<p>AK: The collage show at The Museum of Modern Art was the real big show for 
  me. Because my work was put up with the best light it was the first time anybody 
  took me seriously as a collage artist. It was a terrific break to get my work 
  up on the same wall with the other guys. That was the biggest thing. And I think 
  they always show just a couple of pictures of mine at the Whitney. They were 
  a big deal for me, too.</p>
<p>PC: That was that &quot;Young . . . .?&quot;</p>
<p>AK; No, that wasn't. Later they bought one . . . . They didn't buy it; it was 
  given to them. It was like a big helmet. They put that out last year. And there 
  was one in the Annual, too. Those have been things that have meant something 
  to me.</p>
<p>PC: It's interesting that sometimes a museum show more than a one-man show 
  because it will do something.</p>
<p>AK: Well, it puts your pictures in another context.</p>
<p>PC: Yes. We have a few minutes left. Are there any things you think we should 
  talk about that I haven't brought up?</p>
<p>AK: I can't think of any.</p>
<p>PC: We've been going on here for over two hours, I guess. But you liked doing 
  Fragments -- right?</p>
<p>AK: It's a challenge. There was some guy from France who was doing publicity. 
  He brought us together actually. He sort of like thought of it. John brought 
  me this poem. And it was a fantastic challenge. The poem is like disconnected 
  pieces and it has no narrative line.</p>
<p>PC: Oh, it's just these . . . ?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. It has like clashing images. So I decided . . . my idea was to make 
  just a lot of images that just flashed. And then I didn't know in what style 
  to do it because I don't make stuff like that. It took quite a while to work 
  it out.</p>
<p> PC: How did you like working with the Black Sparrow people?</p>
<p>AK: Well, they're okay. The correspondence is all kind of very peculiar, or 
  casual or something -- I don't know.</p>
<p>PC: That's interesting. They really make very nice books though.</p>
<p>AK: Yes. I think they're very serious about it. They did a good job on it. 
  I like the type very much that they selected.</p>
<p>PC: Yes.</p>
<p>AK: Have you ever worked with them? You're a poet, aren't you?</p>
<p>PC: No, no. But I read a lot of poets. It's one of my great interests. Okay. 
  Let's see, I don't think there's anything else. You haven't had any exhibitions 
  in Europe or anything like that?</p>
<p>AK: Yes. Well, no, that one work has been there. The collage show was there 
  in Spoleto. I've been in other shows there.</p>
<p>PC: How have you been received there? Do you know?</p>
<p>AK: I have no idea. I think they usually abide by intellectual programs and 
  my stuff is like out in left field compared to the programs.</p>
<p>PC: It doesn't follow . . . . Okay. Well, let's stop.</p>
