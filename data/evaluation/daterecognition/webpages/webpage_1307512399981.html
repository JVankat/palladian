              8th Infantry, 4th Infantry Division Place and date: Hurtgen Forest 
              near Schevenhutte, Germany, 20 November 1944. Entered service at: 
              Sumter, S.C. Birth: Sumter, SC G.O. No.: 77, September 1945. Citation: 
              He was commanding the 2d Battalion, 8th Infantry, in an attack through 
              the Hurtgen Forest near Schevenhutte, Germany, on 20 November 1944. 
              During the early phases of the assault, the leading elements of 
              his battalion were halted by a minefield and immobilized by heavy 
              hostile fire. Advancing alone into the mined area, Col. Mabry established 
              a safe route of passage. He then moved ahead of the foremost scouts, 
              personally leading the attack, until confronted by a boobytrapped 
              double concertina obstacle. With the assistance of the scouts, he 
              disconnected the explosives and cut a path through the wire. Upon 
              moving through the opening, he observed 3 enemy in foxholes whom 
              he captured at bayonet point. Driving steadily forward he paced 
              the assault against 3 log bunkers which housed mutually supported 
              automatic weapons. Racing up a slope ahead of his men, he found 
              the initial bunker deserted, then pushed on to the second where 
              he was suddenly confronted by 9 onrushing enemy. Using the butt 
              of his rifle, he felled 1 adversary and bayoneted a second, before 
              his scouts came to his aid and assisted him in overcoming the others 
              in hand-to-hand combat. Accompanied by the riflemen, he charged 
              the third bunker under pointblank small arms fire and led the way 
              into the fortification from which he prodded 6 enemy at bayonet 
              point. Following the consolidation of this area, he led his battalion 
              across 300 yards of fire-swept terrain to seize elevated ground 
              upon which he established a defensive position which menaced the 
              enemy on both flanks, and provided his regiment a firm foothold 
              on the approach to the Cologne Plain. Col. Mabry's superlative courage, 
              daring, and leadership in an operation of major importance exemplify 
              the finest characteristics of the military service.

              He led a squad when his unit moved forward in darkness to meet the 
              threat of a breakthrough by elements of the 17th German Panzer Grenadier 
              Division. Assigned to protect the left flank, he discovered hostile 
              troops digging in. As he reported this information, several German 
              machineguns opened fire, stopping the American advance. Knowing 
              the position of the enemy, Sgt. MacGillivary volunteered to knock 
              out 1 of the guns while another company closed in from the right 
              to assault the remaining strong points. He circled from the left 
              through woods and snow, carefully worked his way to the emplacement 
              and shot the 2 camouflaged gunners at a range of 3 feet as other 
              enemy forces withdrew. Early in the afternoon of the same day, Sgt. 
              MacGillivary was dispatched on reconnaissance and found that Company 
              I was being opposed by about 6 machineguns reinforcing a company 
              of fanatically fighting Germans. His unit began an attack but was 
              pinned down by furious automatic and small arms fire. With a clear 
              idea of where the enemy guns were placed, he voluntarily embarked 
              on a lone combat patrol. Skillfully taking advantage of all available 
              cover, he stalked the enemy, reached a hostile machinegun and blasted 
              its crew with a grenade. He picked up a submachine gun from the 
              battlefield and pressed on to within 10 yards of another machinegun, 
              where the enemy crew discovered him and feverishly tried to swing 
              their weapon into line to cut him down. He charged ahead, jumped 
              into the midst of the Germans and killed them with several bursts. 
              Without hesitation, he moved on to still another machinegun, creeping, 
              crawling, and rushing from tree to tree, until close enough to toss 
              a grenade into the emplacement and close with its defenders. He 
              dispatched this crew also, but was himself seriously wounded. Through 
              his indomitable fighting spirit, great initiative, and utter disregard 
              for personal safety in the face of powerful enemy resistance, Sgt. 
              MacGillivary destroyed four hostile machineguns and immeasurably 
              helped his company to continue on its mission with minimum casualties.

              He displayed conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond 
              the call of duty when his company was pinned down by heavy artillery, 
              mortar, and small arms fire, near Castel d'Aiano, Italy. Volunteering 
              to act as a scout, armed with only a rifle, he charged headlong 
              into withering fire, killing 2 Germans and wounding 3 in order to 
              capture a machinegun. Carrying this enemy weapon across an open 
              field through heavy fire, he neutralized 2 more machinegun nests; 
              he then circled behind 4 other Germans, killing them with a burst 
              as they were firing on his company. Spotting another dangerous enemy 
              position to this right, he knelt with the machinegun in his arms 
              and exchanged fire with the Germans until he had killed 2 and wounded 
              3. The enemy now poured increased mortar and artillery fire on the 
              company's newly won position. Pfc. Magrath fearlessly volunteered 
              again to brave the shelling in order to collect a report of casualties. 
              Heroically carrying out this task, he made the supreme sacrifice--a 
              climax to the valor and courage that are in keeping with highest 
              traditions of the military service.

              distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry above and beyond 
              the call of duty. On 18 September 1944, in the vicinity of Best., 
              Holland, his platoon, attempting to seize the bridge across the 
              Wilhelmina Canal, was surrounded and isolated by an enemy force 
              greatly superior in personnel and firepower. Acting as lead scout, 
              Pfc. Mann boldly crept to within rocket-launcher range of an enemy 
              artillery position and, in the face of heavy enemy fire, destroyed 
              an 88mm. gun and an ammunition dump. Completely disregarding the 
              great danger involved, he remained in his exposed position, and, 
              with his M-1 rifle, killed the enemy one by one until he was wounded 
              4 times. Taken to a covered position, he insisted on returning to 
              a forward position to stand guard during the night. On the following 
              morning the enemy launched a concerted attack and advanced to within 
              a few yards of the position, throwing hand grenades as they approached. 
              One of these landed within a few feet of Pfc. Mann. Unable to raise 
              his arms, which were bandaged to his body, he yelled "grenade" and 
              threw his body over the grenade, and as it exploded, died. His outstanding 
              gallantry above and beyond the call of duty and his magnificent 
              conduct were an everlasting inspiration to his comrades for whom 
              he gave his life.

              For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life 
              above and beyond the call of duty as platoon leader attached to 
              Company C, 5th Pioneer Battalion, 5th Marine Division, in action 
              against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, 26 March 
              1945. With his sector of the 5th Pioneer Battalion bivouac area 
              penetrated by a concentrated enemy attack launched a few minutes 
              before dawn, 1st Lt. Martin instantly organized a firing line with 
              the marines nearest his foxhole and succeeded in checking momentarily 
              the headlong rush of the Japanese. Determined to rescue several 
              of his men trapped in positions overrun by the enemy, he defied 
              intense hostile fire to work his way through the Japanese to the 
              surrounded marines. Although sustaining 2 severe wounds, he blasted 
              the Japanese who attempted to intercept him, located his beleaguered 
              men and directed them to their own lines. When 4 of the infiltrating 
              enemy took possession of an abandoned machinegun pit and subjected 
              his sector to a barrage of hand grenades, 1st Lt. Martin, alone 
              and armed only with a pistol, boldly charged the hostile position 
              and killed all of its occupants. Realizing that his few remaining 
              comrades could not repulse another organized attack, he called to 
              his men to follow and then charged into the midst of the strong 
              enemy force, firing his weapon and scattering them until he fell, 
              mortally wounded by a grenade. By his outstanding valor, indomitable 
              fighting spirit and tenacious determination in the face of overwhelming 
              odds, 1st Lt. Martin permanently disrupted a coordinated Japanese 
              attack and prevented a greater loss of life in his own and adjacent 
              platoons. His inspiring leadership and unswerving devotion to duty 
              reflect the highest credit upon himself and the U.S. Naval Service. 
              He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.

              No.: 71, 27 October 1943. Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and 
              intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action with the 
              enemy. Over a period of several days, repeated efforts to drive 
              the enemy from a key defensive position high in the snow-covered 
              precipitous mountains between East Arm Holtz Bay and Chichagof Harbor 
              had failed. On 26 May 1943, troop dispositions were readjusted and 
              a trial coordinated attack on this position by a reinforced battalion 
              was launched. Initially successful, the attack hesitated. In the 
              face of severe hostile machinegun, rifle, and mortar fire, Pvt. 
              Martinez, an automatic rifleman, rose to his feet and resumed his 
              advance. Occasionally he stopped to urge his comrades on. His example 
              inspired others to follow. After a most difficult climb, Pvt. Martinez 
              eliminated resistance from part of the enemy position by BAR fire 
              and hand grenades, thus assisting the advance of other attacking 
              elements. This success only partially completed the action. The 
              main Holtz-Chichagof Pass rose about 150 feet higher, flanked by 
              steep rocky ridges and reached by a snow-filled defile. Passage 
              was barred by enemy fire from either flank and from tiers of snow 
              trenches in front. Despite these obstacles, and knowing of their 
              existence, Pvt. Martinez again led the troops on and up, personally 
              silencing several trenches with BAR fire and ultimately reaching 
              the pass itself. Here, just below the knifelike rim of the pass, 
              Pvt. Martinez encountered a final enemy-occupied trench and as he 
              was engaged in firing into it he was mortally wounded. The pass, 
              however, was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary 
              to the end of organized hostile resistance on the island.

              in action against the enemy in connection with a bombing mission 
              over enemy-occupied Europe on 20 February 1944. The aircraft on 
              which Sgt. Mathies was serving as engineer and ball turret gunner 
              was attacked by a squadron of enemy fighters with the result that 
              the copilot was killed outright, the pilot wounded and rendered 
              unconscious, the radio operator wounded and the plane severely damaged. 
              Nevertheless, Sgt. Mathies and other members of the crew managed

              they contacted the control tower and reported the situation. Sgt.

              Other members of the crew were ordered to jump, leaving Sgt. Mathies 
              and the navigator aboard. After observing the distressed aircraft 
              from another plane, Sgt. Mathies' commanding officer decided the 
              damaged plane could not be landed by the inexperienced crew and 
              ordered them to abandon it and parachute to safety. Demonstrating 
              unsurpassed courage and heroism, Sgt. Mathies and the navigator 
              replied that the pilot was still alive but could not be moved and

              the call of duty in action with the enemy over Vegesack, Germany, 
              on 18 March 1943. 1st Lt. Mathis, as leading bombardier of his squadron, 
              flying through intense and accurate antiaircraft fire, was just 
              starting his bomb run, upon which the entire squadron depended for 
              accurate bombing, when he was hit by the enemy antiaircraft fire. 
              His right arm was shattered above the elbow, a large wound was torn 
              in his side and abdomen, and he was knocked from his bomb sight 
              to the rear of the bombardier's compartment. Realizing that the 
              success of the mission depended upon him, 1st Lt. Mathis, by sheer 
              determination and willpower, though mortally wounded, dragged himself 
              back to his sights, released his bombs, then died at his post of

              a perfect attack against the enemy. 1st Lt. Mathis' undaunted bravery

              on 7 September 1944, near Besancon, France. Technician 5th Grade 
              Maxwell and 3 other soldiers, armed only with .45 caliber automatic 
              pistols, defended the battalion observation post against an overwhelming 
              onslaught by enemy infantrymen in approximately platoon strength, 
              supported by 20mm. flak and machinegun fire, who had infiltrated 
              through the battalion's forward companies and were attacking the 
              observation post with machinegun, machine pistol, and grenade fire 
              at ranges as close as 10 yards. Despite a hail of fire from automatic 
              weapons and grenade launchers, Technician 5th Grade Maxwell aggressively 
              fought off advancing enemy elements and, by his calmness, tenacity, 
              and fortitude, inspired his fellows to continue the unequal struggle. 
              When an enemy hand grenade was thrown in the midst of his squad, 
              Technician 5th Grade Maxwell unhesitatingly hurled himself squarely

              He gallantly maintained a 3-day stand in the face of terrible odds 
              when American troops fought for possession of the rugged slopes 
              of legusuku-Yama on Ie Shima, Ryukyu Islands. After placing his 
              heavy machinegun in an advantageous yet vulnerable position on a 
              ridge to support riflemen, he became the target of fierce mortar 
              and small arms fire from counterattacking Japanese. He repulsed 
              this assault by sweeping the enemy with accurate bursts while explosions 
              and ricocheting bullets threw blinding dust and dirt about him. 
              He broke up a second counterattack by hurling grenades into the 
              midst of the enemy forces, and then refused to withdraw, volunteering 
              to maintain his post and cover the movement of American riflemen 
              as they reorganized to meet any further hostile action. The major 
              effort of the enemy did not develop until the morning of 21 April. 
              It found Pfc. May still supporting the rifle company in the face 
              of devastating rifle, machinegun, and mortar fire. While many of 
              the friendly troops about him became casualties, he continued to 
              fire his machinegun until he was severely wounded and his gun rendered 
              useless by the burst of a mortar shell. Refusing to withdraw from 
              the violent action, he blasted fanatical Japanese troops with hand 
              grenades until wounded again, this time mortally. By his intrepidity 
              and the extreme tenacity with which he held firm until death against 
              overwhelming forces, Pfc. May killed at least 16 Japanese, was largely 
              responsible for maintaining the American lines, and inspired his 
              comrades to efforts which later resulted in complete victory and 
              seizure of the mountain stronghold.

              a torrent of enemy fire that converged on them from a circular ridge 
              commanding their position, Cpl. Mayfield, in a gallant single-handed

              gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call 
              of duty. On 22 January 1944, Company F had the mission of crossing 
              the Rapido River in the vicinity of San Angelo, Italy, and attacking 
              the well-prepared German positions to the west. For the defense 
              of these positions the enemy had prepared a network of machinegun 
              positions covering the terrain to the front with a pattern of withering 
              machinegun fire, and mortar and artillery positions zeroed in on 
              the defilade areas. S/Sgt. McCall commanded a machinegun section 
              that was to provide added fire support for the riflemen. Under cover 
              of darkness, Company F advanced to the river crossing site and under 
              intense enemy mortar, artillery, and machinegun fire crossed an 
              ice-covered bridge which was continually the target for enemy fire. 
              Many casualties occurred on reaching the west side of the river 
              and reorganization was imperative. Exposing himself to the deadly 
              enemy machinegun and small arms fire that swept over the flat terrain, 
              S/Sgt. McCall, with unusual calmness, encouraged and welded his 
              men into an effective fighting unit. He then led them forward across 
              the muddy, exposed terrain. Skillfully he guided his men through 
              a barbed-wire entanglement to reach a road where he personally placed 
              the weapons of his two squads into positions of vantage, covering 
              the battalion's front. A shell landed near one of the positions, 
              wounding the gunner, killing the assistant gunner, and destroying 
              the weapon. Even though enemy shells were falling dangerously near, 
              S/Sgt. McCall crawled across the treacherous terrain and rendered 
              first aid to the wounded man, dragging him into a position of cover 
              with the help of another man. The gunners of the second machinegun 
              had been wounded from the fragments of an enemy shell, leaving S/Sgt. 
              McCall the only remaining member of his machinegun section. Displaying 
              outstanding aggressiveness, he ran forward with the weapon on his 
              hip, reaching a point 30 yards from the enemy, where he fired 2 
              bursts of fire into the nest, killing or wounding all of the crew 
              and putting the gun out of action. A second machinegun now opened 
              fire upon him and he rushed its position, firing his weapon from 
              the hip, killing 4 of the guncrew. A third machinegun, 50 yards 
              in rear of the first two, was delivering a tremendous volume of 
              fire upon our troops. S/Sgt. McCall spotted its position and valiantly 
              went toward it in the face of overwhelming enemy fire. He was last 
              seen courageously moving forward on the enemy position, firing his 
              machinegun from his hip. S/Sgt. McCall's intrepidity and unhesitating 
              willingness to sacrifice his life exemplify the highest traditions 
              of the Armed Forces.

              planes against a force of 80 Japanese carrier-based aircraft bearing

              on 16 February 1945, he crossed 30 yards of open ground under intense 
              enemy fire, and at pointblank range silenced a machinegun with hand

              evening, when a large force attempted to bypass his company, he 
              voluntarily moved to an exposed area and opened fire. The enemy 
              attacked his position repeatedly throughout the night and was each 
              time repulsed. By 2 o'clock in the morning, all the men about him 
              had been wounded; but shouting encouragement to his comrades and 
              defiance at the enemy, he continued to bear the brunt of the attack, 
              fearlessly exposing himself to locate enemy soldiers and then pouring 
              heavy fire on them. He repeatedly crawled back to the American line 
              to secure more ammunition. When his submachine gun would no longer 
              operate, he seized an automatic rifle and continued to inflict heavy 
              casualties. This weapon, in turn, became too hot to use and, discarding

              pillbox, he boldly stood upright in full view of the enemy and dispatched 
              both troops before advancing to a second emplacement under greatly 
              intensified fire and then blasted the strong fortifications with 
              a well-planned demolitions attack. Subsequently entering the ruins, 
              he found a Japanese taking aim at 1 of our men and, with alert presence 
              of mind, jumped the enemy, disarmed and shot him with his own weapon. 
              Then, intent on smashing through the narrow breach, he rallied the 
              remainder of his company and pressed a full attack with furious 
              aggressiveness until he had neutralized all resistance and captured 
              the ridge. An inspiring leader and indomitable fighter, Capt. McCarthy 
              consistently disregarded all personal danger during the fierce conflict 
              and, by his brilliant professional skill, daring tactics, and tenacious

              air raids against Allied ships on radar picket duty off Okinawa 
              on 10 June, Lt. McCool aided materially in evacuating all survivors 
              from a sinking destroyer which had sustained mortal damage under 
              the devastating attacks. When his own craft was attacked simultaneously 
              by 2 of the enemy's suicide squadron early in the evening of 11 
              June, he instantly hurled the full power of his gun batteries against 
              the plunging aircraft, shooting down the first and damaging the

              He displayed conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity. His platoon 
              and 1 other from Company G were pinned down in a roadside ditch 
              by heavy fire from 5 Japanese tanks supported by 10 machineguns 
              and a platoon of riflemen. When 1 of his men fell wounded 40 yards 
              away, he unhesitatingly crossed the road under a hail of bullets 
              and moved the man 75 yards to safety. Although he had suffered a 
              deep arm wound, he returned to his post. Finding the platoon leader 
              seriously wounded, he assumed command and rallied his men. Once

              He was painfully wounded in an artillery barrage that preceded the 
              powerful counteroffensive launched by the Germans near Krinkelt, 
              Belgium, on the morning of 16 December 1944. He made his way to 
              an aid station, received treatment, and then refused to be evacuated, 
              choosing to return to his hard-pressed men instead. The fury of 
              the enemy's great Western Front offensive swirled about the position 
              held by T/Sgt. McGarity's small force, but so tenaciously did these 
              men fight on orders to stand firm at all costs that they could not 
              be dislodged despite murderous enemy fire and the breakdown of their 
              communications. During the day the heroic squad leader rescued 1 
              of his friends who had been wounded in a forward position, and throughout 
              the night he exhorted his comrades to repulse the enemy's attempts 
              at infiltration. When morning came and the Germans attacked with 
              tanks and infantry, he braved heavy fire to run to an advantageous 
              position where he immobilized the enemy's lead tank with a round 
              from a rocket launcher. Fire from his squad drove the attacking 
              infantrymen back, and 3 supporting tanks withdrew. He rescued, under 
              heavy fire, another wounded American, and then directed devastating 
              fire on a light cannon which had been brought up by the hostile 
              troops to clear resistance from the area. When ammunition began 
              to run low, T/Sgt. McGarity, remembering an old ammunition hole 
              about 100 yards distant in the general direction of the enemy, braved 
              a concentration of hostile fire to replenish his unit's supply. 
              By circuitous route the enemy managed to emplace a machinegun to 
              the rear and flank of the squad's position, cutting off the only 
              escape route. Unhesitatingly, the gallant soldier took it upon himself 
              to destroy this menace single-handedly. He left cover, and while 
              under steady fire from the enemy, killed or wounded all the hostile 
              gunners with deadly accurate rifle fire and prevented all attempts 
              to reman the gun. Only when the squad's last round had been fired 
              was the enemy able to advance and capture the intrepid leader and 
              his men. The extraordinary bravery and extreme devotion to duty 
              of T/Sgt. McGarity supported a remarkable delaying action which 
              provided the time necessary for assembling reserves and forming 
              a line against which the German striking power was shattered.

              in the sector where the assault boats landed, but had left the shore 
              heavily strewn with antipersonnel mines. Two men of the first wave 
              attempting to work their way forward detonated mines which wounded

              which had been established near Dingalan Bay. Just before daybreak 
              approximately 100 Japanese stealthily attacked the perimeter defense, 
              concentrating on a light machinegun position manned by 3 Americans. 
              Having completed a long tour of duty at this gun, Pvt. McKinney 
              was resting a few paces away when an enemy soldier dealt him a glancing 
              blow on the head with a saber. Although dazed by the stroke, he 
              seized his rifle, bludgeoned his attacker, and then shot another 
              assailant who was charging him. Meanwhile, 1 of his comrades at 
              the machinegun had been wounded and his other companion withdrew 
              carrying the injured man to safety. Alone, Pvt. McKinney was confronted 
              by 10 infantrymen who had captured the machinegun with the evident 
              intent of reversing it to fire into the perimeter. Leaping into 
              the emplacement, he shot 7 of them at pointblank range and killed 
              3 more with his rifle butt. In the melee the machinegun was rendered 
              inoperative, leaving him only his rifle with which to meet the advancing 
              Japanese, who hurled grenades and directed knee mortar shells into 
              the perimeter. He warily changed position, secured more ammunition, 
              and reloading repeatedly, cut down waves of the fanatical enemy 
              with devastating fire or clubbed them to death in hand-to-hand combat. 
              When assistance arrived, he had thwarted the assault and was in 
              complete control of the area. Thirty-eight dead Japanese around 
              the machinegun and 2 more at the side of a mortar 45 yards distant 
              was the amazing toll he had exacted single-handedly. By his indomitable

              condition and unwilling to further endanger the lives of his comrades, 
              he stoically crawled a distance of 200 yards to a sheltered position 
              within friendly lines before calling for aid. By his fearless initiative 
              and bold tactics, Pvt. McTureous had succeeded in neutralizing the 
              enemy fire, killing 6 Japanese troops and effectively disorganizing 
              the remainder of the savagely defending garrison. His outstanding 
              valor and heroic spirit of self-sacrifice during a critical stage 
              of operations reflect the highest credit upon himself and the U.S. 
              Naval Service.

              enemy counterattack of platoon strength was launched against 1 platoon 
              of Company G, 23d Infantry. Since the Company G platoon was not 
              dug in and had just begun to assume defensive positions along a 
              hedge, part of the line sagged momentarily under heavy fire from 
              small arms and 2 flak guns, leaving a section of heavy machineguns 
              holding a wide frontage without rifle protection. The enemy drive 
              moved so swiftly that German riflemen were soon almost on top of 
              1 machinegun position. Sgt. McVeigh, heedless of a tremendous amount 
              of small arms and flak fire directed toward him, stood up in full 
              view of the enemy and directed the fire of his squad on the attacking 
              Germans until his position was almost overrun. He then drew his 
              trench knife. and single-handed charged several of the enemy. In 
              a savage hand-to-hand struggle, Sgt. McVeigh killed 1 German with 
              the knife, his only weapon, and was advancing on 3 more of the enemy 
              when he was shot down and killed with small arms fire at pointblank 
              range. Sgt. McVeigh's heroic act allowed the 2 remaining men in 
              his squad to concentrate their machinegun fire on the attacking 
              enemy and then turn their weapons on the 3 Germans in the road, 
              killing all 3. Fire from this machinegun and the other gun of the 
              section was almost entirely responsible for stopping this enemy 
              assault, and allowed the rifle platoon to which it was attached 
              time to reorganize, assume positions on and hold the high ground 
              gained during the day.

              German force Its position was overrun and he was surrounded when 
              our troops were driven back by overwhelming numbers and firepower. 
              Disregarding the fury of the enemy fire concentrated on him he maintained

              His unit, attempting a quick conquest of hostile hill positions 
              that would open the route to Nuremberg before the enemy could organize 
              his defense of that city, was pinned down by brutal fire from rifles, 
              machine pistols, and 2 heavy machineguns. Entirely on his own initiative, 
              Pvt. Merrell began a single-handed assault. He ran 100 yards through 
              concentrated fire, barely escaping death at each stride, and at 
              pointblank range engaged 4 German machine pistolmen with his rifle, 
              killing all of them while their bullets ripped his uniform. As he 
              started forward again, his rifle was smashed by a sniper's bullet, 
              leaving him armed only with 3 grenades. But he did not hesitate. 
              He zigzagged 200 yards through a hail of bullets to within 10 yards 
              of the first machinegun, where he hurled 2 grenades and then rushed 
              the position ready to fight with his bare hands if necessary. In 
              the emplacement he seized a Luger pistol and killed what Germans 
              had survived the grenade blast. Rearmed, he crawled toward the second 
              machinegun located 30 yards away, killing 4 Germans in camouflaged 
              foxholes on the way, but himself receiving a critical wound in the 
              abdomen. And yet he went on, staggering, bleeding, disregarding 
              bullets which tore through the folds of his clothing and glanced 
              off his helmet. He threw his last grenade into the machinegun nest 
              and stumbled on to wipe out the crew. He had completed this self-appointed 
              task when a machine pistol burst killed him instantly. In his spectacular 
              1-man attack Pvt. Merrell killed 6 Germans in the first machinegun 
              emplacement, 7 in the next, and an additional 10 infantrymen who 
              were astride his path to the weapons which would have decimated 
              his unit had he not assumed the burden of the assault and stormed 
              the enemy positions with utter fearlessness, intrepidity of the 
              highest order, and a willingness to sacrifice his own life so that 
              his comrades could go on to victory.

              man to man along his 40-yard squad front, encouraging each to hold 
              against the overwhelming assault of a fanatical foe surging up the 
              hillside. Knocked to the ground by a burst from an enemy automatic 
              weapon, he immediately jumped to his feet, and ignoring his grave

              On a bombing run upon the marshaling yards at Saarbrucken, Germany, 
              on 9 November 1944, a B17 aircraft on which 2d Lt. Metzger was serving 
              as copilot was seriously damaged by antiaircraft fire. Three of 
              the aircraft's engines were damaged beyond control and on fire; 
              dangerous flames from the No. 4 engine were leaping back as far 
              as the tail assembly. Flares in the cockpit were ignited and a fire 
              roared therein which was further increased by free-flowing fluid 
              from damaged hydraulic lines. The interphone system was rendered 
              useless. In addition to these serious mechanical difficulties the 
              engineer was wounded in the leg and the radio operator's arm was 
              severed below the elbow. Suffering from intense pain, despite the 
              application of a tourniquet, the radio operator fell unconscious. 
              Faced with the imminent explosion of his aircraft and death to his 
              entire crew, mere seconds before bombs away on the target, 2d Lt. 
              Metzger and his pilot conferred. Something had to be done immediately 
              to save the life of the wounded radio operator. The lack of a static 
              line and the thought that his unconscious body striking the ground 
              in unknown territory would not bring immediate medical attention 
              forced a quick decision. 2d Lt. Metzger and his pilot decided to 
              fly the flaming aircraft to friendly territory and then attempt 
              to crash land. Bombs were released on the target and the crippled 
              aircraft proceeded along to Allied-controlled territory. When that 
              had been reached 2d Lt. Metzger personally informed all crewmembers 
              to bail out upon the suggestion of the pilot. 2d Lt. Metzger chose 
              to remain with the pilot for the crash landing in order to assist 
              him in this emergency. With only 1 normally functioning engine and 
              with the danger of explosion much greater, the aircraft banked into 
              an open field, and when it was at an altitude of 100 feet it exploded, 
              crashed, exploded again, and then disintegrated. All 3 crewmembers 
              were instantly killed. 2d Lt. Metzger's loyalty to his crew, his 
              determination to accomplish the task set forth to him, and his deed 
              of knowingly performing what may have been his last service to his 
              country was an example of valor at its highest.

              gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while 
              serving as pilot of a B17 aircraft on a heavy-bombardment mission 
              to Germany, 11 April 1944. The group in which 1st Lt. Michael was 
              flying was attacked by a swarm of fighters. His plane was singled 
              out and the fighters pressed their attacks home recklessly, completely 
              disregarding the Allied fighter escort and their own intense flak. 
              His plane was riddled from nose to tail with exploding cannon shells 
              and knocked out of formation, with a large number of fighters following 
              it down, blasting it with cannon fire as it descended. A cannon 
              shell exploded in the cockpit, wounded the copilot, wrecked the 
              instruments, and blew out the side window. 1st Lt. Michael was seriously 
              and painfully wounded in the right thigh. Hydraulic fluid filmed 
              over the windshield making visibility impossible, and smoke filled 
              the cockpit. The controls failed to respond and 3,000 feet were 
              lost before he succeeded in leveling off. The radio operator informed 
              him that the whole bomb bay was in flames as a result of the explosion 
              of 3 cannon shells, which had ignited the incendiaries. With a full 
              load of incendiaries in the bomb bay and a considerable gas load 
              in the tanks, the danger of fire enveloping the plane and the tanks 
              exploding seemed imminent. When the emergency release lever failed 
              to function, 1st Lt. Michael at once gave the order to bail out 
              and 7 of the crew left the plane. Seeing the bombardier firing the 
              navigator's gun at the enemy planes, 1st Lt. Michael ordered him 
              to bail out as the plane was liable to explode any minute. When 
              the bombardier looked for his parachute he found that it had been 
              riddled with 20mm. fragments and was useless. 1st Lt. Michael, seeing 
              the ruined parachute, realized that if the plane was abandoned the 
              bombardier would perish and decided that the only chance would be 
              a crash landing. Completely disregarding his own painful and profusely 
              bleeding wounds, but thinking only of the safety of the remaining 
              crewmembers, he gallantly evaded the enemy, using violent evasive 
              action despite the battered condition of his plane. After the plane 
              had been under sustained enemy attack for fully 45 minutes, 1st 
              Lt. Michael finally lost the persistent fighters in a cloud bank. 
              Upon emerging, an accurate barrage of flak caused him to come down 
              to treetop level where flak towers poured a continuous rain of fire 
              on the plane. He continued into France, realizing that at any moment 
              a crash landing might have to be attempted, but trying to get as 
              far as possible to increase the escape possibilities if a safe landing 
              could be achieved. 1st Lt. Michael flew the plane until he became 
              exhausted from the loss of blood, which had formed on the floor 
              in pools, and he lost consciousness. The copilot succeeded in reaching 
              England and sighted an RAF field near the coast. 1st Lt. Michael 
              finally regained consciousness and insisted upon taking over the 
              controls to land the plane. The undercarriage was useless; the bomb 
              bay doors were jammed open; the hydraulic system and altimeter were 
              shot out. In addition, there was no airspeed indicator, the ball 
              turret was jammed with the guns pointing downward, and the flaps 
              would not respond. Despite these apparently insurmountable obstacles, 
              he landed the plane without mishap.

              wooded ridge northeast of the village of Neiderzerf, Germany, early 
              on 13 March 1945. A short distance up the side of the hill, 2d Lt. 
              Michael, at the head of his platoon, heard the click of an enemy 
              machinegun bolt. Quietly halting the company, he silently moved 
              off into the woods and discovered 2 enemy machineguns and crews. 
              Executing a sudden charge, he completely surprised the enemy and 
              captured the guns and crews. At daybreak, enemy voices were heard 
              in the thick woods ahead. Leading his platoon in a flanking movement, 
              they charged the enemy with hand grenades and, after a bitter fight, 
              captured 25 members of an SS mountain division, 3 artillery pieces, 
              and 20 horses. While his company was establishing its position, 
              2d Lt. Michael made 2 personal reconnaissance missions of the wood 
              on his left flank. On his first mission he killed 2, wounded 4, 
              and captured 6 enemy soldiers single-handedly. On the second mission 
              he captured 7 prisoners. During the afternoon he led his platoon 
              on a frontal assault of a line of enemy pillboxes, successfully 
              capturing the objective, killing 10 and capturing 30 prisoners. 
              The following morning the company was subjected to sniper fire and 
              2d Lt. Michael, in an attempt to find the hidden sniper, was shot 
              and killed. The inspiring leadership and heroic aggressiveness displayed 
              by 2d Lt. Michael upheld the highest traditions of the military 
              service.

              No.: 74, 1 September 1945. Citation: For performing a series of 
              heroic deeds from 1629 November 1944, during his company's relentless 
              drive from Woippy, France, through Metz to Kerprich Hemmersdorf, 
              Germany. As he led a rifle squad on 16 November at Woippy, a crossfire 
              from enemy machineguns pinned down his unit. Ordering his men to 
              remain under cover, he went forward alone, entered a building housing 
              1 of the guns and forced S Germans to surrender at bayonet point. 
              He then took the second gun single-handedly by hurling grenades 
              into the enemy position, killing 2, wounding 3 more, and taking 
              2 additional prisoners. At the outskirts of Metz the next day, when 
              his platoon, confused by heavy explosions and the withdrawal of 
              friendly tanks, retired, he fearlessly remained behind armed with 
              an automatic rifle and exchanged bursts with a German machinegun 
              until he silenced the enemy weapon. His quick action in covering 
              his comrades gave the platoon time to regroup and carry on the fight. 
              On 19 November S/Sgt. Miller led an attack on large enemy barracks. 
              Covered by his squad, he crawled to a barracks window, climbed in 
              and captured 6 riflemen occupying the room. His men, and then the 
              entire company, followed through the window, scoured the building, 
              and took 75 prisoners. S/Sgt. Miller volunteered, with 3 comrades, 
              to capture Gestapo officers who were preventing the surrender of 
              German troops in another building. He ran a gauntlet of machinegun 
              fire and was lifted through a window. Inside, he found himself covered 
              by a machine pistol, but he persuaded the 4 Gestapo agents confronting 
              him to surrender. Early the next morning, when strong hostile forces 
              punished his company with heavy fire, S/Sgt. Miller assumed the 
              task of destroying a well-placed machinegun. He was knocked down 
              by a rifle grenade as he climbed an open stairway in a house, but 
              pressed on with a bazooka to find an advantageous spot from which 
              to launch his rocket. He discovered that he could fire only from 
              the roof, a position where he would draw tremendous enemy fire. 
              Facing the risk, he moved into the open, coolly took aim and scored 
              a direct hit on the hostile emplacement, wreaking such havoc that 
              the enemy troops became completely demoralized and began surrendering 
              by the score. The following day, in Metz, he captured 12 more prisoners 
              and silenced an enemy machinegun after volunteering for a hazardous 
              mission in advance of his company's position. On 29 November, as 
              Company G climbed a hill overlooking Kerprich Hemmersdorf, enemy 
              fire pinned the unit to the ground. S/Sgt. Miller, on his own initiative, 
              pressed ahead with his squad past the company's leading element 
              to meet the surprise resistance. His men stood up and advanced deliberately, 
              firing as they went. Inspired by S/Sgt. Miller's leadership, the 
              platoon followed, and then another platoon arose and grimly closed 
              with the Germans. The enemy action was smothered, but at the cost 
              of S/Sgt. Miller's life. His tenacious devotion to the attack, his 
              gallant choice to expose himself to enemy action rather than endanger 
              his men, his limitless bravery, assured the success of Company G.

              gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call 
              of duty. Pvt. Mills, undergoing his baptism of fire, preceded his 
              platoon down a draw to reach a position from which an attack could 
              be launched against a heavily fortified strongpoint. After advancing 
              about 300 yards, Pvt. Mills was fired on by a machinegun only S 
              yards distant. He killed the gunner with 1 shot and forced the surrender 
              of the assistant gunner. Continuing his advance, he saw a German 
              soldier in a camouflaged position behind a large bush pulling the 
              pin of a potato-masher grenade. Covering the German with his rifle, 
              Pvt. Mills forced him to drop the grenade and captured him. When 
              another enemy soldier attempted to throw a hand grenade into the 
              draw, Pvt. Mills killed him with 1 shot. Brought under fire by a 
              machinegun, 2 machine pistols, and 3 rifles at a range of only 50 
              feet, he charged headlong into the furious chain of automatic fire 
              shooting his M 1 from the hip. The enemy was completely demoralized 
              by Pvt. Mills' daring charge, and when he reached a point within 
              10 feet of their position, all 6 surrendered. As he neared the end 
              of the draw, Pvt. Mills was brought under fire by a machinegunner 
              20 yards distant. Despite the fact that he had absolutely no cover, 
              Pvt. Mills killed the gunner with 1 shot. Two enemy soldiers near 
              the machinegunner fired wildly at Pvt. Mills and then fled. Pvt. 
              Mills fired twice, killing 1 of the enemy. Continuing on to the 
              position, he captured a fourth soldier. When it became apparent 
              that an assault on the strongpoint would in all probability cause 
              heavy casualties on the platoon, Pvt. Mills volunteered to cover 
              the advance down a shallow ditch to a point within 50 yards of the 
              objective. Standing on the bank in full view of the enemy less than 
              100 yards away, he shouted and fired his rifle directly into the 
              position. His ruse worked exactly as planned. The enemy centered 
              his fire on Pvt. Mills. Tracers passed within inches of his body, 
              rifle and machine pistol bullets ricocheted off the rocks at his 
              feet. Yet he stood there firing until his rifle was empty. Intent 
              on covering the movement of his platoon, Pvt. Mills jumped into 
              the draw, reloaded his weapon, climbed out again, and continued 
              to lay down a base of fire. Repeating this action 4 times, he enabled 
              his platoon to reach the designated spot undiscovered, from which 
              position it assaulted and overwhelmed the enemy, capturing 22 Germans 
              and taking the objective without casualties.

              in action involving actual conflict with the enemy on 21 November 
              1944, near Hurtgen, Germany. S/Sgt. Minick's battalion was halted 
              in its advance by extensive minefields, exposing troops to heavy 
              concentrations of enemy artillery and mortar fire. Further delay 
              in the advance would result in numerous casualties and a movement 
              through the minefield was essential. Voluntarily, S/Sgt. Minick 
              led 4 men through hazardous barbed wire and debris, finally making 
              his way through the minefield for a distance of 300 yards. When 
              an enemy machinegun opened fire, he signaled his men to take covered 
              positions, edged his way alone toward the flank of the weapon and 
              opened fire, killing 2 members of the guncrew and capturing 3 others. 
              Moving forward again, he encountered and engaged single-handedly 
              an entire company killing 20 Germans and capturing 20, and enabling 
              his platoon to capture the remainder of the hostile group. Again 
              moving ahead and spearheading his battalion's advance, he again 
              encountered machinegun fire. Crawling forward toward the weapon, 
              he reached a point from which he knocked the weapon out of action. 
              Still another minefield had to be crossed. Undeterred, S/Sgt. Minick 
              advanced forward alone through constant enemy fire and while thus 
              moving, detonated a mine and was instantly killed.

              assaulted the enemy under a withering machinegun and rifle fire,

              with the initial assault waves on the coast of France under heavy 
              enemy fire. Without regard to his own personal safety he continually 
              moved up and down the beach reorganizing men for further assault. 
              He then led the assault over a narrow protective ledge and across 
              the flat, exposed terrain to the comparative safety of a cliff. 
              Retracing his steps across the field to the beach, he moved over 
              to where 2 tanks were buttoned up and blind under violent enemy 
              artillery and machinegun fire. Completely exposed to the intense 
              fire, 1st Lt. Monteith led the tanks on foot through a minefield 
              and into firing positions. Under his direction several enemy positions 
              were destroyed. He then rejoined his company and under his leadership 
              his men captured an advantageous position on the hill. Supervising 
              the defense of his newly won position against repeated vicious counterattacks, 
              he continued to ignore his own personal safety, repeatedly crossing 
              the 200 or 300 yards of open terrain under heavy fire to strengthen 
              links in his defensive chain. When the enemy succeeded in completely

              fight out of the situation, 1st Lt. Monteith was killed by enemy

              at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty on 22 February 
              1944, near Padiglione, Italy. Two hours before daybreak a strong 
              force of enemy infantry established themselves in 3 echelons at 
              50 yards, 100 yards, and 300 yards, respectively, in front of the 
              rifle platoons commanded by 1st Lt. Montgomery. The closest position, 
              consisting of 4 machineguns and 1 mortar, threatened the immediate 
              security of the platoon position. Seizing an Ml rifle and several 
              hand grenades, 1st Lt. Montgomery crawled up a ditch to within hand 
              grenade range of the enemy. Then climbing boldly onto a little mound, 
              he fired his rifle and threw his grenades so accurately that he 
              killed 8 of the enemy and captured the remaining 4. Returning to 
              his platoon, he called for artillery fire on a house, in and around 
              which he suspected that the majority of the enemy had entrenched 
              themselves. Arming himself with a carbine, he proceeded along the 
              shallow ditch, as withering fire from the riflemen and machinegunners 
              in the second position was concentrated on him. He attacked this 
              position with such fury that 7 of the enemy surrendered to him, 
              and both machineguns were silenced. Three German dead were found 
              in the vicinity later that morning. 1st Lt. Montgomery continued 
              boldly toward the house, 300 yards from his platoon position. It 
              was now daylight, and the enemy observation was excellent across 
              the flat open terrain which led to 1st Lt. Montgomery's objective. 
              When the artillery barrage had lifted, 1st Lt. Montgomery ran fearlessly 
              toward the strongly defended position. As the enemy started streaming 
              out of the house, 1st Lt. Montgomery, unafraid of treacherous snipers, 
              exposed himself daringly to assemble the surrendering enemy and 
              send them to the rear. His fearless, aggressive, and intrepid actions 
              that morning, accounted for a total of 11 enemy dead, 32 prisoners, 
              and an unknown number of wounded. That night, while aiding an adjacent 
              unit to repulse a counterattack, he was struck by mortar fragments 
              and seriously wounded. The selflessness and courage exhibited by 
              1st Lt. Montgomery in alone attacking 3 strong enemy positions inspired 
              his men to a degree beyond estimation.

              He fought with conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity when powerful 
              Japanese counterblows were being struck in a desperate effort to 
              annihilate a newly won beachhead. In a forward position, armed with 
              a submachinegun, he met the brunt of a strong, well-supported night 
              attack which quickly enveloped his platoon's flanks. Many men in 
              nearby positions were killed or injured, and Pvt. Moon was wounded 
              as his foxhole became the immediate object of a concentration of 
              mortar and machinegun fire. Nevertheless, he maintained his stand, 
              poured deadly fire into the enemy, daringly exposed himself to hostile 
              fire time after time to exhort and inspire what American troops 
              were left in the immediate area. A Japanese officer, covered by 
              machinegun fire and hidden by an embankment, attempted to knock 
              out his position with grenades, but Pvt. Moon, after protracted 
              and skillful maneuvering, killed him. When the enemy advanced a 
              light machinegun to within 20 yards of the shattered perimeter and 
              fired with telling effects on the remnants of the platoon, he stood 
              up to locate the gun and remained exposed while calling back range 
              corrections to friendly mortars which knocked out the weapon. A 
              little later he killed 2 Japanese as they charged an aid man. By 
              dawn his position, the focal point of the attack for more than 4 
              hours, was virtually surrounded. In a fanatical effort to reduce 
              it and kill its defender, an entire platoon charged with fixed bayonets. 
              Firing from a sitting position, Pvt. Moon calmly emptied his magazine 
              into the advancing horde, killing 18 and repulsing the attack. In 
              a final display of bravery, he stood up to throw a grenade at a

              and instantly killed, falling in the position from which he had 
              not been driven by the fiercest enemy action. Nearly 200 dead Japanese 
              were found within 100 yards of his foxhole. The continued tenacity, 
              combat sagacity, and magnificent heroism with which Pvt. Moon fought

              up a powerful enemy threat and did much to insure our initial successes

              of duty, while participating on a bombing mission over enemy-occupied 
              continental Europe, 28 July 1943. Prior to reaching the German coast 
              on the way to the target, the B17 airplane in which 2d Lt. Morgan 
              was serving as copilot was attacked by a large force of enemy fighters, 
              during which the oxygen system to the tail, waist, and radio gun 
              positions was knocked out. A frontal attack placed a cannon shell 
              through the windshield, totally shattering it, and the pilot's skull 
              was split open by a .303 caliber shell, leaving him in a crazed 
              condition. The pilot fell over the steering wheel, tightly clamping 
              his arms around it. 2d Lt. Morgan at once grasped the controls from 
              his side and, by sheer strength, pulled the airplane back into formation 
              despite the frantic struggles of the semiconscious pilot. The interphone 
              had been destroyed, rendering it impossible to call for help. At 
              this time the top turret gunner fell to the floor and down through 
              the hatch with his arm shot off at the shoulder and a gaping wound 
              in his side. The waist, tail, and radio gunners had lost consciousness 
              from lack of oxygen and, hearing no fire from their guns, the copilot 
              believed they had bailed out. The wounded pilot still offered desperate 
              resistance in his crazed attempts to fly the airplane. There remained 
              the prospect of flying to and over the target and back to a friendly 
              base wholly unassisted. In the face of this desperate situation, 
              2d Lt. Officer Morgan made his decision to continue the flight and 
              protect any members of the crew who might still be in the ship and 
              for 2 hours he flew in formation with one hand at the controls and 
              the other holding off the struggling pilot before the navigator 
              entered the steering compartment and relieved the situation. The 
              miraculous and heroic performance of 2d Lt. Morgan on this occasion 
              resulted in the successful completion of a vital bombing mission 
              and the safe return of his airplane and crew.

              a gorge where it was discovered that one of the group had been left

              to protect other wounded while the bulk of the troops quickly took 
              up more favorable positions. He had saved another casualty and killed 
              4 enemy infiltrators when he was struck and mortally wounded himself

              in action on 7 July 1944, near Castellina, Italy. While serving 
              as first scout, Private First Class Moto observed a machine gun 
              nest that was hindering his platoon's progress. On his own initiative, 
              he made his way to a point ten paces from the hostile position, 
              and killed the enemy machine gunner. Immediately, the enemy assistant 
              gunner opened fire in the direction of Private First Class Moto. 
              Crawling to the rear of the position, Private First Class Moto surprised 
              the enemy soldier, who quickly surrendered. Taking his prisoner 
              with him, Private First Class Moto took a position a few yards from 
              a house to prevent the enemy from using the building as an observation 
              post. While guarding the house and his prisoner, he observed an 
              enemy machine gun team moving into position. He engaged them, and 
              with deadly fire forced the enemy to withdraw. An enemy sniper located 
              in another house fired at Private First Class Moto, severely wounding 
              him. Applying first aid to his wound, he changed position to elude 
              the sniper fire and to advance. Finally relieved of his position, 
              he made his way to the rear for treatment. Crossing a road, he spotted 
              an enemy machine gun nest. Opening fire, he wounded two of the three

              soldier to surrender. Receiving no answer, Private First Class Moto 
              fired at the position, and the soldiers surrendered. Private First

              He was an assistant squad leader in an attack against strongly defended 
              enemy positions on both sides of a stream running through a wooded 
              gulch. As the squad advanced through concentrated fire, the leader 
              was killed and Sgt. Mower assumed command. In order to bring direct 
              fire upon the enemy, he had started to lead his men across the stream, 
              which by this time was churned by machinegun and rifle fire, but 
              he was severely wounded before reaching the opposite bank. After 
              signaling his unit to halt, he realized his own exposed position 
              was the most advantageous point from which to direct the attack, 
              and stood fast. Half submerged, gravely wounded, but refusing to 
              seek shelter or accept aid of any kind, he continued to shout and 
              signal to his squad as he directed it in the destruction of 2 enemy 
              machineguns and numerous riflemen. Discovering that the intrepid 
              man in the stream was largely responsible for the successful action 
              being taken against them, the remaining Japanese concentrated the 
              full force of their firepower upon him, and he was killed while 
              still urging his men on. Sgt. Mower's gallant initiative and heroic

              First Class Muranaga's company encountered a strong enemy force 
              in commanding positions and with superior firepower. An enemy 88mm 
              self-propelled gun opened direct fire on the company, causing the 
              men to disperse and seek cover. Private First Class Muranaga's mortar 
              squad was ordered to action, but the terrain made it impossible

              of the mortar position, moved his men away from the gun to positions

              command post and continued to give fire directions to the artillery

              abreast of his position, 2d Lt. Murphy climbed on the burning tank 
              destroyer, which was in danger of blowing up at any moment, and 
              employed its .50 caliber machinegun against the enemy. He was alone 
              and exposed to German fire from 3 sides, but his deadly fire killed 
              dozens of Germans and caused their infantry attack to waver. The

              in a counterattack which forced the Germans to withdraw. His directing 
              of artillery fire wiped out many of the enemy; he killed or wounded

              and crawling from man to man administering to them while in great 
              pain and bleeding profusely. He was killed by the blast of another 
              mine which he had dragged himself across in an effort to reach still 
              another casualty. With indomitable courage, and unquenchable spirit 
              of self-sacrifice and supreme devotion to duty which made it possible 
              for him to continue performing his tasks while barely able to move, 
              Pfc. Murphy saved many of his fellow soldiers at the cost of his 
              own life.

              Company C, 30th Infantry, displaying supreme courage and heroic 
              initiative near Kaysersberg, France, on 16 December 1944, while 
              leading a reinforced platoon into enemy territory. Descending into 
              a valley beneath hilltop positions held by our troops, he observed 
              a force of 200 Germans pouring deadly mortar, bazooka, machinegun, 
              and small arms fire into an American battalion occupying the crest 
              of the ridge. The enemy's position in a sunken road, though hidden 
              from the ridge, was open to a flank attack by 1st Lt. Murray's patrol 
              but he hesitated to commit so small a force to battle with the superior 
              and strongly disposed enemy. Crawling out ahead of his troops to 
              a vantage point, he called by radio for artillery fire. His shells 
              bracketed the German force, but when he was about to correct the 
              range his radio went dead. He returned to his patrol, secured grenades 
              and a rifle to launch them and went back to his self-appointed outpost. 
              His first shots disclosed his position; the enemy directed heavy 
              fire against him as he methodically fired his missiles into the 
              narrow defile. Again he returned to his patrol. With an automatic 
              rifle and ammunition, he once more moved to his exposed position. 
              Burst after burst he fired into the enemy, killing 20, wounding 
              many others, and completely disorganizing its ranks, which began 
              to withdraw. He prevented the removal of 3 German mortars by knocking 
              out a truck. By that time a mortar had been brought to his support. 
              1st Lt. Murray directed fire of this weapon, causing further casualties 
              and confusion in the German ranks. Calling on his patrol to follow, 
              he then moved out toward his original objective, possession of a 
              bridge and construction of a roadblock. He captured 10 Germans in 
              foxholes. An eleventh, while pretending to surrender, threw a grenade 
              which knocked him to the ground, inflicting 8 wounds. Though suffering 
              and bleeding profusely, he refused to return to the rear until he 
              had chosen the spot for the block and had seen his men correctly 
              deployed. By his single-handed attack on an overwhelming force and 
              by his intrepid and heroic fighting, 1st Lt. Murray stopped a counterattack, 
              established an advance position against formidable odds, and provided 
              an inspiring example for the men of his command.

              Private Nakamine's platoon became pinned down by intense machine 
              gun crossfire from a small knoll 200 yards to the front. On his

              to his front approximately 75 yards away, he returned to his platoon

              On the morning of 24 April 1943, Sgt. Nelson led his section of 
              heavy mortars to a forward position where he placed his guns and 
              men. Under intense enemy artillery, mortar, and small-arms fire, 
              he advanced alone to a chosen observation position from which he 
              directed the laying of a concentrated mortar barrage which successfully 
              halted an initial enemy counterattack. Although mortally wounded 
              in the accomplishment of his mission, and with his duty clearly 
              completed, Sgt. Nelson crawled to a still more advanced observation 
              point and continued to direct the fire of his section. Dying of 
              handgrenade wounds and only 50 yards from the enemy, Sgt. Nelson 
              encouraged his section to continue their fire and by doing so they 
              took a heavy toll of enemy lives. The skill which Sgt. Nelson displayed

              Attacking the strongly held German Anzio-Nettuno defense line near 
              Cisterna, Italy, 1st Lt. Newman, in the lead of his platoon, was 
              suddenly fired upon by 2 enemy machineguns located on the crest 
              of a hill about 100 yards to his front. The 4 scouts with him immediately 
              hit the ground, but 1st Lt. Newman remained standing in order to 
              see the enemy positions and his platoon then about 100 yards behind. 
              Locating the enemy nests, 1st Lt. Newman called back to his platoon 
              and ordered 1 squad to advance to him and the other to flank the 
              enemy to the right. Then, still standing upright in the face of 
              the enemy machinegun fire, 1st Lt. Newman opened up with his tommygun 
              on the enemy nests. From this range, his fire was not effective 
              in covering the advance of his squads, and 1 squad was pinned down 
              by the enemy fire. Seeing that his squad was unable to advance, 
              1st Lt. Newman, in full view of the enemy gunners and in the face 
              of their continuous fire, advanced alone on the enemy nests. He 
              returned their fire with his tommygun and succeeded in wounding 
              a German in each of the nests. The remaining 2 Germans fled from 
              the position into a nearby house. Three more enemy soldiers then 
              came out of the house and ran toward a third machinegun. 1st Lt. 
              Newman, still relentlessly advancing toward them, killed 1 before 
              he reached the gun, the second before he could fire it. The third 
              fled for his life back into the house. Covering his assault by firing 
              into the doors and windows of the house, 1st Lt. Newman, boldly 
              attacking by himself, called for the occupants to surrender to him. 
              Gaining the house, he kicked in the door and went inside. Although 
              armed with rifles and machine pistols, the 11 Germans there, apparently 
              intimidated, surrendered to the lieutenant without further resistance, 
              1st Lt. Newman, single-handed, had silenced 3 enemy machineguns, 
              wounded 2 Germans, killed 2 more, and took 11 prisoners. This demonstration 
              of sheer courage, bravery, and willingness to close with the enemy 
              even in the face of such heavy odds, instilled into these green 
              troops the confidence of veterans and reflects the highest traditions 
              of the U.S. Armed Forces.

              heroism in action on 7 November 1944, near La Houssiere, France. 
              After three days of unsuccessful attempts by his company to dislodge 
              the enemy from a strongly defended ridge, Private First Class Nishimoto, 
              as acting squad leader, boldly crawled forward through a heavily 
              mined and booby-trapped area. Spotting a machine gun nest, he hurled 
              a grenade and destroyed the emplacement. Then, circling to the rear 
              of another machine gun position, he fired his submachine gun at 
              point-blank range, killing one gunner and wounding another. Pursuing 
              two enemy riflemen, Private First Class Nishimoto killed one, while 
              the other hastily retreated. Continuing his determined assault, 
              he drove another machine gun crew from its position. The enemy, 
              with their key strong points taken, were forced to withdraw from 
              this sector. Private First Class Nishimoto's extraordinary heroism 
              and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions 
              of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and

              For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life 
              above and beyond the call of duty at Saipan, Marianas Islands, from 
              20 June through 7 July 1944. When assault elements of his platoon 
              were held up by intense enemy fire, Lt. Col. O'Brien ordered 3 tanks 
              to precede the assault companies in an attempt to knock out the 
              strongpoint. Due to direct enemy fire the tanks' turrets were closed, 
              causing the tanks to lose direction and to fire into our own troops. 
              Lt. Col. O'Brien, with complete disregard for his own safety, dashed 
              into full view of the enemy and ran to the leader's tank, and pounded 
              on the tank with his pistol butt to attract 2 of the tank's crew 
              and, mounting the tank fully exposed to enemy fire, Lt. Col. O'Brien 
              personally directed the assault until the enemy strongpoint had 
              been liquidated. On 28 June 1944, while his platoon was attempting 
              to take a bitterly defended high ridge in the vicinity of Donnay, 
              Lt. Col. O'Brien arranged to capture the ridge by a double envelopment 
              movement of 2 large combat battalions. He personally took control 
              of the maneuver. Lt. Col. O'Brien crossed 1,200 yards of sniper-infested 
              underbrush alone to arrive at a point where 1 of his platoons was 
              being held up by the enemy. Leaving some men to contain the enemy 
              he personally led 4 men into a narrow ravine behind, and killed 
              or drove off all the Japanese manning that strongpoint. In this 
              action he captured S machineguns and one 77-mm. fieldpiece. Lt. 
              Col. O'Brien then organized the 2 platoons for night defense and 
              against repeated counterattacks directed them. Meanwhile he managed 
              to hold ground. On 7 July 1944 his battalion and another battalion 
              were attacked by an overwhelming enemy force estimated at between 
              3,000 and 5,000 Japanese. With bloody hand-to-hand fighting in progress 
              everywhere, their forward positions were finally overrun by the 
              sheer weight of the enemy numbers. With many casualties and ammunition 
              running low, Lt. Col. O'Brien refused to leave the front lines. 
              Striding up and down the lines, he fired at the enemy with a pistol 
              in each hand and his presence there bolstered the spirits of the 
              men, encouraged them in their fight and sustained them in their 
              heroic stand. Even after he was seriously wounded, Lt. Col. O'Brien 
              refused to be evacuated and after his pistol ammunition was exhausted, 
              he manned a .50 caliber machinegun, mounted on a jeep, and continued 
              firing. When last seen alive he was standing upright firing into 
              the Jap hordes that were then enveloping him. Some time later his 
              body was found surrounded by enemy he had killed His valor was consistent 
              with the highest traditions of the service.

              Japan, on 19 March 1945. A valiant and forceful leader, calmly braving 
              the perilous barriers of flame and twisted metal to aid his men 
              and his ship, Lt. Comdr. O'Callahan groped his way through smoke-filled

              between his ship and an advancing enemy formation of 9 attacking 
              twin-engine heavy bombers. Without hesitation, alone and unaided,

              Ohata, his squad leader, and three men were ordered to protect his 
              platoon's left flank against an attacking enemy force of 40 men, 
              armed with machine guns, machine pistols, and rifles. He posted 
              one of his men, an automatic rifleman, on the extreme left, 15 yards 
              from his own position. Taking his position, Sergeant Ohata delivered 
              effective fire against the advancing enemy. The man to his left 
              called for assistance when his automatic rifle was shot and damaged. 
              With utter disregard for his personal safety, Sergeant Ohata left 
              his position and advanced 15 yards through heavy machine gun fire. 
              Reaching his comrade's position, he immediately fired upon the enemy, 
              killing 10 enemy soldiers and successfully covering his comrade's

              from all directions to launch smashing hits on 3 tankers, coolly 
              swung his ship to fire at a freighter and, in a split-second decision, 
              shot out of the path of an onrushing transport, missing it by inches. 
              Boxed in by blazing tankers, a freighter, transport, and several

              and, with pyrotechnics bursting on all sides, cleared the area. 
              Twenty-four hours later, he again made contact with a heavily escorted 
              convoy steaming to support the Leyte campaign with reinforcements 
              and supplies and with crated planes piled high on each unit. In 
              defiance of the enemy's relentless fire, he closed the concentration 
              of ship and in quick succession sent 2 torpedoes each into the first 
              and second transports and an adjacent tanker, finding his mark with 
              each torpedo in a series of violent explosions at less than l,000-yard 
              range. With ships bearing down from all sides, he charged the enemy 
              at high speed, exploding the tanker in a burst of flame, smashing 
              the transport dead in the water, and blasting the destroyer with 
              a mighty roar which rocked the Tang from stem to stern. Expending

              of duty. On 13 October 1943, when the drive across the Volturno 
              River began, Capt. Olson and his company spearheaded the advance 
              of the regiment through 30 miles of mountainous enemy territory 
              in 13 days. Placing himself at the head of his men, Capt. Olson 
              waded into the chest-deep water of the raging Volturno River and 
              despite pointblank machine-gun fire aimed directly at him made his 
              way to the opposite bank and threw 2 handgrenades into the gun position, 
              killing the crew. When an enemy machinegun 150 yards distant opened 
              fire on his company, Capt. Olson advanced upon the position in a 
              slow, deliberate walk. Although 5 German soldiers threw handgrenades 
              at him from a range of 5 yards, Capt. Olson dispatched them all, 
              picked up a machine pistol and continued toward the enemy. Advancing 
              to within 15 yards of the position he shot it out with the foe, 
              killing 9 and seizing the post. Throughout the next 13 days Capt. 
              Olson led combat patrols, acted as company No. 1 scout and maintained 
              unbroken contact with the enemy. On 27 October 1943, Capt. Olson 
              conducted a platoon in attack on a strongpoint, crawling to within 
              25 yards of the enemy and then charging the position. Despite continuous 
              machinegun fire which barely missed him, Capt. Olson made his way 
              to the gun and killed the crew with his pistol. When the men saw 
              their leader make this desperate attack they followed him and overran 
              the position. Continuing the advance, Capt. Olson led his company 
              to the next objective at the summit of Monte San Nicola. Although 
              the company to his right was forced to take cover from the furious 
              automatic and small arms fire, which was directed upon him and his 
              men with equal intensity, Capt. Olson waved his company into a skirmish 
              line and despite the fire of a machinegun which singled him out 
              as its sole target led the assault which drove the enemy away. While 
              making a reconnaissance for defensive positions, Capt. Olson was

              Olson, a light machine gunner, elected to sacrifice his life to 
              save his company from annihilation. On the night of 30 January 1944, 
              after a 16-hour assault on entrenched enemy positions in the course 
              of which over one-third of Company B became casualties, the survivors 
              dug in behind a horseshoe elevation, placing Sgt. Olson and his 
              crew, with the 1 available machinegun, forward of their lines and 
              in an exposed position to bear the brunt of the expected German 
              counterattack. Although he had been fighting without respite, Sgt. 
              Olson stuck grimly to his post all night while his guncrew was cut 
              down, 1 by 1, by accurate and overwhelming enemy fire. Weary from 
              over 24 hours of continuous battle and suffering from an arm wound, 
              received during the night engagement, Sgt. Olson manned his gun 
              alone, meeting the full force of an all-out enemy assault by approximately 
              200 men supported by mortar and machinegun fire which the Germans 
              launched at daybreak on the morning of 31 January. After 30 minutes 
              of fighting, Sgt. Olson was mortally wounded, yet, knowing that 
              only his weapons stood between his company and complete destruction, 
              he refused evacuation. For an hour and a half after receiving his 
              second and fatal wound he continued to fire his machinegun, killing 
              at least 20 of the enemy, wounding many more, and forcing the assaulting 
              German elements to withdraw.

              First Class Frank H. Ono distinguished himself by extraordinary 
              heroism in action on 4 July 1944, near Castellina, Italy. In attacking 
              a heavily defended hill, Private First Class Ono's squad was caught 
              in a hail of formidable fire from the well-entrenched enemy. Private 
              First Class Ono opened fire with his automatic rifle and silenced 
              one machine gun 300 hundred yards to the right front. Advancing 
              through incessant fire, he killed a sniper with another burst of 
              fire, and while his squad leader reorganized the rest of the platoon 
              in the rear, he alone defended the critical position. His weapon 
              was then wrenched from his grasp by a burst of enemy machine pistol 
              fire as enemy troops attempted to close in on him. Hurling hand 
              grenades, Private First Class Ono forced the enemy to abandon the 
              attempt, resolutely defending the newly won ground until the rest 
              of the platoon moved forward. Taking a wounded comrade's rifle, 
              Private First Class Ono again joined in the assault. After killing 
              two more enemy soldiers, he boldly ran through withering automatic, 
              small arms, and mortar fire to render first aid to his platoon leader 
              and a seriously wounded rifleman. In danger of being encircled, 
              the platoon was ordered to withdraw. Volunteering to cover the platoon, 
              Private First Class Ono occupied virtually unprotected positions 
              near the crest of the hill, engaging an enemy machine gun emplaced 
              on an adjoining ridge and exchanging fire with snipers armed with 
              machine pistols. Completely disregarding his own safety, he made 
              himself the constant target of concentrated enemy fire until the 
              platoon reached the comparative safety of a draw. He then descended 
              the hill in stages, firing his rifle, until he rejoined the platoon. 
              Private First Class Ono's extraordinary heroism and devotion to 
              duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service

              was a platoon leader with Company C, in an attack against strong 
              enemy positions. Deadly automatic fire from the flanks pinned down 
              his unit. Realizing that a machinegun in a nearby bunker must be 
              eliminated, he swiftly worked ahead alone, braving bullets which 
              struck about him, until close enough to throw a grenade into the 
              German position. He rushed the bunker and, with pointblank rifle 
              fire, killed all the hostile occupants who survived the grenade 
              blast. Another machinegun opened up on him, knocking him down and 
              seriously wounding him in the hip. Refusing to withdraw from the 
              battle, he placed himself at the head of his platoon to continue 
              the assault. As withering machinegun and rifle fire swept the area, 
              he struck out alone in advance of his men to a second bunker. With 
              a grenade, he crippled the dug-in machinegun defending this position 
              and then wiped out the troops manning it with his rifle, completing 
              his second self-imposed, 1-man attack. Although weak from loss of 
              blood, he refused to be evacuated until assured the mission was 
              successfully accomplished. Through quick thinking, indomitable courage, 
              and unswerving devotion to the attack in the face of bitter resistance 
              and while wounded, M /Sgt. Oresko killed 12 Germans, prevented a

              Sergeant Kazuo Otani distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism 
              in action on 15 July 1944, near Pieve Di S. Luce, Italy. Advancing 
              to attack a hill objective, Staff Sergeant Otani's platoon became 
              pinned down in a wheat field by concentrated fire from enemy machine 
              gun and sniper positions. Realizing the danger confronting his platoon, 
              Staff Sergeant Otani left his cover and shot and killed a sniper 
              who was firing with deadly effect upon the platoon. Followed by 
              a steady stream of machine gun bullets, Staff Sergeant Otani then 
              dashed across the open wheat field toward the foot of a cliff, and 
              directed his men to crawl to the cover of the cliff. When the movement 
              of the platoon drew heavy enemy fire, he dashed along the cliff 
              toward the left flank, exposing himself to enemy fire. By attracting 
              the attention of the enemy, he enabled the men closest to the cliff 
              to reach cover. Organizing these men to guard against possible enemy 
              counterattack, Staff Sergeant Otani again made his way across the 
              open field, shouting instructions to the stranded men while continuing 
              to draw enemy fire. Reaching the rear of the platoon position, he 
              took partial cover in a shallow ditch and directed covering fire 
              for the men who had begun to move forward. At this point, one of 
              his men became seriously wounded. Ordering his men to remain under 
              cover, Staff Sergeant Otani crawled to the wounded soldier who was 
              lying on open ground in full view of the enemy. Dragging the wounded

              first aid treatment, but was mortally wounded by machine gun fire.

              are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and

              in action against enemy Japanese forces during extremely hazardous 
              landing operations at Cape Torokina, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, 
              on 1 November 1943. Forced to pass within disastrous range of a 
              strongly protected, well-camouflaged Japanese 75-mm. regimental 
              gun strategically located on the beach, our landing units were suffering 
              heavy losses in casualties and boats while attempting to approach 
              the beach, and the success of the operations was seriously threatened. 
              Observing the ineffectiveness of marine rifle and grenade attacks 
              against the incessant, devastating fire of the enemy weapon and 
              aware of the urgent need for prompt action, Sgt. Owens unhesitatingly 
              determined to charge the gun bunker from the front and, calling 
              on 4 of his comrades to assist him, carefully placed them to cover 
              the fire of the 2 adjacent hostile bunkers. Choosing a moment that 
              provided a fair opportunity for passing these bunkers, he immediately 
              charged into the mouth of the steadily firing cannon and entered 
              the emplacement through the fire port, driving the guncrew out of 
              the rear door and insuring their destruction before he himself was 
              wounded. Indomitable and aggressive in the face of almost certain 
              death, Sgt. Owens silenced a powerful gun which was of inestimable 
              value to the Japanese defense and, by his brilliant initiative and 
              heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, contributed immeasurably to the 
              success of the vital landing operations. His valiant conduct throughout

              August 1942. When 1 engine of the bombardment airplane of which 
              he was pilot failed during a bombing mission over New Guinea, Capt. 
              Pease was forced to return to a base in Australia. Knowing that 
              all available airplanes of his group were to participate the next 
              day in an attack on an enemy-held airdrome near Rabaul, New Britain, 
              although he was not scheduled to take part in this mission, Capt. 
              Pease selected the most serviceable airplane at this base and prepared 
              it for combat, knowing that it had been found and declared unserviceable 
              for combat missions. With the members of his combat crew, who volunteered 
              to accompany him, he rejoined his squadron at Port Moresby, New 
              Guinea, at 1 a.m. on 7 August, after having flown almost continuously 
              since early the preceding morning. With only 3 hours' rest, he took 
              off with his squadron for the attack. Throughout the long flight 
              to Rabaul, New Britain, he managed by skillful flying of his unserviceable 
              airplane to maintain his position in the group. When the formation 
              was intercepted by about 30 enemy fighter airplanes before reaching 
              the target, Capt. Pease, on the wing which bore the brunt of the 
              hostile attack, by gallant action and the accurate shooting by his 
              crew, succeeded in destroying several Zeros before dropping his 
              bombs on the hostile base as planned, this in spite of continuous 
              enemy attacks. The fight with the enemy pursuit lasted 25 minutes 
              until the group dived into cloud cover. After leaving the target, 
              Capt. Pease's aircraft fell behind the balance of the group due 
              to unknown difficulties as a result of the combat, and was unable 
              to reach this cover before the enemy pursuit succeeded in igniting 
              1 of his bomb bay tanks. He was seen to drop the flaming tank. It 
              is believed that Capt. Pease's airplane and crew were subsequently 
              shot down in flames, as they did not return to their base. In voluntarily 
              performing this mission Capt. Pease contributed materially to the 
              success of the group, and displayed high devotion to duty, valor, 
              and complete contempt for personal danger. His undaunted bravery 
              has been a great inspiration to the officers and men of his unit.

              of about 45 infantrymen with whom he was advancing was ambushed 
              in the uncertain light of a waning moon. Enemy forces outnumbering 
              the Americans by 4 to 1 poured withering artillery, mortar, machinegun, 
              and small-arms fire into the stricken unit from the flanks, forcing 
              our men to seek the cover of a ditch which they found already occupied 
              by enemy foot troops. As the opposing infantrymen struggled in hand-to-hand 
              combat, Technician Peden courageously went to the assistance of 
              2 wounded soldiers and rendered first aid under heavy fire. With 
              radio communications inoperative, he realized that the unit would 
              be wiped out unless help could be secured from the rear. On his 
              own initiative, he ran 800 yards to the battalion command post through 
              a hail of bullets which pierced his jacket and there secured 2 light 
              tanks to go to the relief of his hard-pressed comrades. Knowing 
              the terrible risk involved, he climbed upon the hull of the lead 
              tank and guided it into battle. Through a murderous concentration 
              of fire the tank lumbered onward, bullets and shell fragments ricocheting 
              from its steel armor within inches of the completely exposed rider, 
              until it reached the ditch. As it was about to go into action it 
              was turned into a flaming pyre by a direct hit which killed Technician 
              Peden. However, his intrepidity and gallant sacrifice was not in 
              vain. Attracted by the light from the burning tank, reinforcements 
              found the beleaguered Americans and drove off the enemy.

              gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond 
              the call of duty on 12 October 1944. When Company I was advancing 
              on the town of Bardenberg, Germany, they reached a point approximately 
              two-thirds of the distance through the town when they were pinned 
              down by fire from a nest of enemy machineguns. This enemy strong 
              point was protected by a lone machinegun strategically placed at 
              an intersection and firing down a street which offered little or 
              no cover or concealment for the advancing troops. The elimination 
              of this protecting machinegun was imperative in order that the stronger 
              position it protected could be neutralized. After repeated and unsuccessful 
              attempts had been made to knock out this position, S/Sgt. Pendleton 
              volunteered to lead his squad in an attempt to neutralize this strongpoint. 
              S/Sgt. Pendleton started his squad slowly forward, crawling about 
              10 yards in front of his men in the advance toward the enemy gun. 
              After advancing approximately 130 yards under the withering fire, 
              S/Sgt. Pendleton was seriously wounded in the leg by a burst from 
              the gun he was assaulting. Disregarding his grievous wound, he ordered 
              his men to remain where they were, and with a supply of handgrenades 
              he slowly and painfully worked his way forward alone. With no hope 
              of surviving the veritable hail of machinegun fire which he deliberately 
              drew onto himself, he succeeded in advancing to within 10 yards 
              of the enemy position when he was instantly killed by a burst from 
              the enemy gun. By deliberately diverting the attention of the enemy 
              machine gunners upon himself, a second squad was able to advance, 
              undetected, and with the help of S/Sgt. Pendleton's squad, neutralized 
              the lone machinegun, while another platoon of his company advanced 
              up the intersecting street and knocked out the machinegun nest which 
              the first gun had been covering. S/Sgt. Pendleton's sacrifice enabled 
              the entire company to continue the advance and complete their mission 
              at a critical phase of the action.

              On 8 June 1944, the 3d Battalion of the 116th Infantry was advancing 
              on the strongly held German defenses at Grandcampe, France, when 
              the leading elements were suddenly halted by decimating machinegun 
              fire from a firmly entrenched enemy force on the high ground overlooking 
              the town. After numerous attempts to neutralize the enemy position 
              by supporting artillery and tank fire had proved ineffective, T/Sgt. 
              Peregory, on his own initiative, advanced up the hill under withering 
              fire, and worked his way to the crest where he discovered an entrenchment 
              leading to the main enemy fortifications 200 yards away. Without 
              hesitating, he leaped into the trench and moved toward the emplacement. 
              Encountering a squad of enemy riflemen, he fearlessly attacked them 
              with handgrenades and bayonet, killed 8 and forced 3 to surrender. 
              Continuing along the trench, he single-handedly forced the surrender 
              of 32 more riflemen, captured the machine gunners, and opened the 
              way for the leading elements of the battalion to advance and secure 
              its objective. The extraordinary gallantry and aggressiveness displayed 
              by T/Sgt. Peregory are exemplary of the highest tradition of the 
              armed forces.

              for Company A, which had destroyed 11 of 12 pillboxes in a strongly 
              fortified sector defending the approach to enemy-held Fort William 
              McKinley on Luzon, Philippine Islands. In the reduction of these 
              pillboxes, he killed 5 Japanese in the open and blasted others in 
              pillboxes with grenades. Realizing the urgent need for taking the 
              last emplacement, which contained 2 twin-mount .50-caliber dual-purpose 
              machineguns, he took a circuitous route to within 20 yards of the 
              position, killing 4 of the enemy in his advance. He threw a grenade 
              into the pillbox, and, as the crew started withdrawing through a 
              tunnel just to the rear of the emplacement, shot and killed 4 before 
              exhausting his clip. He had reloaded and killed 4 more when an escaping 
              Japanese threw his rifle with fixed bayonet at him. In warding off 
              this thrust, his own rifle was knocked to the ground. Seizing the 
              Jap rifle, he continued firing, killing 2 more of the enemy. He 
              rushed the remaining Japanese, killed 3 of them with the butt of 
              the rifle and entered the pillbox, where he bayoneted the 1 surviving 
              hostile soldier. Single-handedly, he killed 18 of the enemy in neutralizing 
              the position that had held up the advance of his entire company.

              Fluren, east of the Rhine. With 10 others, he landed in a field 
              about 75 yards from a German machinegun supported by riflemen, and 
              was immediately pinned down by heavy, direct fire. The position 
              of the small unit seemed hopeless with men struggling to free themselves 
              of their parachutes in a hail of bullets that cut them off from 
              their nearby equipment bundles, when Pvt. Peters stood up without 
              orders and began a l-man charge against the hostile emplacement 
              armed only with a rifle and grenades. His single-handed assault 
              immediately drew the enemy fire away from his comrades. He had run 
              halfway to his objective, pitting rifle fire against that of the 
              machinegun, when he was struck and knocked to the ground by a burst. 
              Heroically, he regained his feet and struggled onward. Once more 
              he was torn by bullets, and this time he was unable to rise. With 
              gallant devotion to his self-imposed mission, he crawled directly 
              into the fire that had mortally wounded him until close enough to 
              hurl grenades which knocked out the machinegun, killed 2 of its 
              operators, and drove protecting riflemen from their positions into 
              the safety of a woods. By his intrepidity and supreme sacrifice, 
              Pvt. Peters saved the lives of many of his fellow soldiers and made 
              it possible for them to reach their equipment, organize, and seize 
              their first objective.

              encountered an enemy battalion and came under heavy small-arms, 
              machinegun, and mortar fire, the 2d Platoon was given the mission 
              of flanking the enemy positions while the remaining units attacked 
              frontally. S/Sgt. Peterson crept and crawled to a position in the 
              lead and motioned for the 2d Platoon to follow. A mortar shell fell 
              close by and severely wounded him in the legs, but, although bleeding 
              and suffering intense pain, he refused to withdraw and continued 
              forward. Two hostile machineguns went into action at close range. 
              Braving this grazing fire, he crawled steadily toward the guns and 
              worked his way alone to a shallow draw, where, despite the hail 
              of bullets, he raised himself to his knees and threw a grenade into 
              the nearest machinegun nest, silencing the weapon and killing or 
              wounding all its crew. The second gun was immediately turned on 
              him, but he calmly and deliberately threw a second grenade which 
              rocked the position and killed all 4 Germans who occupied it. As 
              he continued forward he was spotted by an enemy rifleman, who shot 
              him in the arm. Undeterred, he crawled some 20 yards until a third 
              machinegun opened fire on him. By almost superhuman effort, weak 
              from loss of blood and suffering great pain, he again raised himself 
              to his knees and fired a grenade from his rifle, killing 3 of the 
              enemy guncrew and causing the remaining one to flee. With the first 
              objective seized, he was being treated by the company aid man when 
              he observed 1 of his outpost men seriously wounded by a mortar burst. 
              He wrenched himself from the hands of the aid man and began to crawl 
              forward to assist his comrade, whom he had almost reached when he 
              was struck and fatally wounded by an enemy bullet. S/Sgt. Peterson, 
              by his gallant, intrepid actions, unrelenting fighting spirit, and 
              outstanding initiative, silenced 3 enemy machineguns against great

              which hurled him to the overhead and back to the deck. Quickly recovering, 
              he acted on his own initiative to set up a hand-supply ammunition 
              train for the antiaircraft guns. With water and oil rushing in where 
              the port bulkhead had been torn up from the deck, with many of the 
              remaining crewmembers overcome by oil fumes, and the ship without 
              power and listing heavily to port as a result of a second torpedo 
              hit, Lt. Pharris ordered the shipfitters to counterflood. Twice 
              rendered unconscious by the nauseous fumes and handicapped by his

              4th Marine Division, during the Iwo Jima campaign, 15 and 16 March 
              1945. Almost continuously under fire while carrying out the most 
              dangerous volunteer assignments, Pierce gained valuable knowledge 
              of the terrain and disposition of troops. Caught in heavy enemy 
              rifle and machinegun fire which wounded a corpsman and 2 of the 
              8 stretcher bearers who were carrying 2 wounded marines to a forward 
              aid station on 15 March, Pierce quickly took charge of the party, 
              carried the newly wounded men to a sheltered position, and rendered 
              first aid. After directing the evacuation of 3 of the casualties, 
              he stood in the open to draw the enemy's fire and, with his weapon 
              blasting, enabled the litter bearers to reach cover. Turning his 
              attention to the other 2 casualties he was attempting to stop the 
              profuse bleeding of 1 man when a Japanese fired from a cave less 
              than 20 yards away and wounded his patient again. Risking his own 
              life to save his patient, Pierce deliberately exposed himself to 
              draw the attacker from the cave and destroyed him with the last 
              of his ammunition Then lifting the wounded man to his back, he advanced 
              unarmed through deadly rifle fire across 200 feet of open terrain. 
              Despite exhaustion and in the face of warnings against such a suicidal 
              mission, he again traversed the same fire-swept path to rescue the 
              remaining marine. On the following morning, he led a combat patrol 
              to the sniper nest and, while aiding a stricken marine, was seriously 
              wounded. Refusing aid for himself, he directed treatment for the 
              casualty, at the same time maintaining protective fire for his comrades. 
              Completely fearless, completely devoted to the care of his patients, 
              Pierce inspired the entire battalion. His valor in the face of extreme 
              peril sustains and enhances the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval 
              Service.

              June 1944, near Colleville-sur-Mer, France. On D-day, Technician 
              5th Grade Pinder landed on the coast 100 yards off shore under devastating 
              enemy machinegun and artillery fire which caused severe casualties 
              among the boatload. Carrying a vitally important radio, he struggled 
              towards shore in waist-deep water. Only a few yards from his craft 
              he was hit by enemy fire and was gravely wounded. Technician 5th 
              Grade Pinder never stopped. He made shore and delivered the radio. 
              Refusing to take cover afforded, or to accept medical attention 
              for his wounds, Technician 5th Grade Pinder, though terribly weakened 
              by loss of blood and in fierce pain, on 3 occasions went into the 
              fire-swept surf to salvage communication equipment. He recovered 
              many vital parts and equipment, including another workable radio. 
              On the 3rd trip he was again hit, suffering machinegun bullet wounds 
              in the legs. Still this valiant soldier would not stop for rest 
              or medical attention. Remaining exposed to heavy enemy fire, growing 
              steadily weaker, he aided in establishing the vital radio communication 
              on the beach. While so engaged this dauntless soldier was hit for 
              the third time and killed. The indomitable courage and personal 
              bravery of Technician 5th Grade Pinder was a magnificent inspiration

              gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond 
              the call of duty, while pilot of an airplane of Bombing Squadron 
              5, Lt. Powers participated, with his squadron, in 5 engagements 
              with Japanese forces in the Coral Sea area and adjacent waters during 
              the period 4 to 8 May 1942. Three attacks were made on enemy objectives 
              at or near Tulagi on 4 May. In these attacks he scored a direct 
              hit which instantly demolished a large enemy gunboat or destroyer 
              and is credited with 2 close misses, 1 of which severely damaged 
              a large aircraft tender, the other damaging a 20,000-ton transport. 
              He fearlessly strafed a gunboat, firing all his ammunition into 
              it amid intense antiaircraft fire. This gunboat was then observed 
              to be leaving a heavy oil slick in its wake and later was seen beached 
              on a nearby island. On 7 May, an attack was launched against an 
              enemy airplane carrier and other units of the enemy's invasion force. 
              He fearlessly led his attack section of 3 Douglas Dauntless dive 
              bombers, to attack the carrier. On this occasion he dived in the 
              face of heavy antiaircraft fire, to an altitude well below the safety 
              altitude, at the risk of his life and almost certain damage to his 
              own plane, in order that he might positively obtain a hit in a vital 
              part of the ship, which would insure her complete destruction. This 
              bomb hit was noted by many pilots and observers to cause a tremendous 
              explosion engulfing the ship in a mass of flame, smoke, and debris. 
              The ship sank soon after. That evening, in his capacity as Squadron 
              Gunnery Officer, Lt. Powers gave a lecture to the squadron on point-of-aim 
              and diving technique. During this discourse he advocated low release 
              point in order to insure greater accuracy; yet he stressed the danger 
              not only from enemy fire and the resultant low pull-out, but from 
              own bomb blast and bomb fragments. Thus his low-dive bombing attacks 
              were deliberate and premeditated, since he well knew and realized 
              the dangers of such tactics, but went far beyond the call of duty 
              in order to further the cause which he knew to be right. The next 
              morning, 8 May, as the pilots of the attack group left the ready 
              room to man planes, his indomitable spirit and leadership were well 
              expressed in his own words, "Remember the folks back home are counting 
              on us. 1 am going to get a hit if 1 have to lay it on their flight 
              deck.'' He led his section of dive bombers down to the target from 
              an altitude of 18,000 feet, through a wall of bursting antiaircraft 
              shells and into the face of enemy fighter planes. Again, completely 
              disregarding the safety altitude and without fear or concern for 
              his safety, Lt. Powers courageously pressed home his attack, almost 
              to the very deck of an enemy carrier and did not release his bomb 
              until he was sure of a direct hit. He was last seen attempting recovery 
              from his dive at the extremely low altitude of 200 feet, and amid 
              a terrific barrage of shell and bomb fragments, smoke, flame and 
              debris from the stricken vessel.

              On 3 February 1944, this soldier's company was assigned the mission 
              of capturing Hill 175, the key enemy strong point northwest of Cassino, 
              Italy. The enemy, estimated to be at least 50 in strength, supported 
              by machineguns emplaced in 3 pillboxes and mortar fire from behind 
              the hill, was able to pin the attackers down and inflict 8 casualties. 
              The company was unable to advance, but Pfc. Powers, a rifleman in 
              1 of the assault platoons, on his own initiative and in the face 
              of the terrific fire, crawled forward to assault 1 of the enemy 
              pillboxes which he had spotted. Armed with 2 handgrenades and well 
              aware that if the enemy should see him it would mean almost certain 
              death, Pfc. Powers crawled up the hill to within 15 yards of the 
              enemy pillbox. Then standing upright in full view of the enemy gunners 
              in order to throw his grenade into the small opening in the roof, 
              he tossed a grenade into the pillbox. At this close, the grenade 
              entered the pillbox, killed 2 of the occupants and 3 or 4 more fled 
              the position, probably wounded. This enemy gun silenced, the center 
              of the line was able to move forward again, but almost immediately 
              came under machinegun fire from a second enemy pillbox on the left 
              flank. Pfc. Powers, however, had located this pillbox, and crawled 
              toward it with absolutely no cover if the enemy should see him. 
              Raising himself in full view of the enemy gunners about 15 feet 
              from the pillbox, Pfc. Powers threw his grenade into the pillbox, 
              silencing this gun, killing another German and probably wounding 
              3 or 4 more who fled. Pfc. Powers, still acting on his own initiative, 
              commenced crawling toward the third enemy pillbox in the face of 
              heavy machine-pistol and machinegun fire. Skillfully availing himself 
              of the meager cover and concealment, Pfc. Powers crawled up to within 
              10 yards of this pillbox fully exposed himself to the enemy gunners, 
              stood upright and tossed the 2 grenades into the small opening in 
              the roof of the pillbox. His grenades killed 2 of the enemy and 
              4 more, all wounded, came out and surrendered to Pfc. Powers, who 
              was now unarmed. Pfc. Powers had worked his way over the entire 
              company front, and against tremendous odds had single-handedly broken 
              the backbone of this heavily defended and strategic enemy position, 
              and enabled his regiment to advance into the city of Cassino. Pfc. 
              Powers' fighting determination and intrepidity in battle exemplify 
              the highest traditions of the U.S. Armed Forces.

              (then Lieutenant) Preston led PT-489 and PT-363 through 60 miles 
              of restricted, heavily mined waters. Twice turned back while running 
              the gauntlet of fire from powerful coastal defense guns guarding 
              the 11-mile strait at the entrance to the bay, he was again turned 
              back by furious fire in the immediate area of the downed airman. 
              Aided by an aircraft smokescreen, he finally succeeded in reaching

              destroyed the gun, captured its crew and 2 riflemen. Again advancing 
              ahead of his squad in the assault, he was mortally wounded by an 
              enemy rifleman, but as he fell to the ground he threw a handgrenade, 
              killing his opponent. His superb leadership and heroic action at 
              the cost of his life so demoralized the enemy that resistance at 
              this point collapsed, permitting the 2 battalions to continue their 
              advance.

              attack against vital oil installation in Ploesti, Rumania, on 9 
              July 1944. Just after "bombs away," the plane received heavy and 
              direct hits from antiaircraft fire. One crewmember was instantly 
              killed and 6 others severely wounded. The airplane was badly damaged, 
              2 were knocked out, the control cables cut, the oxygen system on 
              fire, and the bomb bay flooded with gas and hydraulic fluid. Regaining 
              control of his crippled plane, 1st Lt. Pucket turned its direction 
              over to the copilot. He calmed the crew, administered first aid, 
              and surveyed the damage. Finding the bomb bay doors jammed, he used 
              the hand crank to open them to allow the gas to escape. He jettisoned 
              all guns and equipment but the plane continued to lose altitude 
              rapidly. Realizing that it would be impossible to reach friendly 
              territory he ordered the crew to abandon ship. Three of the crew, 
              uncontrollable from fright or shock, would not leave. 1st Lt. Pucket 
              urged the others to jump. Ignoring their entreaties to follow, he 
              refused to abandon the 3 hysterical men and was last seen fighting 
              to regain control of the plane. A few moments later the flaming 
              bomber crashed on a mountainside. 1st Lt. Pucket, unhesitatingly 
              and with supreme sacrifice, gave his life in his courageous attempt 
              to save the lives of 3 others.

              predawn attack on a Japanese convoy, 31 July 1944. Boldly penetrating 
              the screen of a heavily escorted convoy, Comdr. Ramage launched 
              a perilous surface attack by delivering a crippling stern shot into 
              a freighter and quickly following up with a series of bow and stern 
              torpedoes to sink the leading tanker and damage the second one. 
              Exposed by the light of bursting flares and bravely defiant of terrific

              Citation: He was platoon leader with Company F, 8th Infantry, on 
              17 November 1944, during the drive through the Hurtgen Forest near 
              Schevenhutte, Germany. The American forces attacked in wet, bitterly 
              cold weather over rough, wooded terrain, meeting brutal resistance 
              from positions spaced throughout the forest behind minefields and 
              wire obstacles. Small arms, machinegun, mortar, and artillery fire 
              caused heavy casualties in the ranks when Company F was halted by 
              a concertina-type wire barrier. Under heavy fire, 1st Lt. Ray reorganized 
              his men and prepared to blow a path through the entanglement, a 
              task which appeared impossible of accomplishment and from which 
              others tried to dissuade him. With implacable determination to clear 
              the way, he placed explosive caps in his pockets, obtained several 
              bangalore torpedoes, and then wrapped a length of highly explosive 
              primer cord about his body. He dashed forward under direct fire, 
              reached the barbed wire and prepared his demolition charge as mortar 
              shells, which were being aimed at him alone, came steadily nearer 
              his completely exposed position. He had placed a torpedo under the 
              wire and was connecting it to a charge he carried when he was severely 
              wounded by a bursting mortar shell. Apparently realizing that he 
              would fail in his self-imposed mission unless he completed it in 
              a few moments he made a supremely gallant decision. With the primer 
              cord still wound about his body and the explosive caps in his pocket, 
              he completed a hasty wiring system and unhesitatingly thrust down 
              on the handle of the charger, destroying himself with the wire barricade 
              in the resulting blast. By the deliberate sacrifice of his life, 
              1st Lt. Ray enabled his company to continue its attack, resumption 
              of which was of positive significance in gaining the approaches

              a counterattack which threatened the position of his company, Pvt. 
              Reese, as the acting squad leader of a 60-mm. mortar squad, displaying 
              superior leadership on his own initiative, maneuvered his squad 
              forward to a favorable position, from which, by skillfully directing 
              the fire of his weapon, he caused many casualties in the enemy ranks, 
              and aided materially in repulsing the counterattack. When the enemy 
              fire became so severe as to make his position untenable, he ordered 
              the other members of his squad to withdraw to a safer position, 
              but declined to seek safety for himself. So as to bring more effective 
              fire upon the enemy, Pvt. Reese, without assistance, moved his mortar 
              to a new position and attacked an enemy machinegun nest. He had 
              only 3 rounds of ammunition but secured a direct hit with his last 
              round, completely destroying the nest and killing the occupants. 
              Ammunition being exhausted, he abandoned the mortar. seized a rifle 
              and continued to advance, moving into an exposed position overlooking 
              the enemy. Despite a heavy concentration of machinegun, mortar, 
              and artillery fire, the heaviest experienced by his unit throughout 
              the entire Sicilian campaign, he remained at this position and continued 
              to inflict casualties upon the enemy until he was killed. His bravery, 
              coupled with his gallant and unswerving determination to close with 
              the enemy, regardless of consequences and obstacles which he faced, 
              are a priceless inspiration to our armed forces.

              Railroad Station, which was strongly defended by 300 determined 
              enemy soldiers with machineguns and rifles, supported by several 
              pillboxes, 3 20mm. guns, 1 37-mm. gun and heavy mortars. While making 
              a frontal assault across an open field, his platoon was halted 100 
              yards from the station by intense enemy fire. On his own initiative 
              he left the platoon. accompanied by a comrade, and continued forward 
              to a house 60 yards from the objective. Although under constant 
              enemy observation. the 2 men remained in this position for an hour, 
              firing at targets of opportunity, killing more than 35 Japanese 
              and wounding many more. Moving closer to the station and discovering 
              a group of Japanese replacements attempting to reach pillboxes, 
              they opened heavy fire, killed more than 40 and stopped all subsequent 
              attempts to man the emplacements. Enemy fire became more intense 
              as they advanced to within 20 yards of the station. From that point 
              Pfc. Reese provided effective covering fire and courageously drew 
              enemy fire to himself while his companion killed 7 Japanese and 
              destroyed a 20-mm. gun and heavy machinegun with handgrenades. With 
              their ammunition running low, the 2 men started to return to the 
              American lines, alternately providing covering fire for each other 
              as they withdrew. During this movement, Pfc. Reese was killed by 
              enemy fire as he reloaded his rifle. The intrepid team, in 21/2 
              hours of fierce fighting, killed more than 82 Japanese, completely 
              disorganized their defense and paved the way for subsequent complete

              Lt. Riordan led 1 of the assault platoons. Attacking Hill 175, his 
              command was pinned down by enemy machinegun fire from the hill and 
              from a pillbox about 45 yards to the right of the hill. In the face 
              of intense fire, 2d Lt. Riordan moved out in full view of the enemy 
              gunners to reach a position from where he could throw a handgrenade 
              into the pillbox. Then, getting to his knees, he hurled the grenade 
              approximately 45 yards, scoring a direct hit. The grenade killed 
              1 and wounded the other 2 Germans in the nest and silenced the gun. 
              Another soldier then cleaned out the enemy pillboxes on the hill 
              itself, and the company took its objective. Continuing the assault 
              into Cassino itself on 8 February 1944, 2d Lt. Riordan and his platoon

              but the numerically superior enemy force was too much for him to

              his heavy radio for communication with American batteries, led them 
              through intense fire in a charge against the objective. Ten German 
              infantrymen in foxholes threatened to stop the assault, but the 
              gallant leader killed them all at point-blank range with rifle and 
              pistol fire and then pressed on with his men to sweep the area of 
              all resistance. Soon afterward he was ordered to seize the defended 
              town of Kressbach. He went to each of the 19 exhausted survivors 
              with cheering words, instilling in them courage and fortitude, before 
              leading the little band forward once more. In the advance he was 
              seriously wounded in the throat by a shell fragment, but, despite 
              great pain and loss of blood, he refused medical attention and continued 
              the attack, directing supporting artillery fire even though he was 
              mortally wounded. Only after the town had been taken and he could 
              no longer speak did he leave the command he had inspired in victory 
              and walk nearly 2 miles to an aid station where he died from his 
              wound. By his intrepid leadership 1st Lt. Robinson was directly 
              responsible for Company A's accomplishing its mission against tremendous 
              odds.

              when his unit attacked the strongly defended Paco Railroad Station 
              during the battle for Manila, Philippine Islands. While making a 
              frontal assault across an open field, his platoon was halted 100 
              yards from the station by intense enemy fire. On his own initiative, 
              he left the platoon, accompanied by a comrade, and continued forward 
              to a house 60 yards from the objective. Although under constant 
              enemy observation, the 2 men remained in this position for an hour, 
              firing at targets of opportunity, killing more than 35 hostile soldiers 
              and wounding many more. Moving closer to the station and discovering 
              a group of Japanese replacements attempting to reach pillboxes, 
              they opened heavy fire, killed more than 40 and stopped all subsequent 
              attempts to man the emplacements. Enemy fire became more intense 
              as they advanced to within 20 yards of the station. Then, covered 
              by his companion, Pvt. Rodriguez boldly moved up to the building 
              and threw 5 grenades through a doorway killing 7 Japanese, destroying 
              a 20-mm. gun and wrecking a heavy machinegun. With their ammunition 
              running low, the 2 men started to return to the American lines, 
              alternately providing covering fire for each other's withdrawal. 
              During this movement, Pvt. Rodriguez' companion was killed. In 2 
              l/2 hours of fierce fighting the intrepid team killed more than 
              82 Japanese, completely disorganized their defense, and paved the 
              way for the subsequent overwhelming defeat of the enemy at this 
              strongpoint. Two days later, Pvt. Rodriguez again enabled his comrades 
              to advance when he single-handedly killed 6 Japanese and destroyed 
              a well-placed 20-mm. gun by his outstanding skill with his weapons,

              the face of tremendous odds, Pvt. Rodriguez, on 2 occasions, materially 
              aided the advance of our troops in Manila.

              Mount Battaglia. Shortly after the company had occupied the hill, 
              the Germans launched the first of a series of determined counterattacks 
              to regain this dominating height. Completely exposed to ceaseless 
              enemy artillery and small-arms fire, Capt. Roeder constantly circulated 
              among his men, encouraging them and directing their defense against 
              the persistent enemy. During the sixth counterattack, the enemy, 
              by using flamethrowers and taking advantage of the fog, succeeded 
              in overrunning the position. Capt. Roeder led his men in a fierce 
              battle at close quarters, to repulse the attack with heavy losses 
              to the Germans. The following morning, while the company was engaged 
              in repulsing an enemy counterattack in force, Capt. Roeder was seriously 
              wounded and rendered unconscious by shell fragments. He was carried 
              to the company command post, where he regained consciousness. Refusing 
              medical treatment, he insisted on rejoining his men. Although in 
              a weakened condition, Capt. Roeder dragged himself to the door of 
              the command post and, picking up a rifle, braced himself in a sitting 
              position. He began firing his weapon, shouted words of encouragement, 
              and issued orders to his men. He personally killed 2 Germans before 
              he himself was killed instantly by an exploding shell. Through Capt. 
              Roeder's able and intrepid leadership his men held Mount Battaglia 
              against the aggressive and fanatical enemy attempts to retake this 
              important and strategic height. His valorous performance is exemplary 
              of the fighting spirit of the U.S. Army.

              in action with superior Japanese enemy aerial and surface forces. 
              While proceeding to attack an enemy amphibious expedition, as a 
              unit in a mixed force, Houston was heavily attacked by bombers; 
              after evading 4 attacks, she was heavily hit in a fifth attack, 
              lost 60 killed and had 1 turret wholly disabled. Capt. Rooks made 
              his ship again seaworthy and sailed within 3 days to escort an important 
              reinforcing convoy from Darwin to Koepang, Timor, Netherlands East 
              Indies. While so engaged, another powerful air attack developed 
              which by Houston's marked efficiency was fought off without much 
              damage to the convoy. The commanding general of all forces in the 
              area thereupon canceled the movement and Capt. Rooks escorted the 
              convoy back to Darwin. Later, while in a considerable American-British-Dutch

              Houston with H.M.S. Exeter carried the brunt of the battle, and 
              her fire alone heavily damaged 1 and possibly 2 heavy cruisers. 
              Although heavily damaged in the actions, Capt. Rooks succeeded in 
              disengaging his ship when the flag officer commanding broke off 
              the action and got her safely away from the vicinity, whereas one-half 
              of the cruisers were ??lost.

              2 verbal requests to accompany the leading assault elements in the 
              Normandy invasion had been denied, Brig. Gen. Roosevelt's written 
              request for this mission was approved and he landed with the first 
              wave of the forces assaulting the enemy-held beaches. He repeatedly 
              led groups from the beach, over the seawall and established them 
              inland. His valor, courage, and presence in the very front of the 
              attack and his complete unconcern at being under heavy fire inspired 
              the troops to heights of enthusiasm and self-sacrifice. Although 
              the enemy had the beach under constant direct fire, Brig. Gen. Roosevelt 
              moved from one locality to another, rallying men around him, directed 
              and personally led them against the enemy. Under his seasoned, precise, 
              calm, and unfaltering leadership, assault troops reduced beach strong 
              points and rapidly moved inland with minimum casualties. He thus

              near St. Jacques, France. At 11:30 a.m. on 30 October 1944, after 
              his company had lost 55 out of 88 men in an attack on an entrenched. 
              full-strength German company of elite mountain troops, Pvt. Ross 
              placed his light machinegun 10 yards in advance of the foremost 
              supporting riflemen in order to absorb the initial impact of an 
              enemy counterattack. With machinegun and small-arms fire striking 
              the earth near him, he fired with deadly effect on the assaulting 
              force and repelled it. Despite the hail of automatic fire and the 
              explosion of rifle grenades within a stone's throw of his position, 
              he continued to man his machinegun alone, holding off 6 more German 
              attacks. When the eighth assault was launched, most of his supporting 
              riflemen were out of ammunition. They took positions in echelon 
              behind Pvt. Ross and crawled up, during the attack, to extract a 
              few rounds of ammunition from his machinegun ammunition belt. Pvt. 
              Ross fought on virtually without assistance and, despite the fact 
              that enemy grenadiers crawled to within 4 yards of his position 
              in an effort to kill him with handgrenades, he again directed accurate 
              and deadly fire on the hostile force and hurled it back. After expending 
              his last rounds, Pvt. Ross was advised to withdraw to the company 
              command post, together with 8 surviving riflemen, but, as more ammunition 
              was expected, he declined to do so. The Germans launched their last 
              all-out attack, converging their fire on Pvt. Ross in a desperate 
              attempt to destroy the machinegun which stood between them and a 
              decisive breakthrough. As his supporting riflemen fixed bayonets 
              for a last-ditch stand, fresh ammunition arrived and was brought 
              to Pvt. Ross just as the advance assault elements were about to 
              swarm over his position. He opened murderous fire on the oncoming 
              enemy; killed 40 and wounded 10 of the attacking force; broke the 
              assault single-handedly, and forced the Germans to withdraw. Having 
              killed or wounded at least 58 Germans in more than 5 hours of continuous 
              combat and saved the remnants of his company from destruction, Pvt. 
              Ross remained at his post that night and the following day for a 
              total of 36 hours. His actions throughout this engagement were an 
              inspiration to his comrades and maintained the high traditions of 
              the military service.

              at Munoz, Luzon, Philippine Islands. While administering first aid 
              on the battlefield, he observed enemy fire issuing from a nearby 
              culvert. Crawling to the culvert with rifle and grenades, he killed 
              3 of the enemy concealed there. He then worked his way across open 
              terrain toward a line of enemy pillboxes which had immobilized his 
              company. Nearing the first pillbox, he hurled a grenade through 
              its embrasure and charged the position. With his bare hands he tore 
              away the wood and tin covering, then dropped a grenade through the

              Ordering several riflemen to cover his further advance, 2d Lt. Rudolph 
              seized a pick mattock and made his way to the second pillbox. Piercing 
              its top with the mattock, he dropped a grenade through the hole, 
              fired several rounds from his rifle into it and smothered any surviving

              in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, 
              from 19 to 21 February 1945. Quick to press the advantage after 
              8 Japanese had been driven from a blockhouse on D-day, Pfc. Ruhl 
              single-handedly attacked the group, killing 1 of the enemy with 
              his bayonet and another by rifle fire in his determined attempt 
              to annihilate the escaping troops. Cool and undaunted as the fury 
              of hostile resistance steadily increased throughout the night, he 
              voluntarily left the shelter of his tank trap early in the morning 
              of D-day plus 1 and moved out under a tremendous volume of mortar 
              and machinegun fire to rescue a wounded marine Iying in an exposed 
              position approximately 40 yards forward of the line. Half pulling 
              and half carrying the wounded man, he removed him to a defiladed 
              position, called for an assistant and a stretcher and, again running 
              the gauntlet of hostile fire, carried the casualty to an aid station 
              some 300 yards distant on the beach. Returning to his platoon, he 
              continued his valiant efforts, volunteering to investigate and apparently 
              abandoned Japanese gun emplacement 75 yards forward of the right 
              flank during consolidation of the front lines, and subsequently 
              occupying the position through the night to prevent the enemy from 
              repossessing the valuable weapon. Pushing forward in the assault 
              against the vast network of fortifications surrounding Mt. Suribachi 
              the following morning, he crawled with his platoon guide to the 
              top of a Japanese bunker to bring fire to bear on enemy troops located 
              on the far side of the bunker. Suddenly a hostile grenade landed 
              between the 2 marines. Instantly Pfc. Ruhl called a warning to his 
              fellow marine and dived on the deadly missile, at-sorbing the full 
              impact of the shattering explosion in his own body and protecting 
              all within range from the danger of flying fragments although he 
              might easily have dropped from his position on the edge of the bunker 
              to the ground below. An indomitable fighter, Pfc. Ruhl rendered 
              heroic service toward the defeat of a ruthless enemy, and his valor, 
              initiative and unfaltering spirit of self-sacrifice in the face 
              of almost certain death sustain and enhance the highest traditions 
              of the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.

              conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call

              fire and a vicious grenade attack, was pinned down. Jumping to his

              Undaunted, Pfc. Ruiz whirled on his assailant and clubbed him down. 
              Then he ran back through bullets and grenades, seized more ammunition 
              and another automatic rifle, and again made for the pillbox. Enemy 
              fire now was concentrated on him, but he charged on, miraculously 
              reaching the position, and in plain view he climbed to the top. 
              Leaping from 1 opening to another, he sent burst after burst into 
              the pillbox, killing 12 of the enemy and completely destroying the

              and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call 
              of duty at Valhey, France. On the afternoon of 14 September 1944, 
              Sgt. Sadowski as a tank commander was advancing with the leading 
              elements of Combat Command A, 4th Armored Division, through an intensely 
              severe barrage of enemy fire from the streets and buildings of the 
              town of Valhey. As Sgt. Sadowski's tank advanced through the hail 
              of fire, it was struck by a shell from an 88-mm. gun fired at a 
              range of 20 yards. The tank was disabled and burst into flames. 
              The suddenness of the enemy attack caused confusion and hesitation 
              among the crews of the remaining tanks of our forces. Sgt. Sadowski 
              immediately ordered his crew to dismount and take cover in the adjoining 
              buildings. After his crew had dismounted, Sgt. Sadowski discovered 
              that 1 member of the crew, the bow gunner, had been unable to leave 
              the tank. Although the tank was being subjected to a withering hail 
              of enemy small-arms, bazooka, grenade, and mortar fire from the 
              streets and from the windows of adjacent buildings, Sgt. Sadowski 
              unhesitatingly returned to his tank and endeavored to pry up the 
              bow gunner's hatch. While engaged in this attempt to rescue his 
              comrade from the burning tank, he was cut down by a stream of machinegun 
              fire which resulted in his death. The gallant and noble sacrifice 
              of his life in the aid of his comrade, undertaken in the face of 
              almost certain death, so inspired the remainder of the tank crews 
              that they pressed forward with great ferocity and completely destroyed 
              the enemy forces in this town without further loss to themselves. 
              The heroism and selfless devotion to duty displayed by Sgt. Sadowski, 
              which resulted in his death, inspired the remainder of his force 
              to press forward to victory, and reflect the highest tradition of 
              the armed forces.

              George T. Sakato distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism 
              in action on 29 October 1944, on hill 617 in the vicinity of Biffontaine, 
              France. After his platoon had virtually destroyed two enemy defense 
              lines, during which he personally killed five enemy soldiers and 
              captured four, his unit was pinned down by heavy enemy fire. Disregarding 
              the enemy fire, Private Sakato made a one-man rush that encouraged 
              his platoon to charge and destroy the enemy strongpoint. While his 
              platoon was reorganizing, he proved to be the inspiration of his 
              squad in halting a counter-attack on the left flank during which 
              his squad leader was killed. Taking charge of the squad, he continued 
              his relentless tactics, using an enemy rifle and P-38 pistol to 
              stop an organized enemy attack. During this entire action, he killed 
              12 and wounded two, personally captured four and assisted his platoon 
              in taking 34 prisoners. By continuously ignoring enemy fire, and 
              by his gallant courage and fighting spirit, he turned impending 
              defeat into victory and helped his platoon complete its mission. 
              Private Sakato's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are

            <p class="medium" align="left">*SALOMON, BEN L. 
            <p class="medium" align="left">Captain Ben L. Salomon was serving at Saipan, in the Marianas Islands 
              on July 7, 1944, as the Surgeon for the 2d Battalion, 105th Infantry 
              Regiment, 27th Infantry Division. The Regiment's 1st and 2d Battalions 
              were attacked by an overwhelming force estimated between 3,000 and 
              5,000 Japanese soldiers. It was one of the largest attacks attempted 
              in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Although both units 
              fought furiously, the enemy soon penetrated the Battalions' combined 
              perimeter and inflicted overwhelming casualties. In the first minutes 
              of the attack, approximately 30 wounded soldiers walked, crawled, 
              or were carried into Captain Salomon's aid station, and the small 
              tent soon filled with wounded men. As the perimeter began to be 
              overrun, it became increasingly difficult for Captain Salomon to 
              work on the wounded. He then saw a Japanese soldier bayoneting one 
              of the wounded soldiers lying near the tent. Firing from a squatting 
              position, Captain Salomon quickly killed the enemy soldier. Then, 
              as he turned his attention back to the wounded, two more Japanese 
              soldiers appeared in the front entrance of the tent. As these enemy 
              soldiers were killed, four more crawled under the tent walls. Rushing 
              them, Captain Salomon kicked the knife out of the hand of one, shot 
              another, and bayoneted a third. Captain Salomon butted the fourth 
              enemy soldier in the stomach and a wounded comrade then shot and 
              killed the enemy soldier. Realizing the gravity of the situation, 
              Captain Salomon ordered the wounded to make their way as best they 
              could back to the regimental aid station, while he attempted to 
              hold off the enemy until they were clear. Captain Salomon then grabbed 
              a rifle from one of the wounded and rushed out of the tent. After 
              four men were killed while manning a machine gun, Captain Salomon 
              took control of it. When his body was later found, 98 dead enemy 
              soldiers were piled in front of his position. Captain Salomon's 
              extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the 
              highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit 
              upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.

              He displayed conspicuous gallantry above and beyond the call of 
              duty in combat on 12 November 1944, near Thionville, France. During 
              an attack on strong hostile forces entrenched on a hill he fearlessly 
              ran up the steep approach toward his objective and set up his machinegun 
              20 yards from the enemy. Realizing it would be necessary to attract 
              full attention of the dug-in Germans while his company crossed an 
              open area and flanked the enemy, he picked up his gun, charged through 
              withering machinegun and rifle fire to the very edge of the emplacement, 
              and there killed 12 German soldiers with devastating close-range 
              fire. He took up a position behind a log and engaged the hostile

              while his comrades attained their objective at the crest of the

              was in charge of a squad of the 2d Platoon in the vicinity of Stolberg, 
              Germany, early in the morning of 24 September 1944, when 2 enemy 
              companies supported by machineguns launched an attack to seize control 
              of an important crossroads which was defended by his platoon. One 
              American squad was forced back, another captured, leaving only S/Sgt. 
              Schaefer's men to defend the position. To shift his squad into a 
              house which would afford better protection, he crawled about under 
              heavy small-arms and machinegun fire, instructed each individual, 
              and moved to the building. A heavy concentration of enemy artillery 
              fire scored hits on his strong point. S/Sgt. Schaefer assigned his 
              men to positions and selected for himself the most dangerous one 
              at the door. With his Ml rifle, he broke the first wave of infantry 
              thrown toward the house. The Germans attacked again with grenades 
              and flame throwers but were thrown back a second time, S/Sgt. Schaefer 
              killing and wounding several. Regrouped for a final assault, the 
              Germans approached from 2 directions. One force drove at the house 
              from the front, while a second group advanced stealthily along a 
              hedgerow. Recognizing the threat, S/Sgt. Schaefer fired rapidly 
              at the enemy before him, killing or wounding all 6; then, with no 
              cover whatever, dashed to the hedgerow and poured deadly accurate 
              shots into the second group, killing 5, wounding 2 others, and forcing 
              the enemy to withdraw. He scoured the area near his battered stronghold 
              and captured 10 prisoners. By this time the rest of his company 
              had begun a counterattack; he moved forward to assist another platoon 
              to regain its position. Remaining in the lead, crawling and running 
              in the face of heavy fire, he overtook the enemy, and liberated 
              the American squad captured earlier in the battle. In all, single-handed 
              and armed only with his rifle, he killed between 15 and 20 Germans, 
              wounded at least as many more, and took 10 prisoners. S/Sgt. Schaefer's 
              indomitable courage and his determination to hold his position at

              the cover of a ditch to engage 4 German snipers who opened fire 
              on the patrol from its rear. Standing erect he walked deliberately 
              30 yards toward the enemy, stopped amid the fire from 4 rifles centered

              for the patrol behind a house chimney, Pfc. Schauer brought him 
              down with another burst. Shortly after, when a heavy enemy artillery 
              concentration and 2 machineguns temporarily halted the patrol, Pfc. 
              Schauer again left cover to engage the enemy weapons single-handed. 
              While shells exploded within 15 yards, showering dirt over him, 
              and strings of grazing German tracer bullets whipped past him at

              only 60 yards from him with a single burst from his BAR, and crumpled

              in the Rykuyu Islands, 7 May 1945. Quick to take action when his 
              company was pinned down in a valley and suffered resultant heavy 
              casualties under blanketing machinegun fire emanating from a high 
              ridge to the front, Pfc. Schwab, unable to flank the enemy emplacement 
              because of steep cliffs on either side, advanced up the face of 
              the ridge in bold defiance of the intense barrage and, skillfully 
              directing the fire of his flamethrower, quickly demolished the hostile 
              gun position, thereby enabling his company to occupy the ridge. 
              Suddenly a second enemy machinegun opened fire, killing and wounding 
              several marines with its initial bursts. Estimating with split-second 
              decision the tactical difficulties confronting his comrades, Pfc. 
              Schwab elected to continue his l-man assault despite a diminished 
              supply of fuel for his flamethrower. Cool and indomitable, he moved 
              forward in the face of a direct concentration of hostile fire, relentlessly 
              closed the enemy position and attacked. Although severely wounded 
              by a final vicious blast from the enemy weapon, Pfc. Schwab had 
              succeeded in destroying 2 highly strategic Japanese gun positions 
              during a critical stage of the operation and, by his dauntless, 
              single-handed efforts, had materially furthered the advance of his 
              company. His aggressive initiative, outstanding valor and professional 
              skill throughout the bitter conflict sustain and enhance the highest 
              traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.

              New Georgia, Solomon Islands, on 29 July 1943. After 27 days of 
              bitter fighting, the enemy held a hilltop salient which commanded 
              the approach to Munda Airstrip. Our troops were exhausted from prolonged 
              battle and heavy casualties, but Lt. Scott advanced with the leading 
              platoon of his company to attack the enemy position, urging his 
              men forward in the face of enemy rifle and enemy machinegun fire. 
              He had pushed forward alone to a point midway across the barren 
              hilltop within 75 yards of the enemy when the enemy launched a desperate 
              counterattack, which f successful would have gained undisputed possession 
              of the hill. Enemy riflemen charged out on the plateau, firing and 
              throwing grenades as they moved to engage our troops. The company 
              withdrew, but Lt. Scott, with only a blasted tree stump for cover, 
              stood his ground against the wild enemy assault. By firing his carbine 
              and throwing the grenades in his possession he momentarily stopped 
              the enemy advance using the brief respite to obtain more grenades. 
              Disregarding small-arms fire and exploding grenades aimed at him, 
              suffering a bullet wound in the left hand and a painful shrapnel 
              wound in the head after his carbine had been shot from his hand, 
              he threw grenade after grenade with devastating accuracy until the 
              beaten enemy withdrew. Our troops, inspired to renewed effort by 
              Lt. Scott's intrepid stand and incomparable courage, swept across 
              the plateau to capture the hill, and from this strategic position 
              4 days later captured Munda Airstrip.

              As 2d Lt. Shea and his company were advancing toward a hill occupied 
              by the enemy, 3 enemy machineguns suddenly opened fire, inflicting 
              heavy casualties upon the company and halting its advance. 2d Lt. 
              Shea immediately moved forward to eliminate these machinegun nests 
              in order to enable his company to continue its attack. The deadly 
              hail of machinegun fire at first pinned him down, but, boldly continuing 
              his advance, 2d Lt. Shea crept up to the first nest. Throwing several 
              hand grenades, he forced the 4 enemy soldiers manning this position 
              to surrender, and disarming them, he sent them to the rear. He then 
              crawled to the second machinegun position, and after a short fire 
              fight forced 2 more German soldiers to surrender. At this time, 
              the third machinegun fired at him, and while deadly small arms fire 
              pitted the earth around him, 2d Lt. Shea crawled toward the nest. 
              Suddenly he stood up and rushed the emplacement and with well-directed 
              fire from his rifle, he killed all 3 of the enemy machine gunners. 
              2d Lt. Shea's display of personal valor was an inspiration to the 
              officers and men of his company.

              Citation: Attached to the 2d Battalion of the 47th Infantry on 26 
              November 1944, for the attack on Frenzenberg Castle, in the vicinity 
              of Weisweiler, Germany, Company K, after an advance of 1,000 yards 
              through a shattering barrage of enemy artillery and mortar fire, 
              had captured 2 buildings in the courtyard of the castle but was 
              left with an effective fighting strength of only 35 men. During 
              the advance, Pfc. Sheridan, acting as a bazooka gunner, had braved 
              the enemy fire to stop and procure the additional rockets carried 
              by his ammunition bearer who was wounded. Upon rejoining his company 
              in the captured buildings, he found it in a furious fight with approximately 
              70 enemy paratroopers occupying the castle gate house. This was 
              a solidly built stone structure surrounded by a deep water-filled 
              moat 20 feet wide. The only approach to the heavily defended position 
              was across the courtyard and over a drawbridge leading to a barricaded 
              oaken door. Pfc. Sheridan, realizing that his bazooka was the only 
              available weapon with sufficient power to penetrate the heavy oak 
              planking, with complete disregard for his own safety left the protection 
              of the buildings and in the face of heavy and intense small-arms 
              and grenade fire, crossed the courtyard to the drawbridge entrance 
              where he could bring direct fire to bear against the door. Although 
              handicapped by the lack of an assistant, and a constant target for 
              the enemy fire that burst around him, he skillfully and effectively 
              handled his awkward weapon to place two well-aimed rockets into 
              the structure. Observing that the door was only weakened, and realizing 
              that a gap must be made for a successful assault, he loaded his 
              last rocket, took careful aim, and blasted a hole through the heavy 
              planks. Turning to his company he shouted, "Come on, let's get them!" 
              With his .45 pistol blazing, he charged into the gaping entrance 
              and was killed by the withering fire that met him. The final assault 
              on Frezenberg Castle was made through the gap which Pfc. Sheridan 
              gave his life to create.

              comrades to withdraw, saying that he would "remain to the end" to 
              provide cover. Although he had to clear two stoppages which impeded 
              the reloading of his weapon, he halted one enemy charge. Hostile 
              troops then began moving in on his left flank, and he quickly shifted

              and strafing mission against the Aparri and Laoag airdromes. While 
              en route to the objective, he observed an enemy twin engine bomber, 
              protected by 12 fighters, flying about 2,500 feet above him and 
              in the opposite direction Although the odds were 13 to 2, Maj. Shomo 
              immediately ordered an attack. Accompanied by his wingman he closed 
              on the enemy formation in a climbing turn and scored hits on the 
              leading plane of the third element, which exploded in midair. Maj. 
              Shomo then attacked the second element from the left side of the 
              formation and shot another fighter down in flames. When the enemy 
              formed for Counterattack, Maj. Shomo moved to the other side of 
              the formation and hit a third fighter which exploded and fell. Diving 
              below the bomber he put a burst into its underside and it crashed 
              and burned. Pulling up from this pass he encountered a fifth plane 
              firing head on and destroyed it. He next dived upon the first element

              Intense hostile machinegun fire pinned down and threatened to annihilate 
              the American unit in an exposed position where frozen ground made 
              it impossible to dig in for protection. Heavy mortar and artillery 
              fire from enemy batteries was added to the storm of destruction

              wounds to aid casualties, carrying 3 wounded squad members to safety 
              behind the lines and returning to continue the battle with renewed 
              determination until ordered to retire for medical treatment. Stouthearted 
              and indomitable in the face of extreme peril, Pvt. Sigler, by his 
              alert initiative, unfaltering leadership, and daring tactics in 
              a critical situation, effected the release of his besieged company 
              from enemy fire and contributed essentially to its further advance 
              against a savagely fighting enemy. His superb valor, resolute fortitude, 
              and heroic spirit of self-sacrifice throughout reflect the highest 
              credit upon Pvt. Sigler and the U.S. Naval Service.

              citation. 1st Lt. Edward A. Silk commanded the weapons platoon of 
              Company E, 398th Infantry, on 23 November 1944, when the end battalion 
              was assigned the mission of seizing high ground overlooking Moyenmoutier 
              France, prior to an attack on the city itself. His company jumped 
              off in the lead at dawn and by noon had reached the edge of a woods 
              in the vicinity of St. Pravel where scouts saw an enemy sentry standing 
              guard before a farmhouse in a valley below. One squad, engaged in 
              reconnoitering the area, was immediately pinned down by intense 
              machinegun and automatic-weapons fire from within the house. Skillfully 
              deploying his light machinegun section, 1st Lt. Silk answered enemy 
              fire, but when 15 minutes had elapsed with no slackening of resistance, 
              he decided to eliminate the strong point by a l-man attack. Running 
              100 yards across an open field to the shelter of a low stone wall 
              directly in front of the farmhouse, he fired into the door and windows 
              with his carbine; then, in full view of the enemy, vaulted the wall 
              and dashed 50 yards through a hail of bullets to the left side of 
              the house, where he hurled a grenade through a window, silencing 
              a machinegun and killing 2 gunners. In attempting to move to the 
              right side of the house he drew fire from a second machinegun emplaced 
              in the woodshed. With magnificent courage he rushed this position 
              in the face of direct fire and succeeded in neutralizing the weapon 
              and killing the 2 gunners by throwing grenades into the structure. 
              His supply of grenades was by now exhausted, but undaunted, he dashed 
              back to the side of the farmhouse and began to throw rocks through 
              a window, demanding the surrender of the remaining enemy. Twelve 
              Germans, overcome by his relentless assault and confused by his 
              unorthodox methods, gave up to the lone American. By his gallant 
              willingness to assume the full burden of the attack and the intrepidity 
              with which he carried out his extremely hazardous mission, 1st Lt. 
              Silk enabled his battalion to continue its advance and seize its 
              objective.

              1945. Citation: He led an attack against a high precipitous ridge 
              defended by a company of enemy riflemen, who were entrenched in 
              spider holes and supported by well-sealed pillboxes housing automatic 
              weapons with interlocking bands of fire. The terrain was such that 
              only 1 squad could advance at one time; and from a knoll atop a 
              ridge a pillbox covered the only approach with automatic fire. Against 
              this enemy stronghold, S/Sgt. Sjogren led the first squad to open 
              the assault. Deploying his men, he moved forward and was hurling 
              grenades when he saw that his next in command, at the opposite flank, 
              was gravely wounded. Without hesitation he crossed 20 yards of exposed 
              terrain in the face of enemy fire and exploding dynamite charges, 
              moved the man to cover and administered first aid. He then worked 
              his way forward and, advancing directly into the enemy fire, killed 
              8 Japanese in spider holes guarding the approach to the pillbox. 
              Crawling to within a few feet of the pillbox while his men concentrated 
              their bullets on the fire port, he began dropping grenades through 
              the narrow firing slit. The enemy immediately threw 2 or 3 of these 
              unexploded grenades out, and fragments from one wounded him in the 
              hand and back. However, by hurling grenades through the embrasure 
              faster then the enemy could return them, he succeeded in destroying 
              the occupants. Despite his wounds, he directed his squad to follow 
              him in a systematic attack on the remaining positions, which he 
              eliminated in like manner, taking tremendous risks, overcoming bitter 
              resistance, and never hesitating in his relentless advance. To silence 
              one of the pillboxes, he wrenched a light machinegun out through 
              the embrasure as it was firing before blowing up the occupants with 
              handgrenades. During this action, S/Sgt. Sjogren, by his heroic 
              bravery, aggressiveness, and skill as a soldier, single-handedly 
              killed 43 enemy soldiers and destroyed 9 pillboxes, thereby paving 
              the way for his company's successful advance.

              during action against enemy Japanese forces on the Asan-Adelup beachhead, 
              Guam, Marianas Islands, 21 -22 July 1944. When the section leader 
              became a casualty under a heavy mortar barrage shortly after landing,

              Valiantly defending this vital position against strong enemy counterattacks 
              during the night, Pfc. Skaggs was critically wounded when a Japanese 
              grenade lodged in his foxhole and exploded, shattering the lower 
              part of one leg. Quick to act, he applied an improvised tourniquet 
              and, while propped up in his foxhole, gallantly returned the enemy's

              on 23 September 1943. Cpl. Slaton was lead scout of an infantry 
              squad which had been committed to a flank to knock out enemy resistance 
              which had succeeded in pinning 2 attacking platoons to the ground. 
              Working ahead of his squad, Cpl. Slaton crept upon an enemy machinegun 
              nest and, assaulting it with his bayonet, succeeded in killing the 
              gunner. When his bayonet stuck, he detached it from the rifle and 
              killed another gunner with rifle fire. At that time he was fired 
              upon by a machinegun to his immediate left. Cpl. Slaton then moved 
              over open ground under constant fire to within throwing distance, 
              and on his second try scored a direct hit on the second enemy machinegun 
              nest, killing 2 enemy gunners. At that time a third machinegun fired 
              on him 100 yards to his front, and Cpl. Slaton killed both of these 
              enemy gunners with rifle fire. As a result of Cpl. Slaton's heroic

              and rifle fire, the 2 rifle platoons which were receiving heavy

              and again take the initiative. Cpl. Slaton withdrew under mortar 
              fire on order of his platoon leader at dusk that evening. The heroic

              fire and determined fighter airplane attacks while returning from 
              a mission over enemy-occupied continental Europe on 1 May 1943. 
              The airplane was hit several times by antiaircraft fire and cannon 
              shells of the fighter airplanes, 2 of the crew were seriously wounded, 
              the aircraft's oxygen system shot out, and several vital control 
              cables severed when intense fires were ignited simultaneously in 
              the radio compartment and waist sections. The situation became so 
              acute that 3 of the crew bailed out into the comparative safety 
              of the sea. Sgt. Smith, then on his first combat mission, elected 
              to fight the fire by himself, administered first aid to the wounded 
              tail gunner, manned the waist guns, and fought the intense flames 
              alternately. The escaping oxygen fanned the fire to such intense 
              heat that the ammunition in the radio compartment began to explode, 
              the radio, gun mount, and camera were melted, and the compartment

              Armed with a bazooka, he defended a key road junction near Rocherath, 
              Belgium, on 17 December 1944, during the German Ardennes counteroffensive. 
              After a heavy artillery barrage had wounded and forced the withdrawal 
              of his assistant, he heard enemy tanks approaching the position 
              where he calmly waited in the gathering darkness of early evening 
              until the 5 Mark V tanks which made up the hostile force were within 
              pointblank range. He then stood up, completely disregarding the 
              firepower that could be brought to bear upon him, and launched a 
              rocket into the lead tank, setting it afire and forcing its crew 
              to abandon it as the other tanks pressed on before Pfc. Soderman 
              could reload. The daring bazookaman remained at his post all night 
              under severe artillery, mortar, and machinegun fire, awaiting the 
              next onslaught, which was made shortly after dawn by 5 more tanks 
              Running along a ditch to meet them, he reached an advantageous point 
              and there leaped to the road in full view of the tank gunners, deliberately 
              aimed his weapon and disabled the lead tank. The other vehicles, 
              thwarted by a deep ditch in their attempt to go around the crippled 
              machine, withdrew. While returning to his post Pfc. Soderman, braving 
              heavy fire to attack an enemy infantry platoon from close range, 
              killed at least 3 Germans and wounded several others with a round 
              from his bazooka. By this time, enemy pressure had made Company 
              K's position untenable. Orders were issued for withdrawal to an 
              assembly area, where Pfc. Soderman was located when he once more 
              heard enemy tanks approaching. Knowing that elements of the company 
              had not completed their disengaging maneuver and were consequently 
              extremely vulnerable to an armored attack, he hurried from his comparatively 
              safe position to meet the tanks. Once more he disabled the lead 
              tank with a single rocket, his last; but before he could reach cover, 
              machinegun bullets from the tank ripped into his right shoulder. 
              Unarmed and seriously wounded he dragged himself along a ditch to 
              the American lines and was evacuated. Through his unfaltering courage 
              against overwhelming odds, Pfc. Soderman contributed in great measure 
              to the defense of Rocherath, exhibiting to a superlative degree

              smashed the savage power of the last great German offensive

              Battalion. Place and date: At Mount Porchia, Italy, 7 January 1944. 
              Entered service at: Odessa, Mo. Birth: Odessa, Mo. G.O. No.. 56, 
              12 July 1944. Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity 
              at risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, in action involving 
              actual conflict. On the night of 7 January 1944, Sgt. Specker, with 
              his company, was advancing up the slope of Mount Porchia, Italy. 
              He was sent forward on reconnaissance and on his return he reported 
              to his company commander the fact that there was an enemy machinegun 
              nest and several well-placed snipers directly in the path and awaiting 
              the company. Sgt. Specker requested and was granted permission to 
              place 1 of his machineguns in a position near the enemy machinegun. 
              Voluntarily and alone he made his way up the mountain with a machinegun 
              and a box of ammunition. He was observed by the enemy as he walked 
              along and was severely wounded by the deadly fire directed at him. 
              Though so seriously wounded that he was unable to walk, he continued 
              to drag himself over the jagged edges of rock and rough terrain 
              until he reached the position at which he desired to set up his 
              machinegun. He set up the gun so well and fired so accurately that 
              the enemy machine-gun nest was silenced and the remainder of the 
              snipers forced to retire, enabling his platoon to obtain their objective. 
              Sgt. Specker was found dead at his gun. His personal bravery, self-sacrifice, 
              and determination were an inspiration to his officers and fellow 
              soldiers.

              November 1944. At 2 p.m., Company G attacked the village of Achain 
              from the east. S/Sgt. Spurrier armed with a BAR passed around the 
              village and advanced alone. Attacking from the west, he immediately 
              killed 3 Germans. From this time until dark, S/Sgt. Spurrier, using 
              at different times his BAR and Ml rifle, American and German rocket 
              launchers, a German automatic pistol, and handgrenades, continued 
              his solitary attack against the enemy regardless of all types of 
              small-arms and automatic-weapons fire. As a result of his heroic 
              actions he killed an officer and 24 enlisted men and captured 2

            <p class="medium" align="left">Rank and organization: Sergeant (then Private First Class), U.S. 
              Army, Company A, 30th Infantry, 3d Infantry Division. Place and 
              date: Near Padiglione, Italy, 23-24 April 1944. Entered service 
              at: Louisville, Ky. Birth: Louisville, Ky. G.O. No.: 78, 2 October 
              1944. Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk 
              of life above and beyond the call of duty. At the start of his company's 
              attack on strongly held enemy positions in and around Spaccasassi 
              Creek, near Padiglione, Italy, on the night of 23-24 April 1944, 
              Pfc. Squires, platoon messenger, participating in his first offensive 
              action, braved intense artillery, mortar, and antitank gun fire 
              in order to investigate the effects of an antitank mine explosion 
              on the leading platoon. Despite shells which burst close to him, 
              Pfc. Squires made his way 50 yards forward to the advance element, 
              noted the situation, reconnoitered a new route of advance and informed 
              his platoon leader of the casualties sustained and the alternate 
              route. Acting without orders, he rounded up stragglers, organized 
              a group of lost men into a squad and led them forward. When the 
              platoon reached Spaccasassi Creek and established an outpost, Pfc. 
              Squires, knowing that almost all of the noncommissioned officers 
              were casualties, placed 8 men in position of his own volition, disregarding 
              enemy machinegun, machine-pistol, and grenade fire which covered 
              the creek draw. When his platoon had been reduced to 14 men, he 
              brought up reinforcements twice. On each trip he went through barbed 
              wire and across an enemy minefield, under intense artillery and 
              mortar fire. Three times in the early morning the outpost was counterattacked. 
              Each time Pfc. Squires ignored withering enemy automatic fire and 
              grenades which struck all around him, and fired hundreds of rounds 
              of rifle, Browning automatic rifle, and captured German Spandau 
              machinegun ammunition at the enemy, inflicting numerous casualties 
              and materially aiding in repulsing the attacks. Following these 
              fights, he moved 50 yards to the south end of the outpost and engaged 
              21 German soldiers in individual machinegun duels at point-blank 
              range, forcing all 21 enemy to surrender and capturing 13 more Spandau 
              guns. Learning the function of this weapon by questioning a German 
              officer prisoner, he placed the captured guns in position and instructed 
              other members of his platoon in their operation. The next night 
              when the Germans attacked the outpost again he killed 3 and wounded 
              more Germans with captured potato-masher grenades and fire from 
              his Spandau gun. Pfc. Squires was killed in a subsequent action.

              1st Battalion, 28th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against 
              enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 
              1945. The first man of his unit to be on station after hitting the 
              beach in the initial assault, Cpl. Stein, armed with a personally 
              improvised aircraft-type weapon, provided rapid covering fire as 
              the remainder of his platoon attempted to move into position. When 
              his comrades were stalled by a concentrated machinegun and mortar 
              barrage, he gallantly stood upright and exposed himself to the enemy's 
              view, thereby drawing the hostile fire to his own person and enabling 
              him to observe the location of the furiously blazing hostile guns. 
              Determined to neutralize the strategically placed weapons, he boldly 
              charged the enemy pillboxes 1 by 1 and succeeded in killing 20 of 
              the enemy during the furious single-handed assault. Cool and courageous 
              under the merciless hail of exploding shells and bullets which fell 
              on all sides, he continued to deliver the fire of his skillfully 
              improvised weapon at a tremendous rate of speed which rapidly exhausted 
              his ammunition. Undaunted, he removed his helmet and shoes to expedite 
              his movements and ran back to the beach for additional ammunition, 
              making a total of 8 trips under intense fire and carrying or assisting 
              a wounded man back each time. Despite the unrelenting savagery and 
              confusion of battle, he rendered prompt assistance to his platoon 
              whenever the unit was in position, directing the fire of a half-track 
              against a stubborn pillbox until he had effected the ultimate destruction 
              of the Japanese fortification. Later in the day, although his weapon 
              was twice shot from his hands, he personally covered the withdrawal 
              of his platoon to the company position. Stouthearted and indomitable, 
              Cpl. Stein, by his aggressive initiative sound judgment, and unwavering 
              devotion to duty in the face of terrific odds, contributed materially 
              to the fulfillment of his mission, and his outstanding valor throughout 
              the bitter hours of conflict sustains and enhances the highest traditions

              Citation. For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk 
              of his life above and beyond the call of duty as commanding officer 
              of the U.S.S. Tirante during the first war patrol of that vessel 
              against enemy Japanese surface forces in the harbor of Quelpart 
              Island, off the coast of Korea, on 14 April 1945. With the crew 
              at surface battle stations, Comdr. (then Lt. Comdr.) Street approached 
              the hostile anchorage from the south within 1,200 yards of the coast 
              to complete a reconnoitering circuit of the island. Leaving the 
              10-fathom curve far behind he penetrated the mined and shoal-obstructed 
              waters of the restricted harbor despite numerous patrolling vessels 
              and in defiance of 5 shore-based radar stations and menacing aircraft. 
              Prepared to fight it out on the surface if attacked, Comdr. Street 
              went into action, sending 2 torpedoes with deadly accuracy into 
              a large Japanese ammunition ship and exploding the target in a mountainous 
              and blinding glare of white flames. With the Tirante instantly spotted 
              by the enemy as she stood out plainly in the flare of light, he 
              ordered the torpedo data computer set up while retiring and fired 
              his last 2 torpedoes to disintegrate in quick succession the leading 
              frigate and a similar flanking vessel. Clearing the gutted harbor 
              at emergency full speed ahead, he slipped undetected along the shoreline, 
              diving deep as a pursuing patrol dropped a pattern of depth charges 
              at the point of submergence. His illustrious record of combat achievement 
              during the first war patrol of the Tirante characterizes Comdr. 
              Street as a daring and skilled leader and reflects the highest credit

              He was a platoon runner, when the unit assembled near Wesel, Germany 
              after a descent east of the Rhine. Attacking along a railroad, Company 
              E reached a point about 250 yards from a large building used as 
              an enemy headquarters and manned by a powerful force of Germans 
              with rifles, machineguns, and 4 field pieces. One platoon made a 
              frontal assault but was pinned down by intense fire from the house 
              after advancing only 50 yards. So badly stricken that it could not 
              return the raking fire, the platoon was at the mercy of German machine 
              gunners when Pfc. Stryker voluntarily left a place of comparative 
              safety, and, armed with a carbine, ran to the head of the unit. 
              In full view of the enemy and under constant fire, he exhorted the 
              men to get to their feet and follow him. Inspired by his fearlessness, 
              they rushed after him in a desperate charge through an increased 
              hail of bullets. Twenty-five yards from the objective the heroic 
              soldier was killed by the enemy fusillades. His gallant and wholly 
              voluntary action in the face of overwhelming firepower, however, 
              so encouraged his comrades and diverted the enemy's attention that 
              other elements of the company were able to surround the house, capturing 
              more than 200 hostile soldiers and much equipment, besides freeing 
              3 members of an American bomber crew held prisoner there. The intrepidity 
              and unhesitating self-sacrifice of Pfc. Stryker were in keeping 
              with the highest traditions of the military service.

              action against enemy Japanese aerial forces in the Solomons Islands 
              area, 7 April 1943. In a daring flight to intercept a wave of 150 
              Japanese planes, 1st Lt. Swett unhesitatingly hurled his 4-plane 
              division into action against a formation of 15 enemy bombers and 
              personally exploded 3 hostile planes in midair with accurate and 
              deadly fire during his dive. Although separated from his division 
              while clearing the heavy concentration of antiaircraft fire, he 
              boldly attacked 6 enemy bombers, engaged the first 4 in turn and, 
              unaided, shot down all in flames. Exhausting his ammunition as he 
              closed the fifth Japanese bomber, he relentlessly drove his attack 
              against terrific opposition which partially disabled his engine, 
              shattered the windscreen and slashed his face. In spite of this,
