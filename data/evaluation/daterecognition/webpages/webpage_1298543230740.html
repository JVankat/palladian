rights and the irrational thoughts and actions of those on the extreme leftist fringes
of the animal rights movement. Many animal rights activists believe that people are
no more important than insects. Some people believe animal rights supersede human

institutionalized for their own protection -- and ours.">

Saving a two-inch "endangered" fish has cost hundreds of thousands of jobs in California 's Central Valley

of California (Davis) Prof. Peter Moyle started the Save the Delta Smelt campaign.&nbsp; The professor admits 
that the smelt has no commercial value, that its life cycle is just one year, and that, even in optimal conditions,
it's prone to extinction anyway.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it must be saved at any cost.&nbsp; That's the mandate of 
the Endangered Species Act.&nbsp; Moyle was successful in convincing the EPA to list the Delta Smelt as endangered 
in 1993.&nbsp; Several court cases later, the obscene cost of saving a fish the professor says has only been
in the Sacramento River delta for 8,000 to 10,000 years is now apparent.<br><br>

Blocking Wind Farms?&nbsp; And Solar?&nbsp; And Geothermal?</b></a>&nbsp; Kansas is ranked second in the 
nation behind Montana for wind energy potential, a fact which should have environmentalists jumping for joy.&nbsp;
Instead, they're trying to block the construction of transmission lines to wind farms in south central Kansas
and north central Oklahoma.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well it all has to do with the lesser prairie chicken.&nbsp;

apparently run through prime breeding territory for the bird.<br><br>

Job and financial losses naturally followed the judge's decision.&nbsp; The smelt isn't the only California 
creature that has been given preferential treatment over man.&nbsp; The well-being of the kangaroo rat has 
been used to stop home development and freeway construction in Southern California.&nbsp; Farmers in the 
northern part of the state have been denied water so the needs of the coho salmon and shortnose suckerfish 
can be served.&nbsp; And in the Inland Empire, the Delhi Sands fly has shut down development and killed 
jobs.<br><br>

Historians have either overlooked or forgotten that sweeping Nazi environmental laws, all signed by Hitler and

racism was rooted in ecology.&nbsp; By the summer of 1935, right before the Nuremberg laws were set up, Nazi 
Germany was by far the greenest regime on the planet.&nbsp; The Animal Protection laws were followed up by a 
strong hunting law for Hermann Goering in 1934.&nbsp; In 1935, Hitler also signed the Reich Nature Protection
Act, the high water mark for Nazi environmentalism.&nbsp; Here is seen the birth of environmental permits, 
environmental impact statements and environmental totalitarianism.<br><br>

<b><a href="http://www.capitalresearch.org/pubs/pubs.asp?ID=89">Animal Rights</a></b>:&nbsp; In 
the last 15 years, Americans have become increasingly aware of the animal rights 
movement.&nbsp; Through demonstrations, boycotts, letter-writing campaigns, criminal and 
terrorist acts, and lurid charges of animal abuse directed at animal researchers, 
livestock and poultry farmers, and others who use animals, animal rights organizations 
are challenging the traditional roles of animals in our&nbsp;lives.<br><br>

Harmful to Animals, Says Animal Rights Godfather</a></b>:&nbsp; Princeton University 
Professor Peter Singer, dubbed the "godfather" of animal rights, says Christianity is 
a "problem" for the animal rights movement.&nbsp; Singer, author of the book "Animal Liberation" 
and a professor of bioethics at Princeton University's Center for Human Values, criticized 
American Christianity for its fundamentalist strain that takes the Bible too "literally"
