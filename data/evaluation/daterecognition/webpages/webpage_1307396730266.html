         <p>[This is a repost from Easter 2005.]</p>
<p><!--114520376617982149-->Happy Easter to all my celebratory Christian readers, and to all those who just enjoy the holiday as well!</p>
<p>One year when my son was little, I spent the week prior to Easter blowing out eggs and dying them. Now that he&#8217;s grown and away, the eggs are packed away in boxes and stored in parts unknown. If I could get my hands on them I&#8217;d photograph them for you, because even all these years later they are beautiful, with dyes both subtle and unsubtle, interesting etched patterns and rainbow effects&#8212;definitely one of my finest crafts hours (to tell the truth, I didn&#8217;t have so many fine crafts hours, although there was also a gingerbread house we made that was stored in the attic and alas, eaten by small creatures&#8211;and not human ones, at that.)</p>
<p>Blown-out eggs are well worth the trouble, and why?  Because they <i>last</i>.  And nothing eats them.  You only have to make them once, and you&#8217;re all set.  They are a bit fragile, but not so very.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my Easter present to you (not that you couldn&#8217;t find it yourself): the <a href="http://www.fabulousfoods.com/holidays/easter/eggdesign/blowneggs.html">instructions for blowing eggs</a>:<span id="more-1947"></span></p>
<p><i>First, you&#8217;ll need to make a tiny pin hole on each end of the egg. A pin works well, or a wooden kitchen skewer or even the tip of a sharp knife. Gently work the tip of the pin/skewer/knife in a circular motion until a tiny hole appears. Repeat on the other side. Then insert the pin or skewer (the knife will be too big here) far enough into the egg to break the yolk. Use your mouth [blow] to expel the contents of the egg.</i></p>
<p>And <a href="http://wiki.ehow.com/Blow-Out-Eggs">here</a> is a more complex&#8211;but perhaps better&#8211;way, for those obsessive-compulsives among us.</p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t mine, but they&#8217;ll have to do as substitute:</p>

			<p>My sis in law put 4 blown eggs into my 4 year old niece&#8217;s room.  My brother heard something happening in the room, and went in to discover my niece about to crush the 4th and last blown eggshell into pieces.  Consequences ensued.  Then my niece, on her own, explained:  &#8220;Sometimes my mind tells me no, but my body just says yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, this means she can never be allowed to date.</p>

			<p>I wonder how many of you Christian or Jewish folks realize the connection between Passover and the cruxification?  [To my Jewish friends, if any of my info regarding what the Jews do is wrong, can you please let me know? Im not asking you to 'accept' or approve the Jesus stuff , I respect your viewpoint regarding Jesus]</p>
<p>Passover was a prophecy for Jesus&#8217; death. Contrary to what most Christians presume, Jesus died on Thursday, Passover.</p>
<p>The Last Supper was the Passover sedar which God commanded to be celebrated annually for all time. It was in this tradition that Jesus instructed his followers to eat and drink for all time.</p>
<p>Per the Jewish calendar, nightfall begins the day, so the Last Supper was Wed night which is the same Jewish day as Thursday during the day.</p>
<p>There are two Sabbaths that week, one on Friday because of Passover and the usual Saturday one.</p>
<p>Thursday is known as Preparation Day. Jesus had to be buried before the Sabbath began Thursday night (which would be Friday)</p>
<p>Mark 15:42<br />
It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body.</p>
<p>And thus being buried before sundown on Thursday is how Jesus fullfilled Passover and fullfilled the prophecy of Jonah.</p>
<p>“For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth”</p>

			<p>Here are some interesting parallels between the instructions given to the Jews regarding Passover in the Book of Exodus and the events of the week of Jesus&#8217; death:</p>
<p>1) Selecting the lamb</p>
<p>Exod. 12:1-5:<br />
The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, &#8220;This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household. If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat. The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.  Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month</p>
<p>Jesus:<br />
On the 10th Day (Sunday), Jesus entered Jerusalem presenting himself as the Messiah. Up through the end of the 13th Jesus was scrutinized by the Jewish leadership and by the 13th they were unable to find fault with any of his answers and they dared not to ask any more questions because they were humiliated as their traps didn&#8217;t work. </p>
<p>Matthew 21:23 Now after Jesus entered the temple courts, the chief priests and elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”  ..<br />
Matthew 22:15 Then the Pharisees went out and planned together to entrap him with his own words.<br />
Matthew 22:22 Now when they heard this they were stunned, and they left him and went away.<br />
Matthew 22:23 The same day Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection)26 came to him<br />
Matthew 22:34 Now when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled together<br />
Matthew 22:46 No one was able to answer him a word, and from that day on no one dared to question him any longer.</p>
<p>So there you can see all the community leaders inspected him and none were able to find any blemish, so by the end of the day on the 13th , the lamb that was presented was not found to have any blemishes.</p>
<p>The 13th Day ends on Wed sundown. The 14th day Starts on Wed Sunday and ends on Thur sundown.</p>
<p>2) The Blood Sacrifice/Angel of Death</p>
<p>Exod. 12:6-11:<br />
Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the people of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight. Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast. Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water, but roast it over the fire-head, legs and inner parts. Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it. This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD&#8217;s Passover. </p>
<p>Jesus:<br />
On Wed night he has the Last Supper with his apostles.  On Thur morning he is arrested, put on trial, condemned to death and then nailed to the cross.  He dies around 3PM on Thursday as it was getting dark.</p>
<p>In Exodus it said: &#8220;Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the same configuration of the crucifixion.</p>
<p>The blood of the lamb protected the Jewish people from the Angel of Death that killed the firstborn of Egypt.  In the same way , Christians believe that acceptance of the blood on the Cross earns God&#8217;s grace from death.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve always understood the Last Supper to have been a Passover Seder, not a big stretch, since we know for sure that Jesus, and most of his followers, were Jews.  The timelines you suggest fit perfectly, probably no coincidence&#8230;  Though I&#8217;ve read a lot, and am not young, I barely dare to comment, since this is outside my focus of studies.  However, as a Jew, I would have to suggest that because both testaments are several thousand years and older, and very difficult to technically and historically verify, that the rest must be an article of faith.  I&#8217;m not really a believer, but more of a&#8230; &#8220;dreaded neocon&#8221;.  At the end of the day, on a very personal level, I don&#8217;t believe in God, just the people that do, along with others with whom we share a common sense of mutual respect, values and minimum standards of ethical behavior.  Faith isn&#8217;t such a bad thing, it gives people inspiration, strength, and a sense of peace; &#8220;Some of my best friends&#8221; are people of faith.  People of faith will save this world, and in so doing they will need every bit of strength that they derive from it.  Happy Easter, thanks for your genuine friendship.</p>

			<p>I understand what you&#8217;re saying.  I&#8217;m not asking anyone to &#8220;believe&#8221; what I wrote..  I only went there because these connections are not widely known and I thought some peolpe might find it interesting.</p>
<p>I totally resepct everyone&#8217;s personal belief, my intention wasn&#8217;t to change them.</p>
<p>There is a Christian Biblical principle regarding the Jewish Biblical Holidays that very few peolpe know because the Western Church was so thoroughly dejudiazed that the insights were lost..</p>
<p>In light of the New Testament , Christians find in the Old Testament extensive prophecies regarding Jesus. </p>
<p>One of these ares concerns the holidays delinated in the Torah.  What we see is that throughout Israel&#8217;s history that very significant national events seem to happen on certain days throughout history.<br />
As such, it&#8217;s reasonable to wonder if the coming and rejection of the Messiah have any connections to the Holy days.</p>
<p>The Spring holidays were fullfilled in Jesus first coming. The Fall holidays are expected to be fullfilled during the End Time when the Jewish people are redeemed by God.  There is a long period of time between the spring and fall holidays.  In the same way that there is a long period of time between the 1st and 2nd Coming.</p>
<p>PASSOVER<br />
(Jewish Meaning) The Jews sacrificed a spotless lamb on the doorposts of their homes. The angel &#8220;passed over&#8221; and spared them but killed the firstborn Egyptians. Exod 12 </p>
<p>(Jesus&#8217; Fulfillment) Jesus was the perfect sacrificial Lamb of God. Symbolized by his death on the cross. We are washed in his blood and freed from our sins. </p>
<p>UNLEAVENED BREAD<br />
(Jewish Meaning) The Jews had to leave so quickly, the bread they took didn&#8217;t have time to rise. They consider the leaven, or yeast, a metaphor for sin. </p>
<p>(Jesus&#8217; Fulfillment) Christ was sanctified, set apart, and sinless. His burial and broken body was symbolic of the true Bread of Heaven. </p>
<p>FIRSTFRUITS<br />
(Jewish Meaning) Firstfruits means, &#8220;a promise to come.&#8221;<br />
(Jesus&#8217; Fulfillment) Jesus rose from the grave</p>
<p>PENTECOST<br />
(Jewish Meaning) 50 days after Passover is the holiday of Pentecost. The Jews remember this day as the time when they crossed the Red Sea. </p>
<p>Exactly 50 days later, Moses descended with the 10 Commandments, the Law written in stone. Moses saw the lawlessness of the Israelites when he came down and told the Levites to kill the troublemakers. <b>3,000 were slain. </b></p>
<p>Exod 32:28<br />
And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about <b>three thousand</b> men. </p>
<p>(Jesus&#8217; Fulfillment) Jesus rose from the grave, and exactly 50 days later, the Holy Spirit was given at Pentecost. Incidentally, 3,000 men were saved that day, and the Law was written on their hearts. </p>
<p>Acts 2:41<br />
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added [unto them] <b>about three thousand souls.</b> </p>
<p>And these are the unfullfilled Fall Holidays that soem believe will be the days that certain events pertaining to the 2nd Coming happen:</p>
<p> FEAST OF TRUMPETS or ROSH HASHANA<br />
(Jewish Meaning) This is the Jewish New Year. Its day is decided by the New Moon observance, therefore the day is unknown until is it confirmed by two witnesses. It is a period of divine judgment in which the fate of the world in the coming year ahead is determined. The trumpet was the signal for the field workers to come into the Temple. The high priest actually stood on the southwestern corner of the Temple and blew the trumpet so it could be heard in the surrounding fields. At that instant the faithful would stop harvesting, even if there were more crops to bring in, and leave immediately for worship service. </p>
<p>On Rosh Hashanah, a series of one hundred trumpet blasts is sounded to announce the setting up of the eternal court, with the trumpets heralding God as the all-seeing, all-knowing Judge of the Universe. Jewish tradition says that this court date is to find out who are righteous and have their names in the Book of Life through the Messiah. All other people are a mixture of good and bad, and God in His mercy will delay their court date for a period of time to allow them to try and prepare a proper defense. The second court date is on Yom Kippur. </p>
<p>(Jesus&#8217; Future Fulfillment) The Rapture of the Church. </p>
<p>1 Thess. 4:16-17<br />
For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpof God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord . </p>
<p>YOM KIPPUR or DAY of ATONEMENT </p>
<p>(Jewish Meaning) Called the &#8220;Day of the Lord.&#8221; It is celebrated as the day when God&#8217;s enemies will be defeated and judgment will occur. It is the last day of the Rosh-Hashanah, and the climax of the &#8220;Days of Awe.&#8221; It is believed that, while judgment on each person is pronounced on Rosh Hashanah, it is not made absolute until Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>The Ten Days are therefore an opportunity to mend one&#8217;s ways in order to alter the judgment in one&#8217;s favor. </p>
<p>(Jesus&#8217; Future Fulfillment) Jesus&#8217; Second Coming. After the Tribulation, the Lord returns in the air with his saints behind him &amp; defeats the antichrist and his armies at armegeddon. </p>
<p>FEAST of TABERNACLES<br />
(Jewish Meaning) Also called the Feast of Booths. It is a remembrance of the 40 years in the wilderness when God lived with them in his own Tabernacle.<br />
(Jesus Future Fulfillment) The 1,000 year Millenium kingdom where the saved live and reign with Christ on Earth in peace.</p>

			<p>Interesting stuff&#8230; it seems to me the big question to ponder in terms of it&#8217;s impact on our personal experience is the nature of the &#8220;timeline&#8221; in the context of the &#8220;end times&#8221;, so-to-speak.  Since biblical times people have, on numbers of occasions, conjectured that they were at that point&#8230; but then life goes on.  Geopolitical events now &#8220;seem&#8221; to corroborate that theme more than ever, so who is the Anti-Christ?  Mo himself, or one of his soldiers, ie. Saddam, Osama, perhaps even  Obama (just kidding, not, think about it&#8230;).  I&#8217;m going to Israel for ten days in early May, to see for myself, and support some people I believe in.  Mo&#8217;s hordes are planning on crashing and squelching the party, perhaps I&#8217;ll be there for the rapture&#8230; But if life only goes on, under the circumstances, that&#8217;s pretty good, don&#8217;t you think?</p>

			<p>You didn&#8217;t, which is prudent, and I&#8217;m partly being playful, but not at all disrespectful.  However, starting with your commentary, &#8220;(Jesus’ Future Fulfillment) The Rapture of the Church&#8221;, the question of a final timeline seems implied, and compelling, even to someone like myself, as events seem to fall into place.  If it&#8217;s simply metaphor, then it&#8217;s still a gift of hope for many&#8230;</p>

<p>As one who has read the Qur&#8217;an, as also I have the Old and New Testaments and studied theology when I was a Jesuit seminarian (I left before making it to Ordination), I have become convinced that Allah is Satan and that Islam is the Beast.  It is far more powerful than Communism/Marxism ever were or could be.  The viciousness of this cult, and its historic evil, are unmatched in history.</p>
<p>Did you know that it is CONSERVATIVELY estimated that in over fourteen hundred years of jihad history Islam has murdered over 270 million human beings?  They did the low tech way.  And if Iran gets the bomb and if the jihadis in Pakistan get control over the nukes that death toll is going to go up a lot more.</p>
<p>But, let us not dwell exclusively on this morose fact.  Happy and Blessed Easter to all, even those who are not Christians.</p>
<p>That was very good news about Magdi Allam and his baptism by Benedict XVI.  Unfortunately, it only pisses off the jihadis even more than they are already furious with him.  And it makes the Church even more of a target for these 7th century savages.</p>

			<p>And what I was going to say was&#8230; I have chickens that lay green eggs.</p>
<p>The colors are subtle but they are laying white, light brown, and soft blue and green eggs, which are very pretty.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t do anything with them this year but in the past I&#8217;ve blown them out (and yes, had many broken by horrible children who were sitting on them!) and kept them.   I was getting extra dark brown ones then, too.</p>
<p>When hens first start to lay their eggs are smaller, so I saved the half-sized eggs to blow out and keep.</p>

			<p>Vince, yes&#8230; signed up for a typical 6 day tourist group bus trip, then spend two days (around Tel Aviv area) myself before returning to NYC.  I originally got the idea from a trip sponsored by a group called FLAME, an Israel advocacy group in San Francisco, that I ran into on the web, which included meetings with government and business  people, a visit to Sderot, and even a P.A. representative.  Signed up, and made my NYC flight reservations, but then FLAME canceled their trip due to lack of response, only ten people&#8230; So I figured what the hell, I&#8217;d go myself anyway.  Am expecting, hoping, that the travel group will end up being more internationally diverse and interesting after all&#8230;  It should still be quite interesting, perhaps a little less &#8220;serious&#8221;.  After all, Sports Illustrated does a lot of swim suit shoots in Israel, check out their recent stuff on the internet, and Tel Aviv is the NYC of the mideast, in the sense of business, diversity and the arts.</p>

			<p>Truth:  Muslims themselves make the association between the Antichrist and the Mahdi.  How can you say I&#8217;m being hateful merely for reading what Muslims say about their own view?</p>
<p>Muslims seem to think that NonMuslims taking them at their word is an expression of hate.</p>
<p>I have to laugh at how insecure Muslims are&#8230; breaking down in hysterics because people speak the truth about thier religion</p>
<blockquote>
<p> As such there exists a tradition within Islamic scholarship that seeks to extract those portions of the Bible that Muslims feel may be untainted by the corrupting influence of Jews and Christians.  </p>
<p>These Judeo-Christian traditions are called by Muslims, isra’iliyyat.  One such transmitter of biblical traditions is Muslim scholar Ka’b al-Ahbar.  He is viewed among Muslims as a trustworthy transmitter of Hadith as well as isra’iliyyat. 31 </p>
<p>Ka’b al-Ahbar is supported in his view that this description of the rider on the white horse as found in the Book of Revelation is indeed the Mahdi by two well known Egyptian authors, Muhammad Ibn ‘Izzat and Muhammad ‘Arif in their book Al Mahdi and the End of Time.  ‘Izzat and Arif quote Ka’b al Ahbar as saying:</p>
<p>I find the Mahdi recorded in the books of the Prophets… For instance, the Book of Revelation says: “And I saw and behold a white horse.  He that sat on him…went forth conquering and to conquer.” 32</p>
<p>‘Izzat and ‘Arif then go on to say:</p>
<p>It is clear that this man is the Mahdi who will ride the white horse and judge by the Qur’an (with justice) and with whom will be men with marks of prostration on their foreheads [Marks on their foreheads from bowing in prayer with their head to the ground five times daily]. 33</p>
<p>It is said by some that it was for this reason that Saddam Hussein had numerous murals painted all over Baghdad portraying himself as a Muslim Knight on a white horse with sword drawn doing valiant battle against the infidels. 34</p>

			<p>Antichrist and the Mahdi</p>
<p>1-	You repeatedly saying you read Quran and Sunnh, did you have any references to Mahdi in both of them?</p>
<p>2-	Mahdi only “believed” crated by part of Shiites group “not all of them” as of Muslims Shiites represent 10%-20% of total Muslims, and then you can not use it as Islam religion things.</p>
<p>3-	Quran is the main reference to Muslims, if there is any differences or argument related to any matter Quran is the final judgment.</p>
<p>There are many things taken or considered by not Muslims and some who trying to use them against Islam and Muslims by representing them as an Islamic material which is “NOT” in any way in any Quranic teaching or Quranic orders.</p>
<p>There are many examples the one you put is one of.</p>

<p>Apparently our discussion has snagged a Muslim troll.  Beware of taqiyya and kitman, everyone.  It&#8217;s amazing how they find our kafir discussions about their &#8220;religion&#8221; across the entire web.  I participate at jihadwatch.org and fallbackbelmont.blogspot.com and it never fails that these guys find us when we are discussing their scriptures and their historic behavior.  They are well financed and, I am sure, have a lot of people who can devote time going on the offensive against Islam&#8217;s critics.</p>

			<p>&#8220;A Study of Mithraism&#8221;<br />
[13 September-23 November 1949]<br />
[Chester, Pa.]</p>
<p>During the first semester of his second year at Crozer, King wrote this paper for Enslin&#8217;s course on Greek religion. Mithraism, a sect of Zoroastrianism characterized by the worship of Mithra as the defender of the truth, was a monotheistic mystery religion prevalent in the ancient Roman empire before the acceptance of Christianity in the fourth century. Followers of Mithra became less common after the Roman emperors banned their cults, and Christianity gained the popularity once belonging to Mithraism.</p>

			<p>VinceP,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really new here, so I was not familiar with &#8220;Truth.&#8221;  It&#8217;s just that his rickety defense of Islam struck me as very typical of what I see elsewhere.  So, I thought he was a Muslim.  My bad&#8230;</p>
<p>I was aware that the teaching about the Mahdi is a Shia &#8220;innovation.&#8221;  The Sunni hold no such views.  But, to the overly literal Sunni a Shia cleric could say, &#8220;Well, on the Judgment Day WHO ELSE IS GONNA SHAKE THE TREE AND SORT &#8216;EM OUT?&#8221;</p>
<p>What most disturbs me:  in Europe and North America people are so secularized and so alienated from our traditional Christian and Jewish roots that knowledge of scripture and theology is extremely deficient.  So deficient that hardly anyone can think lucidly about this stuff and sort out the all the free floating detritus of bad faith criticisms of our civilization and traditions out there.  And it is even more telling when, so bereft of a solid grounding in scripture and theology, people will criticize critics of Islam by resorting to the argument by moral equivalency between Islam and Christianity.  They are clueless as to how foolish their arguments are, but we have to deal with those arguments anyway in order to keep the conversation on honest and solid footing.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve read some pretty interesting theories that specificly tie shia Islam to the End Time empire. I&#8221;ll have to find it.</p>
<p>If that view was the one that ended up unfolding then it would fit perfectly with the current situation with Islam..  the shiis waiting for the mahdi to return.  a civil war between sunnis and shiis.. saudi arabia and the world&#8217;s oil supply destroyed.. the shiit mahdi controlling the little oil that is left.</p>
<p>In Ezekiel there&#8217;s a prophecy about Gog/Magog.  Most of the nations listed are today all shiite muslim strongholds.  There&#8217;s an arc of Shiias from Persia up to the caucuses down through turkey into syria and into lebanon.  all the non-african nations in Ezekiel 38 fall in that arc.</p>

<p>Talking about religions here, you should understand there are elements of local culture/ local attitudes very mixed with Islam and other religions for the western they take it as Islamic religious teaching, the fact is the main constitution and commitments is Koran, Koran the only reference to Islam and what other things considered to help, describe and simplifying the Koranic teaching, thus they are in line with Koran.</p>

			<p><b><a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/19800426/19800426said" rel="nofollow">Islam Through Western Eyes</a></b><br />
 <i>Edward W. Said</i>,  <i>January 1, 1998</i></p>
<blockquote><p>So far as the United States seems to be concerned, it is only a slight overstatement to say that Moslems and Arabs are essentially seen as either oil suppliers or potential terrorists. Very little of the detail, the human density, the passion of Arab-Moslem life has entered the awareness of even those people whose profession it is to report the Arab world. What we have instead is a series of crude, essentialized caricatures of the Islamic world presented in such a way as to make that world vulnerable to military aggression.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To the extent that Islam is known about today, it is known principally in the form given it by the mass media: not only radio, films and Tv but also textbooks, magazines and best-selling, high-quality novels. This corporate picture of Islam on the whole is a depressing and misleading one. What emerges is that Ayatollah Khomeini, Col. Muammar e-Qaddafi, Sheik Ahmad Zaki Yamani and Palestinian terrorists are the best-known figures in the foreground, while the background is populated by shadowy (though extremely frightening) notions about jihad, slavery, subordination of women and irrational violence combined with extreme licentiousness. If you were to ask an average literate Westerner to name an Arab or Islamic writer, or a musician, or an intellectual, you might get a name like Kahlil Gibran in response, but nothing else. In other words, whole swatches of Islamic history, culture and society simply do not exist except in the truncated, tightly packaged forms made current by the media.</p></blockquote>

			<p><i>Critics of individual rights also dismissed them as a distraction from higher social aims. For Marx the idea of universal human rights was merely a bourgeois concern. Hunt notes &#8220;Socialist and Communist organizations inevitably downgraded the importance of rights as a goal.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>Despite its opponents, the concept of human rights triumphed with the United Nations&#8217; Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. But clearly &#8220;the hope of stopping barbarous ‘acts&#8217; has not been fulfilled,&#8221; Hunt writes. &#8220;South Africa, the French in Algeria, Chile, Greece, Argentina, Iraq, the Americans at Abu Ghraib &#8212; the list never ends.&#8221; </i></p>

			<p>Hey &#8220;Truth&#8221;</p>
<p>Just a rebuttal to your wild claim that I do not know Islam or Muslims.  Besides having read the Qur&#8217;an, which most Muslims have not done, I have had many Muslim acquaintances.  In college, during my last two years one of my roommates in our off campus apartment was a devout Shia Muslim from Tehran (1980-82).  One of my economics professors when I was an undergrad at UNH was a Christian Iranian.  And while I was an undergrad I knew many Muslims through my roommate, some of them had to flee Iran because they were Muslim apostates and were Communists or socialists &#8211; Khomeini had turned viciously on those people after they had helped the revolution.</p>
<p>Years later in my M.B.A. program at Boston College (after I had left the Society of Jesus) one of my professors in Finance was a Sunni from UAE.  And I met and knew many grad students who were Muslim.</p>

			<p>Edward Said&#8217;s orientalist approach to describing Islam is increasingly discredited because of the many inaccuracies contained in his writings.  Also, Said himself has been, at times, untruthful about his own background.</p>
<p>As such, I am very, very concerned about Barack Obama&#8217;s acquaintance with Edward Said and his academic disciples.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Truth&#8221; is playing pretend, afraid to face the truth; Real truth is freedom of religion &amp; freedom of the press, equal opportunity regardless of race, creed, color or sex, no double standards, no double standards, no double standards, no submission, ever&#8230;</p>
<p>From Atlas today:<br />
&#8220;An Unlikely Refuge: Muslims Fleeing Darfur Rebuilding Lives in Israel &#8211; Seth Freedman<br />
&#8220;Even though we&#8217;re Muslim, the Islamic world has done nothing to protect us,&#8221; said Yassin, one of the first Darfurians to make it into Israel across the border from Egypt and now director of Bnei Darfur [Sons of Darfur], which assists Sudanese refugees to integrate into Israeli society. &#8220;All of the Arab countries support the government of Sudan &#8211; our problem is with the Arab League,&#8221; he said. As far as Yassin is concerned, Israel has provided for his people in a way that no Arab country would &#8211; and for that he&#8217;s eternally grateful. (Guardian-UK)&#8221;</p>

			<p>Abu Graib on it&#8217;s very *worst* day under Americans was better by far than on *any* day while operated by Saddam.</p>
<p>When we arrived and began to clean up in order to use the prison we found a building so soaked in human blood that the US commander felt it too psychologically damaging to require soldiers to clean it and ordered it bulldozed.</p>
<p>Under the Americans and the incompetent then-General Karpinski, a couple of soldiers humiliated prisoners for kicks and giggles.  Even if those soldiers were not arrested, tried, convicted and sent to prison Abu Graib under American control would STILL not compare in any way to the violations of human rights and dignity that occurred before we got there.</p>
<p>I agree with whomever said to Truth&#8230; when Arabs start enforcing human rights THEN they can complain.  Until then they&#8217;ve got no right.</p>
