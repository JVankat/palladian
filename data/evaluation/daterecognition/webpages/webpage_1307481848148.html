					<b>Background</b>
					<p>
					Billow Butler & Company, L.L.C. (BBC) is a middle market investment bank dedicated to advising business owners on the sale of their companies.  Our clients are located across the U.S. and typically own companies valued up to $100 million.  They are entrepreneurs and private equity groups that intend to sell an entire company or larger, public companies that desire to divest a division.  But, no matter their size, location or ownership, our clients engage us with a common goal in mind - maximize net proceeds, to ensure transaction closure and achieve the best possible terms with confidentiality, speed and minimal burden on themselves and their corporate staff.
					<p>
					<b>What Distinguishes Us From Our Peers</b>
					<p>
					Our greatest asset at BBC is our name and reputation for integrity and results.  Over the years, several factors have contributed to our own success and the success we've achieved on behalf of our clients:
					<p>
					<table cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 border=0 width="90%" align=center>

					<td class="text">
					<b>Our People</b> -- Firms do not close deals...dealmakers close deals.  No matter the size or reputation of an investment bank, the fate of any deal is determined by the skills and teamwork of a group of three to four dealmakers who execute the transaction.  
					<p>
					With world-class professional backgrounds in law, finance and accounting, our professionals are uniquely qualified to run a competitive marketing process, facilitate smooth due diligence proceedings, coordinate contract construction and negotiate optimal terms on our clients' behalves.  We bring a level of expertise, commitment and professionalism to the middle market that has traditionally been available only to companies engaged in much larger transactions.  We have each been honored repeatedly with the highest accolades awarded by our former colleagues and are proud to have collectively served in over 300 transactional assignments.
					<p>
					A wealth of negotiating experience, along with an in-depth understanding of the regulatory, legal and tax issues necessary to structure a successful transaction sets our professionals apart.  Prior to joining BBC, each of our professionals spent considerable time executing large, corporate transactions at the nation's most prominent law firms, investment banks, commercial banks and financial consulting firms.  Our Managing Directors average over 10 years of deal experience and have collectively engineered hundreds of successful transactions - some exceeding a billion dollars.  This pool of transaction experience serves as an "insurance policy" for our clients so that a proposed transaction survives the scrutiny of due diligence and closes according to the initially agreed upon terms.  
					<p>
					<b>Our Proven Track Record</b> -- We have a long track record of closing deals at prices that meet or exceed the top end of our clients' expectations.  Over 85% of our transactions have involved strategic buyers or private equity groups with existing holdings in our clients' respective industries.  As a result, we are able to achieve synergistic pricing based on the complementary nature of the combined entity.  This, coupled with our proven ability to close deals in the face of challenging circumstances, provides our clients comfort during the sometimes emotionally challenging sale process.  
					<p>
					<b>Our Focus</b> -- The term "investment banking" can comprise a wide array of different services and too often, investment banks attempt to be all things to all people.  However, at BBC we ascribe to the philosophy of "know what you do and do what you know."  Accordingly, we are exclusively devoted to business sales, divestitures and recapitalizations.  In addition to allowing us to maintain a sharpened skill set, this dedication also eliminates the potential conflict that occurs when representing both buyers and sellers.  We are proud to offer our clients an assemblage of proven skills, resourceful experience and energetic drive that has resulted in success for all of our past clients, deal after deal and year after year.
					<p>
					<b>Our Size</b> -- Unlike larger investment banks that work on hundreds of transactions per year, but where only the largest deals receive senior level attention, we take on only a select number of transactions at a given time and devote senior level attention to every deal.  Each deal is led by a Managing Director and supported by  Vice-Presidents, other Managing Directors, Associates and the resources of the entire firm.  From buyer screening through due diligence, a seasoned Managing Director is immersed in the marketing of the transaction and in active communication with our client.
