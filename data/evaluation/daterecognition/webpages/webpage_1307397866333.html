<div class="PostContent">
<p>Chester Carlson inventor of xerography founded the Haloid Company on April 18, 1935. The company manufactured and sold photographic paper! It was based in Rochester New York.</p>
<p>In the year 1942 Carlson received U.S. patent No. 2,297,691 on Oct. 6 for electrophotography, later called xerography, the technology that revolutionized the world of imaging.</p>
<p>Xerox as it is known today was trademarked in 1948 when Haloid and Battelle Development Corp. announced the development of xerography.</p>
<p>The first ever copier- Model A or Ox Box, based on xerography was given to the world by Xerox in the year 1949! Today it manufactures printers for office and home use as well as high volume printers, wide format printers and digital printing presses and afcoarse all the supplies that go with these equipments! They also provide services such as document management, assessment and asset management services among a number of other services!</p>
<p>Xerox pioneered work on the carbon-based organic toner during the 1950&#8217;s and today it boasts of developing a chemically grown toner &#8211; Emulsion Aggregation, in short Xerox has been and still is the market leader in copiers, toners and Inks!</p>
<p>It is No.1 in digital production color and No. 2 in office color. Xerox also manufactures compatible cartridges and claims to be a high quality alternative to Hewlett-Packard cartridges!<br />
Xerox manufactures and markets a range of   monochrome and colored copiers, fax machines, printers and presses.</p>
<p>Technology:</p>
<p>Xerox Research Center Canada conducts fundamental and applied materials research in toners, inks, photoreceptors and specialty substrates to support xerographic and direct printing technologies.</p>
<p>Solid Ink </p>
<p>Solid ink remains in solid form until heated to a very specific temperature so that it turns to liquid, then instantly turns back to solid when printed. A precise stainless steel print head with tiny holes smaller than a human hair applies the solid ink to the printing media. The print head houses 1,236 nozzles jetting more than 30 million drops per second. The print head jets the ink to a heated drum where it remains in a malleable state that ensures precise transfer to the paper. <br />
This reduces the amount of ink that is absorbed into the paper fibers and controls dot spread. </p>
<p>The brain behind such precise control is the Phaser controller, which is based on a 600 MHz processor and a high-speed 64-bit bus. </p>
<p>A solid ink printer consists of only three major components- the print head that applies ink to print drum, the print drum that transfers image to paper and the controller, which is the brain of the printer that converts data from the computer to information required to print the image on paper. Add a cabinet and a paper tray and you have a solid ink printer.</p>
<p>With print speeds up to 30 pages per minute, and first-page-out within six seconds, the solid ink printer can be three times faster than a comparably priced laser printer.<br />
Advantages of solid ink printers is they give outstanding print quality, 90% less waste as compared to other competitive printers in the market, prints up to 16 pages on a single sheet saving paper and it is Energy Star compliant.</p>
<p>Emulsion Aggregation Toner </p>
<p>It is the breakthrough technology developed by Xerox Research Center Canada and patented by Xerox. This technology uses a chemical process to grow toner particles with well-defined shapes.</p>
<p>Extremely tiny particles of the components that make up toner are placed together in a water-based environment and allowed to bond, and then grow. This simplifies the control of the size and shape of toner particles. Once the particles reach their target size, they are removed from the growth environment. This growth process of completely organic matter requires fewer steps and consumes less energy, making it much more environmentally friendly. </p>
<p>One major advantage is that cost is not a limiting factor in manufacturing EA toner owing to the fact that there is no exponential relation between cost and toner particle size! Moreover, this in turn is due to very less energy consumption during the particle growth phase.</p>

<p>Ok so maybe the title of this article is a bit misleading but really it was meant to attract you the reader to this article. Of course there is some sort of ink or chemical needed for any printing but what the title really wanted to say was printing without you having to use ink.</p>
<p>Printing is a very old technology. Over the many years that human being knew how to print the printing technology has advanced significantly. At first printing was very slow and only black and white. Printing was limited in resolution and was really used just to print short text messages. Later on the process has been improved allowing faster printing of complete books and eventually it improved all the way to today color super fast printing machines.</p>
<p>What has not changed for many years is the fact that printing requires some sort of ink. The definition of ink can be broadened to basically include any perishable substance that is used in the process of printing with the purpose of creating the printed dots on the print object being paper or any other object. When using the word ink most people think about black dirty material that usually ends up spilled on your hands or that one white shirt that you now need to take to the dry cleaners. </p>
<p>But in the modern era ink can actually take the shape of high tech relatively clean material. For example inkjet printers use ink cartridges that include special material as ink. That special ink is a high technology material that is electrically charged and then accurately placed on the paper using a high tech printing head that uses electricity to release the exact amount of ink at the exact time. Holding an ink cartridge is completely safe and clean. There are no spills and it is not dirty. In fact it is hard to get ink out of the cartridge without the electronic circuitry that the printer uses in conjunction with the cartridge. The tiny holes from which the electrically charged ink leaves the cartridge are too small for any ink to be released without the proper electrical charge. </p>
<p>Yet another form of ink is chemicals that are pre coated on the printing paper. Although this might not seem like ink it is really ink that is utilized in a reverse order. Instead of the printer placing ink on paper the paper is pre coated with ink and then the printer manipulates that ink in order to create the effects needed. Such process is most common when printing digital photos on digital photo paper. Such ink is very clean too. Touching a photo paper would not stain your hands or your clothes. When put in a printer the photo paper is heated up changing the ink qualities and making it ready for the brightness and color transformations needed for the specific print. As can be seen ink can come in many forms and shapes. From the old dirty ink to modern super clean high technology ink cartridges used by modern fast printers.</p>

<p>Air Hockey Tables</p>
<p>A normal air hockey table consists of a large smooth playing area, encompassed by a rail to prevent the puck and mallets from leaving the table, and slots in the rail at either end of the table that serve as goals. On the ends of the table behind and below the goals, there is an area to retrieve the puck after a goal. Also, tables will usually have machinery that produces a cushion of air on the play surface through tiny holes, with the purpose of reducing friction and increasing play speed.</p>
<p>Sometimes the machinery is deleted altogether in favor of a slick table surface, usually plastic, generally these are your cheaper models. One thing to note is that there are also pucks that use a battery and fan to generate their own air cushion, but they tend to break so they are commonly marketed only as toys.</p>
<p>USAA (United States Air-Table-Hockey Association) currently approves only the 8-foot tables manufactured by Dynamo for tournament play. Approved tables include the Photon, Pro-Style, older Blue Top, Brown Top, Purple Top or Black Top with unpainted rails.</p>
<p>A mallet is usually nothing more than a handle attached to a flat surface that lies flush with the surface of the table.</p>
<p>Thin discs of lexan polycarbonate resin are used as the hockey pucks. USAA approved pucks must be either yellow lexan, red lexan or the dynamo green. </p>
<p>
Basic rules</p>
<p>Here are some basic rules as defined by the USAA:</p>
<p> * A face-off or coin toss decides which player gets the first possession of the puck.<br />
 * The first person to score 7 points by shooting the puck into the opponent&#8217;s goal wins the game. When the puck breaks the horizontal plane inside the goal, a point is counted, whether or not captured by the electronic scoring device.<br />
 * Once the puck is on a certain player&#8217;s side of the center line, he/she has 7 seconds to hit the puck back across the center line. Otherwise a foul is committed and the opponent receives possession of the puck.<br />
 * Placing one&#8217;s mallet on top of the puck, known as topping, is a foul. Here the opponent receives possession of the puck.<br />
 * A player cannot touch or strike the puck with any part of his/her body or with any object other than the mallet. Doing so causes a foul and possession changes hands.<br />
 * If the puck is on a clear path into the goal and the player stops it with anything other than the mallet, this is goal tending. Here the opponent receives a free shot.<br />
 * Hitting the puck when it is on the opposite side of the center line, or crossing the center line completely with one&#8217;s mallet causes a foul. Here the opponent receives possession of the puck.<br />
 * If the puck leaves the table, a foul is called on the player that caused the puck to go out of play due to offensive motion and the opposing player gets possession of the puck. Generally, when a player causes the puck to leave the table with a forward motion of the mallet, even defensively (known as charging), the foul is charged on them. An out of play foul results in the opponent receiving possession of the puck.</p>
<p>Game Play</p>
<p>Competitive (tournament) play is usually distinguished by the following:</p>
<p> * The mallet is gripped behind the knob using one&#8217;s fingertips, not on top of it. This allows more wrist action and helps the player to move the mallet around the table faster.</p>
<p> * For basic defense, the mallet is kept centered at least 8 inches out from the goal. In this position, very slight movements to the left and right will block virtually all straight shots. To block bank shots, one pulls back quickly to the corners of the goal. This is known as the &#8220;triangle defense&#8221;.</p>
<p> * Shots are often hit out of &#8220;drifts&#8221;, where the puck travels in set patterns designed to throw off the opponent&#8217;s expectations and timing. The most popular drifts are the &#8220;center&#8221;, &#8220;diamond&#8221;, &#8220;diagonal&#8221;, and &#8220;L&#8221;.</p>
<p> * Shots are often organized into &#8220;combos&#8221;, meaning groups of shots which are hit with the same apparent delivery but opposite directions, caused by hitting the puck at slightly different locations on the mallet. For example, a transverse motion of the right arm can lead to a &#8220;cut shot&#8221; to the left corner of the opponent&#8217;s goal or a &#8220;right wall under&#8221; (bank off the right wall, into the right corner of the opponent&#8217;s goal).</p>

<div class="PostContent">
<p>First impressions</p>
<p>When you unpack an iMac, your first reaction is to treat it with respect. The sheer style and build quality of the aluminium and glass body with its finely engineered stand are unique among desktop computers. </p>
<p>Place the iMac on your desk and your automatic response is to take a step back and admire it. There isn&#8217;t a single thing to break the smooth lines except the discretely mounted iSight camera at the top of the screen. The power button and the sockets are at the back; the stereo speakers lie underneath; the optical disc drive is situated neatly on the side; and the camera&#8217;s microphone is beneath a set of tiny holes drilled into the top. The iMac is ahead of the game when it comes to being sleek and stylish.</p>
<p>Quality and style extend to the Apple Mighty Mouse and the Apple Keyboard. They&#8217;re also a pleasure to use. Once you&#8217;re familiar with the single button of the Apple Mighty Mouse, it&#8217;s easy to operate and fits snugly into the palm of the hand. The Apple Keyboard may surprise you with its compact, sleek looks; its low front edge, however, means there&#8217;s no need for a wrist support. The ergonomic design and soft keys help keep the user&#8217;s hands in a natural, relaxed position.</p>
<p>This is fine, of course, but the other initial point of interest for a new computer is the quality of the screen images. The iMac has two screen sizes, a 20 inch and a 24inch. Both are widescreen TFT active-matrix liquid crystal displays with glass fronts. The resolution of the 20 inch screen is 1680 by 1050 pixels, and that of the 24 inch screen 1920 by 1200 pixels.</p>
<p>For the user, the screens are remarkably clear with dynamic glossy colours and satisfyingly sharp detail. The glossy finish can prove a problem in some lighting conditions so you do need to account for this when you locate the screen. But this is a minor quibble for screens that burst with life and offer viewing angles of 1600 on the 20 inch model, and 1780 on the 24 inch version.</p>
<p>Technical spec</p>
<p>The technical specifications of the iMac prove this machine is good value for money. The processors are all Intel Core 2 Duo with options of 2.4GHz and 2.66GHz for the 20 inch model, and 2.8GHz and 3.06GHz for the 24 inch. With such powerhouses, you can expect to engage in fast, slick computing. Apple has gone a step further, however, and increased frontside bus speed from the 800MHz that appeared in former versions of the iMac to 1,066MHz. This improves the link between the processor and the computer memory. The result is an even quicker operating speed.</p>
<p>Standard memory for the 2.4GHz is 1GB (installed as a 1GB SO-DIMM), and for the other processors, 2GB (installed as two 1GB SO-DIMMs). You can buy more RAM and add it to the iMac via the Memory Access slot to a maximum of 4GB. If you do this, there&#8217;s no need to replace the original SO-DIMM.</p>
<p>Basic hard drive storage is a useful 250GB for the 2.4GHz iMac with an option for 320GB or 500GB. These options are particularly attractive if you intend to keep a lot of music, pictures and videos on your machine. The other models come with 320GB and a chance to boost this to 500GB or 750GB. The 24 inch iMac also offers 1TB of storage as its top of the range option &#8211; surely enough for most purposes.</p>
<p>On the 20 inch screen with 2.4GHz, graphics come via an ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT processor with 128MB of GDDR3 memory. This increases to an ATI Radeon HD 2600 PRO graphics processor with 256MB of GDDR3 memory for the 2.66GHz version. Gaming enthusiasts will doubtless opt for the latter, although the most serious among them will consider the 24 inch iMac. This is not just because of the enhanced screen size: Apple gives them the chance to have the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GS graphics processor with 512MB of GDDR3 memory. The NVIDIA gives you superb quality from the most challenging 3D games available, and with such a graphics card behind it, gaming fans cannot ignore what the iMac offers them.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>Connections</p>
<p>The iMac now has three USB 2.0 ports at the back and two on the Apple Keyboard. The keyboard ports are particularly convenient for the quick and easy attachment of devices. One extra feature worth noting is that you can now charge your iPod from one of the USB ports, even when the iMac is in Sleep mode.</p>
<p>All models also have one FireWire 400 port and one FireWire 800 port (rated at 7 watts each). This is a distinct improvement on previous iMac versions where only the 24 inch model had the 800 port.</p>
<p>Communications<br />
Each iMac has wireless capability. This is in the form of AirPort Extreme Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.1+EDR. There is also an Ethernet connection.</p>
<p>Audio<br />
The built-in stereo speakers with their internal 24 watt digital amplifier give excellent sound quality. Once they hear these, most users won&#8217;t need to attach external speakers.</p>
<p>Other audio features include headphone/optical digital audio output and audio line in/optical digital audio input minijacks.</p>
<p>Other <br />
A Mini-DVI output port gives you the option of DVI, VGA, S-video and composite video connections. You may need a suitable adaptor for some of these, however.</p>
<p>Software</p>
<p>The operating system is the Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard. The computer press has almost universally compared this favourably to Windows and it&#8217;s easy to see why. A PC user may certainly struggle at first to adapt to Mac OS X, but once this hurdle is past, the system is fast and simple. And thanks to Apple&#8217;s determination to provide a useful, state-of-the-art machine, you can now run Windows alongside Mac OS X Leopard and install Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>The pre-installed software of the iMac includes a wide range of updated Apple applications, together with iLife &#8217;08. Briefly, the iMac software enables you to perform all the basic functions you&#8217;d expect such as emailing and Internet surfing, plus extras such as creating and editing websites, photos and films. You can also use iChat to set up four-way video conferencing.</p>
<p>Depending on your needs, however, you may want to add iWork to the software spec. iWork allows you to manage all Microsoft office systems that cover word processing, spreadsheets and presentations.</p>
<p>But whatever the software, it originates with Apple. This means that the same principles apply to each screen. Once you grasp the drag-and-drop approach, everything becomes simple &#8211; and fun &#8211; to use.</p>
<p>Performance</p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprisingly difficult to compare the iMac to its competitors because Apple offers three distinct differences: </p>
<p>Style<br />
the Mac OS X operating system<br />
its own software</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, it is possible to compare the more objective items of power, memory, storage and graphics. In these respects, the iMac is not only great value, Apple have put the computer together very cleverly. By giving a lot of thought to the interaction of the iMac&#8217;s component parts, Apple has maximised speed and efficiency. You rarely see this on comparably priced PCs with the possible exception of Sony&#8217;s VAIO range. </p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The iMac is an eye-catching and desirable piece of equipment for anyone interested in style, but the level of specification also makes it a practical, cost-effective and exciting computer for the home and office.</p>
<p>Pros  </p>
<p>
The iMac looks great, is compact and runs almost silently<br />
The Apple Keyboard and Apple Mighty Mouse are comfortable to use over long periods<br />
The operating system is straightforward and fast<br />
The built-in wireless features are a convenient bonus<br />
The ability to run Windows and Microsoft Office means that the iMac is a tremendous all-rounder for the home or office<br />
The levels of technical specification of each model are tremendous value and almost unbeatable by any comparably priced PC<br />
At the top of the range, iMac offers gaming enthusiasts a first-class experience</p>
<p>
Cons</p>
<p>The glossy screen is difficult to view under some lighting conditions</p>

<div class="PostContent">
<p>A new generation of Apple notebooks has arrived. This time, however, the &#8220;new generation&#8221; tag doesn&#8217;t just refer to upgrades &#8211; it heralds outstanding changes to design and technology. </p>
<p>Design</p>
<p>To construct the casing for a standard laptop, you need a lot of different parts. In the process, you increase the weight, the size, and the potential for problems. To address these points, Apple set itself the challenge of building the casing from just one part.</p>
<p>This goal may have appeared far-fetched at first, but Apple was convinced the effort was worth the trouble. The result is the new MacBook&#8217;s unibody, a casing created from just one piece of solid aluminium.</p>
<p>The unibody has transformed the look of the MacBook. More than ever, it gives the impression of a sophisticated and brilliantly engineered laptop. The unibody also feels incredibly robust. Furthermore, the use of aluminium helps the new MacBook weigh in at 0.23 kg (0.5 pounds) less than the previous model, and shave 0.34 cm (0.13 inches) from its height. </p>
<p>Different manufacturing techniques</p>
<p>Moulding such a casing, as you would with plastic, is a thing of the past. Instead, Apple makes the unibody by milling it with computer numerical control (CNC) machines. </p>
<p>These machines are some of the most accurate manufacturing tools on the planet. Apple has grasped their potential and employed them to the fullest extent. The sleep indicator light on the new MacBook, for example, appears to shine from behind the aluminium. Apple has achieved this by thinning the metal and drilling tiny holes through it.             </p>
<p>Environmental standards</p>
<p>The new MacBook will last for years, but it&#8217;s good to know the aluminium unibody is recyclable. This reflects the seriousness with which Apple views its environmental responsibility. The company has applied stringent standards to every aspect of the new MacBook, insisting that manufacturing techniques go hand in hand with the most demanding eco principles.</p>
<p>Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are absent from all the internal components of the new MacBook; none of the internal cables have PVC; the glass of the screen doesn&#8217;t contain any arsenic; and the display behind it is mercury-free. The new MacBook is setting a benchmark for the complete removal of toxins from computers.</p>
<p>In terms of energy efficiency, the new MacBook has a double victory to celebrate. Not only does it meet Energy Star requirements as previously, it has also acquired an EPEAT gold rating. EPEAT is the foremost environmental evaluation system for desktops, laptops, and monitors. To obtain a gold rating is a significant achievement.</p>
<p>Other features</p>
<p>Further outstanding features of the new MacBook are the trackpad, the screen, and the Mini DisplayPort. The trackpad immediately catches the eye because it&#8217;s almost 40% larger than before. When you start to use it, you also appreciate its extra functions. The trackpad now has full Multi-Touch capability that includes pinching to zoom in and out; three and four finger swiping; creating a right click area for shortcuts; and using any part of the trackpad&#8217;s surface as a button.</p>
<p>The new MacBook&#8217;s screen has changed to a thinner LED backlit display that provides full brightness the moment the MacBook comes on. A frameless glass front complements this and makes the widescreen appear larger than its 13.3 inches.</p>
<p>A Mini DisplayPort replaces the Mini DVI and FireWire 400 ports. The Mini DisplayPort provides an easy, plug-and-play connection for an Apple LED Cinema Display, and can show images on both the MacBook and the Cinema Display at the same time. Mini DisplayPort adaptors for VGA, DVI and dual-link DVI connections are available should you need them.</p>
<p>The 2.4GHz MacBook also has another bonus. It now boasts the illuminated keyboard so admired on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. </p>
<p>Technology</p>
<p>The new aluminium MacBook is available in two models, the 2.0GHz and the 2.4GHz. Both processors use Intel Core 2 Duo technology with 3MB on-chip shared L2 cache.</p>
<p>The standard models of the previous generation were 2.1GHz and 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duos with the same L2 cache. Both new versions, however, have a 1066MHz system bus, compared to 800MHz. In addition, 2GB of memory is now a standard feature (with the capacity to accept 4GB if you prefer). The hard drives are 160GB Serial ATA at 5,400 rpm for the 2.0GHz, and 250GB for the 2.4GHz. You can increase storage to 320GB or 350GB, and there&#8217;s an option of a 128GB solid-state drive.</p>
<p>As for the optical drive, the new MacBooks no longer offer a Combo. Apple has passed this over in favour of the superior 8x slot-loading SuperDrive on both models.</p>
<p>Graphics</p>
<p>The features and technology of the new MacBook all deserve your attention, but one in particular is creating both interest and excitement.</p>
<p>The old MacBook had an Intel GMA X3100 graphics processor with 144MB of DDR2 SDRAM shared with the main memory. The new MacBook has an integrated processor that provides up to five times better performance. This graphics powerhouse, the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M, is the result of development work between Apple and NVIDIA. It has 256MB of DDR3 SDRAM, and contains 16 parallel processing cores. The result is 3D images that are fast, responsive, and more detailed. The MacBook is now a highly desirable laptop for game players.</p>
<p>Battery</p>
<p>With all these extras to cope with, particularly the graphics processor, you might expect the MacBook&#8217;s battery to suffer. On the contrary: the official life of the battery has increased from four and a half to five hours.</p>
<p>Apple has accomplished this by keeping the principle of energy efficiency to the forefront of its thinking. From the MacBook&#8217;s screen to the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M processor, the design has incorporated the lowest energy use possible.</p>
<p>Innovation</p>
<p>The developments the MacBook represents are profound. This is a laptop that introduces impressive design, manufacturing, performance, and environmental innovations. It also throws down a gauntlet for other companies to pick up if they choose. In the meantime, the MacBook remains exceptional.</p>
