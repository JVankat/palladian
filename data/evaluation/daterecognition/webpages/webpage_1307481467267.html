Francesca Vecchio was almost bound to if not end in total disaster, then
certainly in Ray either exploding and hitting something (or someone)

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

of Ray. His heart sank. One look confirmed that the conversation was
going along fairly predictable lines. Ray was looking defensive and was
(rather unusually) sitting down. It seemed he had decided to go for the
'sullen but seething' approach while apparently arguing some point with
Stella. <br style='mso-special-character: line-break'>

Fraser recognized as frequently being present when he was having some
success in baiting Ray, and Francesca was talking about something or
other which Fraser assumed to be exacerbating the situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:

been aware of the potential meltdown from his office and had stood up
to sort it out, sit himself down again at Fraser's approach. Obviously
trusting him to prevent it from getting too heated. He sighed to himself,
supposing it was probably too much to ever expect Ray to learn to stop
reacting to aggravation in such a physical and explosive manner. If he
ever did learn to just walk away, Fraser's would be the first life to
get easier. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'> <![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br

now you're telling me you've learned to swim. Get real,&quot; came Stella's
voice, which was managing to convey absolute disbelief, irritation and
disdain all at once. Ray seemed to shrink further back in to his seat
but Fraser was relieved and somewhat impressed to see he hadn't given
up in the face of his ex-wife just yet; his next words equaled hers in
both bitterness and tone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gala is for people in this precinct which last time I checked you were
not so why don't you just go and release a mass murderer or something
and butt out. Maybe I just didn't want to swim with you. Ever think of

but somewhat misguided attempt to be supportive. Fraser cringed at her
next words and hoped that Francesca's pop psychology phase would end
soon or at least before serious damage was done. For someone trying to
be helpful, her words could not have been more ill chosen. <br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

are often developed by traumatic events in childhood and which can seriously
inhibit peoples lives. I know of a very good self help group which helps
me with my fear of cheap skin care products. We all support and help
each other by talking about and exploring our deepest fears, sometimes
ending up with a good cry at the end&quot;. <br>
<br>
She confirmed this by attempting to hold his hand. At this he did stand
up, pushing his chair back with characteristic force. He shoved Francesca's
hand away, glaring at Stella as he did so. He almost spat out the words,<br

for both himself and Stella. He seemed surprised to see his parents there

wore the T-shirt and swim trunks Fraser had given him which seemed to
have the effect of making him seem even thinner than usual. Fraser anticipated
Ray would suffer his mother's overenthusiastic attempts to feed him in
the course of the next few weeks. The thought of this didn't entirely
displease Fraser since he had on previous occasions benefited from piles
of food dumped at the consulate by Ray when Mrs Kowalski had decided

far more success in quieting him than we did. He was so good in fact

considering the program. The residential program was aimed at seven to
twelve-year-old deprived children. These children had no other access
to rural experiences and their parents could not afford the luxury of
private summer camps. Photographs showed a functional building by a lake.
Not beautiful but a change from the city. The center apparently catered
to thirty children and there were seven full time staff. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

The thought sent a shudder up Fraser's spine. A page was dedicated to
the staff and counselors. Jeffery Righton appeared to be one of their
more esteemed team members. His photograph showed a good looking man
in his late forties or early fifties, looking fit and healthy. He smiled
into the camera looking like the favorite uncle who everyone loves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

financing seemed fairly standard; similar to hundreds of other identical

his car keys down and took off his jacket. He glared at Fraser and stalked
in to the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. Fraser heard the sounds
of fierce tooth brushing. Fraser observed that Ray could make even brushing
his teeth a reflection of his mood. Still not saying a word he then fetched
the blanket from his room and threw it at Fraser. Before he had a chance
to take it off his head the bedroom door had slammed and Ray had disappeared
into his bedroom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

there. Flicking through he swallowed down his nausea at some of the pictures.
It seemed Righton had been escalating in the perversity of his tastes
since he was younger. James Ross featured prominently, a fact that would
be helpful in his defense. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
