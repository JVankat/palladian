<h3>Economic Overview &#8211; Manitoba</h3>
<p>Economically, Manitoba may be excited about saying farewell to 2010. Indeed, this was a challenging year, particularly within the province&#8217;s goods-producing sectors. The agricultural season was beset by bad weather, and many Manitoba farmers struggled. The construction industry faced similar challenges. Weather delayed or prevented a number of projects, and reduced private-sector investment affected the bottom line for many construction companies. Manufacturing employment increased in the first three quarters of 2010; however, this represents only a partial recovery from the pre-2008 employment numbers.</p>
<p>These setbacks can be seen in Manitoba&#8217;s bottom line. According to a recent Conference Board of Canada forecast, Manitoba&#8217;s real gross domestic product will post a gain of just 0.7% this year.</p>
<p>And yet, there is reason for optimism. Agriculture is bound to recover in 2011, and mining, manufacturing and construction are poised for a big year due in part to expansion projects. Buoyed by growth in the goods-producing sector and the promise of a stronger showing in the services-producing sector, GDP should increase by 2.3% in 2011, according to the same Conference Board of Canada forecast.</p>
<p>Manitoba employment dropped in November both in goods-producing and in services-producing sectors. The loss affected full-time and part-time jobs alike. However, the province&#8217;s long-term employment trend remains positive. There were close to 13,000 more Manitobans working in November 2010 than there were in November 2009. Further, Manitoba's unemployment rate last month (5.1%) remains the lowest in Canada.</p>
<p>Finance, insurance, real estate and leasing; health care and social assistance; and manufacturing were among the fastest growing sectors in November in Manitoba. Professional, scientific and technical services; educational services; and accommodation and food services did not fare as well.</p>

<h3>Events and Trends in Manitoba</h3>
<p><strong>Manitoba oil industry booming</strong>: Oil production is at record levels, and the number of wells drilled in 2010 (452 to date) is double the number drilled last year, and close to the record of 476 wells in 2006. Expectations are for about 550 new wells in 2011. Total expenditures in the industry in Manitoba for 2010 are about $800 million.</p>

<p><strong>Manitoba school age raised to 18</strong>: The Province of Manitoba is tabling new school dropout rules that will require all young Manitobans to stay in school until they reach the age of 18. This will provide young people with the opportunity to continue their education at the post-secondary level and in turn have more career success.</p>
<p class="alignRight smallFont"><em>Key Source: Province of Manitoba, November 18, 2010</em></p>
<p><strong>Manitoba expands role of nurse practitioners</strong>: As part of its mandate that all Manitobans will have a family doctor by 2015, the Province of Manitoba proposes the opening of five pilot medical clinics next year. The clinics will be open for extended hours in high-traffic locations, such as shopping malls, and will be staffed by nurse practitioners. Allowing nurse practitioners to diagnose, prescribe medication, order and manage tests, and perform routine procedures will leave more time for doctors to deal with health issues that are more complex. If the pilot is a success, the number of clinics will be expanded. Mobile units could be provided for remote communities.</p>

<p class="alignRight smallFont"><em>Key Source:&#160;Winnipeg Free Press, November 30, 2010</em></p>
<p><strong>Homes more affordable</strong>: Lower mortgage rates and price declines in some areas have resulted in a drop in Manitoba&#8217;s housing affordability index for all three main housing types: bungalows, two-storeys, and condominiums. Manitoba is one of two provinces to drop below the long-term average for all three types. A decline in the index typically results in more affordable housing.</p>

<h4 class="lightgreyBG">Winnipeg</h4>
<p><strong>New Flyer lays off 34 employees:</strong> New Flyer Industries, a Winnipeg-based bus-manufacturing company, issued lay off notices to 34 employees on December 6. New Flyer reported a 15.9% decline in revenue in its third quarter results released in November. Demand is not expected to recover until at least 2012, as many US states are cutting services and deferring procurement of new equipment in an effort to balance their budgets. The company laid off 320 employees from its Winnipeg workforce in the summer of 2009, due to the deferral of a $122-million order.</p>

<p><strong>Agri-Food Central and Bison Transport work together</strong>: Agri-Food Central Ltd., a Winnipeg broker, announced the consolidation of its multi-modal operations at a single site at Bison Transport&#8217;s 235,000-square-foot warehouse located near the airport. The location will allow Agri-Food to access multiple railway carriers from across Canada and through the US and Mexico, along with docking facilities for moving goods from truck to rail and vice versa. Agri-Food currently ships specialty crops from across the prairies to Mexico and Latin America and is working on its business to bring goods back from the south. With the indoor cross-docking facilities, it will move cargo from Bison trucks directly onto its containers and ship them south. CentrePort Canada initiated discussion to bring Agri-Food Central and Bison Transport together, as part of its effort to develop trade flows between Canada and Mexico. CentrePort Canada is Manitoba's 20,000-acre inland port, and the first logistics hub in the country to offer investors single-window access to Foreign Trade Zone benefits.</p>

<p><strong>Louisianna Pacific implements curtailment</strong>: Louisianna Pacific (LP), located near Swan River, implemented a curtailment period that began November 8 and will go until December 8. The plant will then operate for eight days and shut down until January 6. During the curtailment period, about half of the workers will keep working. This curtailment strategy has been implemented at various times over the past few years, as a response to the decline in demand for lumber from the continued weak housing market in the US.</p>

<p><strong>Powerview-Pine Falls residents without work since Tembec closure last year</strong>: The Winnipeg River Community Adjustment Corporation (WRCAC) held a Career Fair in Pine Falls last week. The group includes representatives from different levels of government, and works to negate the effects of the Tembec paper mill closure. The Pine Falls paper mill has been idle since September 1, 2009, when Montreal-based Tembec locked out union employees during contract negotiations. Late last year, Trembec announced that it would close the facility and put it up for sale. Nearly 300 workers lost their jobs. Tembec said at the time that if a buyer could not be found soon, the plant would be mothballed. Many members of the Powerview-Pine Falls community have been without steady employment since the lock out.</p>

<p><strong>HudBay Minerals expansion project in Flin Flon</strong>: A $20-million mine expansion project is underway at HudBay Minerals' 777 Mine near Flin Flon. Blasting of the new entrance and underground ramp is now occurring on a 24-hour cycle. Early production for the zinc, copper, gold, and silver mine is expected to begin in mid-2012, and full production is expected to begin in 2013. The ramp development will require 22 employees. Once full production is reached in 2013, up to 44 employees could be required. The miners will come from the Trout Lake Mine that is to close in 2012 and the existing section of the 777 Mine.</p>

<p><strong>Vale to invest $1 billion to develop new nickel sources in Thompson</strong>: Vale&#8217;s plan to invest more than $1 billion to develop new sources of nickel ore at its Thompson 1-D and Pipe-Kipper deposits in Manitoba is part of a broader $10-billion investment plan in Canada. The Thompson D mine expansion, currently at the pre-feasibility stage, could produce 33 million pounds annually, while the output at a longer-term project called Pipe-Kipper has yet to be determined. Vale expects to mine 75 million pounds of nickel in Thompson in 2011, compared with 198 million pounds mined at its operations in Sudbury. The $10 billion US Vale plans to spend expanding its operations in Canada includes $3.4 billion in Ontario, $3 billion in Saskatchewan, and $2.8 billion in Newfoundland and Labrador. Vale recently received a $1-billion loan from Export Development Canada, which includes about $500 million to help the company develop its operations in Canada. The loan is tied to another $500 million for Vale's operations outside Canada if the company uses Canadian goods and services, or for Vale exports if it uses Canadian suppliers.</p>

<p><strong>Proposed shutdown of Thompson smelter and refinery could leave 500 out of work</strong>: Brazilian mining company Vale announced on November 17 that it plans to phase out its smelting and refining operations in Manitoba by 2015. The proposed shutdown of the Thompson smelter and refinery would result in a loss of about 500 jobs or 40% of the current Vale Thompson workforce. The estimated loss to the payroll in Thompson for some of the city's highest paid jobs could be as much as $50 million annually, money which would no longer be circulating in the local economy.</p>
<p class="alignRight smallFont"><em>Key Source: Thompson Citizen, November 17 and 26, 2010</em></p>
<p><strong>Smelter in Thompson to close</strong>: Vale has identified a number of issues that led to operating changes at its smelter in Thompson. Mineral reserves in Thompson have not been sufficient to operate the smelter and refinery at full capacity for some time. To compensate for this shortfall, Vale has been importing as much as 45% of the nickel processed in Thompson from Voisey's Bay, Newfoundland. This external source will no longer be available after 2013. Changes to federal SO2 emission standards are also a factor. Starting in 2015, Vale will be required to reduce airborne emissions at the Thompson operation by approximately 88%, a target Vale has concluded that it cannot meet. Construction of a new state-of-the-art, $2.8-billion smelting and refining processing facility, located on tidewater, is underway at Long Harbour, Newfoundland, and is scheduled to be complete in 2013. It will process the concentrate from nickel sulphate directly into finished nickel product.</p>
