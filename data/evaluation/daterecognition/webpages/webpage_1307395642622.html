You like to push ahead in life and push hard, brushing aside obstacles or tackling them with enthusiasm. Not for you the quiet life; you like, indeed you thrive on, action, and there is only one course of action for you - get on with it! I could perhaps sum it up like this. A building needs to be demolished. Now some people would make plans, go through all the formalities, consider taking out the windows, then the tiles, and so on. You are more likely to call in the bulldozer and knock it down. Why waste time? You see the goal, know what needs to be done and get on with it. Of course, your ways of doing things are not likely to find favour amongst your superiors, but you probably couldn't care less anyway. Bureaucracy, red tape, rules and regulations are all very well - unless they get in the way, that is.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You like to be active and probably find it difficult to rest or even stay still for any length of time. The Sign bestows energy - lots of energy which needs an outlet. So, you like to be involved with energetic pursuits, usually with some element of risk or even danger. Adventure, sports, travel. It's the challenge you enjoy. It burns up the energy, stimulates you, and you relish the sense of freedom and achievement. Your enthusiasm is almost boundless and you put a great deal of effort into whatever you do. With so much energy, nothing is too much trouble, and you will persist almost to the point of exhaustion once you are on course.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Courage in the face of difficulties comes naturally and you may actually seek out risky activities or goals just to express this. Each challenge you overcome bolsters up your confidence and, because feeling confident is very important to you, the two go together. Your resolve and determination is absolute. Faced with problems and difficulties you will not back down unless absolutely necessary. Even then, you are quite likely to take on the same problem again just to prove you can win. Retreat - perhaps; give in - never!&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Being strong willed and quick thinking makes you a good leader - you would rather lead than follow. You can inspire others into action and motivate them. You like to lead from the front with the assumption, 'If I can do it, so can you'. People just seem to get pulled along in your wake such is your enthusiasm and dogged determination to succeed.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        There is something of the pioneering spirit in you as well. You show initiative, like to start new projects and involve others. You are naturally ambitious and need new goals because you are never content to rest on your laurels, so to speak. There is always something out there to conquer, some goal to achieve, something worth battling for. Life is a series of exciting adventures.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Your ruling planet - Mars - has difficult aspects which modify the way in which you express yourself. Chances are that your energies are out of balance, in other words they are controlling you rather than the other way around. Your assertiveness can be too abrupt, even aggressive at times and others may find this off-putting. You push yourself and others too hard, you expect too much, and you don't necessarily play fair. Conflict is never far away and you are likely to make enemies. Anger comes easily and you are quite likely to lose your temper if things don't happen immediately or you can't get your own way. You are also inclined not to listen to the opinions of others and you force your ideas onto them instead. Arguments are bound to happen, and you may actually enjoy the confrontation because it gives you the opportunity to fight and win. But do you really win?&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You have to be careful of impulsiveness as this can lead to repercussions or even accidents. The goals you set out to achieve are dogged by problems. You may push too hard, not being aware of important details or the opinions of those along the way. You tend to fight your way through life. Then again, you may set goals aside in the rush to tackle something else - you scatter your energies too thinly. By slowing down and moderating your
        actions you could achieve twice as much with half the effort.&nbsp;<br>

To own things of value and to have money and the security it can bring is where your interests lie, and you ought to do well in life.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You have the gift of being practical and down to earth. The Earth and all its material abundance is something you instinctively understand and enjoy interacting with. You have a natural sense of value. You can look at something and know its real worth; you understand these things. Naturally, you wish to own things of value and have the money to buy them, consequently it is in the sphere of moneymaking that you ought to do best. It's your ruling planet Venus that attracts you to the material side of life - and it attracts things into your life like a magnet. You see something and you simply have to have it. Venus does the rest.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        This involvement with the material side of life bestows the gift of practicality, common sense and a down to earth nature. Being naturally cautious, you don't like to be rushed into things. Instead, you like to think, plan, and organise before committing yourself to a course of action. You are restrained and your patience is considerable. You can see the danger in inappropriate or untimely action, and where others may rush in you take your time and as a result gain far more in the long run. The caution you exhibit isn't fear, its a knowing, a feel for practicality that others don't have. You are deliberate and highly focused, quite prepared to wait until the time is right however long it may take. Once on course you are resolute, showing a great determination to succeed regardless of how long it might take or what the obstacles are. It doesn't matter how long it takes - I will have it!&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You have the capacity for hard work, you keep going when the rest give up, happily plodding along as if you enjoyed it - which you do. Endurance is the name of the game, and you have lots of it. You can keep going despite the obstacles, you simply will not give up or be blown off course. Unswerving, rock-solid, immovable. Some people would say you were stubborn - perhaps you are, but it's a positive stubbornness that gets results, and results are what it's all about.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You come across as reliable and trustworthy. People know they can depend on you, especially with the practicalities of life. You make a good friend and can be very loyal and supportive. Your outward quiet and restrained nature belies the fact that deep down you are actually quite affectionate and have strong feelings but, not being an exhibitionist, you tend to keep this away from public view. In any case, you feel that one of the best ways to show your affections is to provide material comforts for your loved ones. This sometimes gets in the way. There is an old astrological saying: 'Lucky in life, unlucky in love'. Perhaps this isn't quite accurate or may be an oversimplification, nevertheless the material side of life can act as a substitute for heartfelt affection, or it may be that your restrained nature prevents full unbridled expression. Gifts are fine, but giving of yourself may not be that easy in the truest sense of the word.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Being gifted with the blessings of Venus, you ought to have a cultured attitude. You like the good things in life, you appreciate beauty and value. Artistic matters may also be part of your life. Quite often the Taurus subject has a good singing voice or can act.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">Your ruling planet - Venus - has difficult aspects which modify the way in which you express yourself. Life can seem dull, in a rut, and you may be a slave to routine, being too cautious to change things in case you lose out. In short, you overvalue the practical side of life and in so doing constrain yourself to a boring treadmill. There is never enough no matter how much you earn or possess. What you do have causes problems because your are over possessive and inflexible. Your possessions don't give you the pleasure they ought to because you are overly attached to them. You need so much yet you feel denied.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        The one thing you need to understand - and do understand, deep down - is the law of supply and demand. In other words - what you send out you get back, what you desire you acquire. The desire to acquire is out of balance and needs readjustment. Your nature has become too inflexible, too wrapped up in the material side of life probably because, deep down, you are insecure and assume that your life can be wholly satisfied by material things - it can't. You need to change, you know this but being naturally stubborn and fixed in your ways it just seems like an uphill struggle. But, you do have tremendous staying power and once you have made your mind up you can do anything. Life is infinitely more flexible than you know and has a great deal to offer you. All it takes is to realise that by changing your thoughts life can be much, much better.&nbsp;

You like to think, speak, write, travel and generally be on the move, changing from one subject or location to the next with consummate ease. You can be very lively. Never a dull moment - unless you get bored, that is. Boredom is the worst thing that can happen to you. Your body language compliments what you are saying, using gestures to emphasise a word or phrase.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        The one thing you are is adaptable. You just love change and ever-changing situations. 'Variety is the spice of life' someone once wrote. No, for you variety is an absolute MUST, without it life would be so dull. You do need lots of stimulus and constant interests. Resting, or even staying still , is not easy - there's too much to do! Your versatility is almost legendary. I think it's a safe bet that you can do two things at the same time - or more. Watching the TV while having a telephone conversation is just one example. You can turn your hand to anything and you learn so quickly.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Being an intelligent soul you are noted for being clever and informed. Learning, in fact any kind of education, really appeals. All that knowledge - you simply have to know. You absorb information like a sponge and once your enthusiasm is fired up you learn so quickly. Some folk may accuse you of being a, 'a mine of useless information'. But, what would they know - it's all useful information, and to you it is food for the mind. You like to communicate through speaking, writing, and telephone calls. Getting about and
        traveling also appeals, you just like the thrill of movement and ever-changing scenarios.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You have the gift of humour. Laughter comes naturally and you can see the funny side of any situation, especially if it involves someone else getting into trouble. Never stuck for a witty comment, you can liven up the most austere situation with some clever quip. It isn't that you have to think about these things, they just come naturally, off the top of your head, so to speak. Sometimes you surprise even yourself by what comes out of your mouth so spontaneously. You are good fun to be around.&nbsp;</font></p>

Your nervousness gets in the way of easy self expression and you lack confidence which, in turn, affects your communication skills. Sometimes you will find that it isn't easy to make yourself understood or to express your opinions adequately. You just 'lock up' and feel inhibited. At other times you will chatter endlessly, repeating the same point in many different ways as if afraid people will not understand you. More likely, you are afraid of silence, it feels uncomfortable. Misunderstandings are so easy. You mean to say one thing but somehow it comes out all wrong. Your opinions change rapidly, especially to win an argument.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Learning is not easy. There may have been problems in your early education which was affected or even halted in some way by events beyond your control. The problem now is that you try to take on board too many ideas, as if you are afraid you might miss something. You may start to read a book and never finish it, learn a new skill yet never complete the course. Your restless, nervous nature seems to want to move on to other things. Rather than learn and be original you are inclined to imitate or borrow from others.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You tend to be diffuse with too many things on the go at the same time, so continuity becomes a problem as indeed does completing tasks. Your nature is to be nervous, excitable and restless. You have difficulty in staying still or resting and you are prone to nervous exhaustion as a result. It is important to realise that all the talents and abilities previously mentioned are yours for the asking. Once you learn to slow down, taking one thing at a time and also learning the art of relaxation, you will find a new lease of life. Remember, the mind a great servant but a bad master. The mind is something you are well equipped to deal with.&nbsp;</font></p>

Up go the defences and you fight back, much to the surprise of the 'enemy'. You also seek to protect those you care about, just as a mother would do for a child.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        You nature is aptly summed up in the crab. Surrounded by a hard shell to protect a delicate interior. Moves unpredictably sideways to fool its opponents yet if cornered makes a formidable opponent. Aren't you similar? Don't you sometimes give that appearance of being hard or tough when you know deep down you are not? Its all part of your natural defences. Rather than take on a situation or person head on don't you side-step or change direction to avoid exposing your vulnerability? However, if you are in a corner don't you fight back and hold your ground tenaciously? You don't seek conflict but if you have to defend yourself you will and you won't give up easily either.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        I mentioned emotions. You are an emotional person and very sensitive. The logic of a situation doesn't matter. What does matter is what you feel deep down, and these feelings - your intuition and instincts - are your guiding light. Quite often you will be proved right when so-called logic suggests the opposite. You care deeply, have great compassion and sympathy and are not afraid to back this up with action, although it has to be said that you prefer to help in hidden and indirect ways if possible. You like to support people but you don't really want any publicity, unless it is necessary to accomplish your goal, that is.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Your imagination is one of your strongest assets. You tend to think in pictures, in fact it's probably fair to say that you see things in your mind almost as clearly as you do in real life. Your memory is also very good and you are often able to recall facts from long ago in great detail - and the emotions of the time as well! The reason for this is complex but part of the picture lies in the fact that you are sentimental and like to collect things of relevance. I bet you collect around you all sorts of articles that remind you of some favourite time from the past. It is exactly the same with your memory - you collect images.&nbsp;<br>

        Cancer is the Sign ruling the home and domestic affairs. Your home and family are very important to you, they are the bedrock, the foundation on which you build your life. You immerse yourself in your home, you feel safe and secure there, it is your castle, your defence against the hurts of the world. Your need to feel protected is the underlying reason for this.&nbsp;</font></p>

The main problem lies in your emotions which are not under your control, so you become the victim of circumstances through your reactions. Your moods are apt to change too easily because you instinctively react to the slightest change or imagined threat. You are touchy and inclined to be defensive, putting up barriers when there is no need. Just as likely is the opposite effect of being timid and allowing yourself to be pushed around or used. You can be given to periods of deep gloomy moods in which you brood over things perhaps indulging in self pity. Your imagination gets out of control, you see the worst in situations and worry needlessly. Often you will get lost in daydreaming and this can make you careless or forgetful. Your need for security turns into clinging, as if you are afraid to let go of something in case your life should be seriously compromised. Clinging to people, in the form of clannishness, is not uncommon as well. You need to realise that only by letting go of the old and outmoded can something better move into your life.&nbsp;</font></p>

Like your ruling planet, the Sun, you like to shine and be the centre of attraction, not for egotistical reasons but simply because that is were you feel you belong. You like responsibility or being in a position of authority and you really enjoy it if people appreciate what you do for them. As a Leo, you are quite happy to accept a small role helping out, but deep down you really want to be in charge showing what you can do. It is possible you have connections to the arts and theatre, or at least have an interest in such things. Again, it's the idea of being in the spotlight, doing something creatively that appeals. That sense of theatre gives you the ability to be entertaining. People enjoy your pleasant company. You are good fun to be with and can be very amusing.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The lion is a perfect image for you. He is the king of the beasts and knows it. He doesn't have to demonstrate his superiority, everyone else knows he is king - instinctively. His regal nature shines out and everyone else in the jungle simply accept the fact. He does like to rest in the Sun and enjoy life, doing only what is necessary but doing it well. Enjoying life is the name of the game. Life for you is mainly about pleasure - and why not? You like to enjoy life and all it has to offer. Life is for living - a fact most folk would do well to observe. You may find joy in creative pursuits, such a hobbies, where your natural urge to create and give form can be expressed. Holidays also offer a great chance to have fun and take in the sunshine.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        You are a highly dependable person and can be relied on. People know this, respond to it and instinctively trust you and your judgement. You tend to be loyal even when others act unreasonably. Your nature is to try to overlook people's faults, or accept that there are reasons for their behaviour and there is enough trouble in the world without you adding to it. You don't hold grudges either - what's the point? One more reason why people like and respect you. You come across as a dignified soul, above the cut and thrust of baser dealings. You also command respect in a natural way without having to enforce it. Personal dignity and integrity is far more valuable to you than being superior or winning an argument. You also have a kindly and generous disposition - open handed and open hearted, If you can bring some joy and happiness into the lives of others you will try to do this.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        You are broad minded and inclined to be quite tolerant of other people's opinions even when they don't agree with your own. Live and let live is your philosophy - why argue? In any case you know you are right!&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 150%; background-color: #CCFFFF; margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Your

One of the main difficulties you face is that you tend to overvalue your importance and sometimes come across all wrong. You want to be in charge but somehow you manage to upset people in the process because you push too hard and become overbearing. You like power, but it isn't in balance. You tend to be unaware of the needs of others in your determination to succeed and you are inclined to overlook details and make mistakes.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You can be conceited and a little snobbish because you have such a high opinion of yourself, some of which is perhaps justified, but not fully. You need to take on board the views of others even if it dents your pride. Doing this makes you more human, more vulnerable, more acceptable and would guarantee far better results in life and an easier ride all round. Be more tolerant, learn to suffer the inadequacies of other folk and they will love you for it. Try not to be
        patronising and aloof. You have a natural talent for being centre stage and like to be to be appreciated for your efforts, but you will succeed only if you allow people to put you on a pedestal rather than building one
        all by yourself.&nbsp;</font></p>

It is the practicalities of life that appeal, most and if you are going to be practical then you need order. Details are something to enjoy dealing with and you are quite at home making lists, adding up figures and attending to details that would bore most people to death. You also have an analytical mind with a good eye for detail - you ought to be very good at spotting mistakes or finding room for improvements.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You are a reliable person, someone who is considered trustworthy and can be allowed to work away with every confidence that you will work tirelessly giving your very best. You like to be of service and to be appreciated for the hard work and dedication you so readily give. There is something of the skilled worker or craftsman in you and you may possess genuine talent. Certainly, you can work  to - and, indeed, insist on - high standards and efficiency. You take pride in your work and make every effort to achieve perfection.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Modesty comes naturally. You are quite content to see a job well done and probably get embarrassed if someone sings your praises - you tend to play down your abilities. You prefer to work away in the background rather than be in the limelight. As long as you are convinced that you have done your very best and that others are pleased with your efforts that is enough for you. You probably carry this through into the way you dress, preferring to dress down so that you don't stand out too much yet still give the impression of efficiency and reliability. This also fits in with your cautious down to earth approach to life, little by little, one step at a time, never pushing yourself to the fore. You prefer tried and tested ways of doing things, don't like to be hurried, taking your time making decisions or taking action. You like to feel on safe ground.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Health and hygiene may play a significant role in your make up and you will go to great pains to keep everything clean and tidy, the moral being that a clean environment makes for a healthy life.&nbsp;</font></p>

The need for precision and order gets out of balance and becomes a burden rather than a pleasure. You are too much of a perfectionist, critical of others and fussy over the slightest details making life hard for yourself and for others whom you make uncomfortable. Work assumes too much importance and you may be a workaholic expecting too much of yourself and other people. It is so easy to run yourself into the ground and affect your health. You worry too much as well. You have to be careful of being used by others who are quite willing to let you do all the work they can't be bothered with so that they can lead their own selfish existence.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Health and hygiene also assume too much importance and you may spend a great deal of time constantly cleaning up as if every speck of dust threatened your existence. Chances are you have health fads or spend far too much time trying to maintain or improve your health. It's also possible that your health isn't good because you worry too much about it instead of letting nature keep the balance.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        People may find it difficult to get close to you because you are too remote and stand-offish. You criticise people far too readily and allow even the slightest fault to upset you. Live and let live just isn't easy because you expect, and demand, such high standards. You give the impression of being cold and uncaring. What you need to realise is that you have all the talents and abilities previously mentioned and that you can have a happy and rewarding life if only you would do one thing - let go. Loosen up and relax the boundaries just a little and you will soon see the difference. Why be a slave to routine or the ever-tiring monotony of constantly imposing perfection onto everything? Even a saint isn't perfect.&nbsp;</font></p>

You weigh up the pros and cons of situations seeking to make a balanced and fair judgement. You like the idea of compromise and are normally quite good at getting people to come to amicable solutions. Your ability for diplomacy and tact is good, also. Your sense of fair play and justice is strong. Being the peaceful type, you normally seek diplomatic and tactful solutions, but quite contrary to your normally genial nature you are quite prepared to fight and fight hard against injustice. It offends you.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        The harmony existing between people is something you value, and you enter a relationship - be this a close friendship or romantic involvement - with a genuine spirit of equality. This is a contract, an honourable agreement between two consenting people which is to be cherished, maintained and protected. You really like to share, not only in a material sense but also on deeper levels as well. Just being with someone is not enough, and although you may mix freely with people in a casual sense you need a much closer, intimate contact. This can only be achieved in a spirit of mutual co-operation, trust and sharing. You are very supportive and like to be involved in the lives of people fortunate to have you as a friend or partner. In romantic associations you are openly affectionate and demonstrate love with consummate ease. Your partner will enjoy not only this but also the many gifts and acts of kindness you take pleasure in giving.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You exhibit a great deal of natural charm, you don't have to work on it or put up a false front, it just comes naturally. Your manners are likely to be impeccable and your grasp of etiquette good; it appeals to your refined nature. You have a natural sense of grace and balance. It is quite possible that you are good at dancing or anything demanding poise and graceful movement. The arts, music, painting, literature, and culture in general will appeal to your better nature, and you may possess some abilities or even talent in these things. Your dress sense ought to be particularly good because you have a natural sense of good taste and colour co-ordination. However, you can just as easily be a bit of a dropout in the fashion stakes, wearing any old thing as if you couldn't care less. Yet, somehow, you even manage to carry this off with style.&nbsp;</font></p>

Relationships are likely to be a constant problem. Generally, you are unhappy being alone and this makes you lower your standards and so become involved with unsuitable partners. Then again, you are just as likely not to take relationships seriously and be flirtatious or frivolous with equally unsatisfactory results. The problem is that you are too easily attracted - vulnerable if only you realised it.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        The idea of peacefulness becomes 'peace at any price', so you are not likely to exert yourself, preferring an easy, lazy way through life. You could do so much better if you got fired up and motivated instead of being attracted to the easy life. In complete contrast the need to fight against injustice can become misdirected in that you are only interested in fighting for the sake of it. You may dress provocatively as if to say - 'Here I am, if you don't like me, tough!' Your need to relate has changed from being harmonious to an open invitation to take you on. The reverse may be true in that your appearance may become an obsession. Not a hair out of place, not a crease to be seen - immaculate and highly groomed. Trouble is you are never really happy or comfortable because you are constantly attending to this image you portray of the perfectly dressed individual whom you consider to be a role model for everyone to follow. You get really upset if something happens to dent this assumed perfection.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Making decisions isn't easy, in fact it's a source of great strain. Sometimes it's too much of an effort and could involve upsetting someone, so you end up trying to please both parties by doing nothing. At other times you tend to see both sides of the argument as being equally valid, so you can't make your mind up and choose which one is best.&nbsp;<br>

        <p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">There is something alluring and magnetic about your appearance. It is as if you are hiding something and inviting people to discover what it is. Perhaps you are. You dress not only to feel good but also to attract attention, emphasising your body and sensuality. Your appearance compliments the inner power that radiates from within.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        You are an intensely passionate person who puts a great deal of emotion and determination into everything you do. There are no half measures or gray areas, everything is black or white, positive or negative, for or against, good or bad. Being incredibly fixed in your opinions, once a decision is made - that's it! You are not easily persuaded otherwise.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Your insight is terrific. You can see right through people and know if they are telling the truth or not. Nothing escapes your intense gaze - you do look directly at people, don't you?  Every slight movement comes under scrutiny and its hidden truth revealed to your astute mind. And, the more that is revealed, the more power you feel you have over the person. It's all about power and control - isn't it?&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Most people are an open book - at least to you - but you don't give much away do you? As they say, 'you play your cards close to your chest.' It's not that you are afraid of revealing who you are, because you have great confidence in yourself. It is more of a case that knowledge is power, so why give that power to someone else? Being secretive - and you are - is all part of the game of life, a game you intend to win.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Your curiosity is legendary - if something captures your attention you just have to know all about it. You don't ever give up and are determined to get to the bottom of things - regardless of how long it takes or what it costs. Your intuition is good, perhaps better than the other Water Signs, Cancer or Pisces, because it is highly focused, not given to fanciful imaginings. When you feel these inner promptings and 'know' something to be true, you make good use of this knowledge. This need to 'know' leads you to question the meaning of life itself and you may find yourself having interests in the mystical or the occult.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Your emotions are the powerhouse that drive you, and they are not the soppy, sentimental kind either. They are very intense, highly focused and enduring. Passion is something you understand and use. You involve yourself fully with your chosen partner and give yourself completely. Again, it's that 'all or nothing' nature - you don't know any other way.&nbsp;</font></p>

      
        <p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 150%; background-color: #CCFFFF; margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">Your

You may prefer to indulge in emotional excess. From the heights of joy to the deepest moods they change, sometimes instantly. You are given to emotional explosions if you can't have your own way, the more dramatic you are the better you like it, because it gives you a sense of power.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Your relationship with people is highly charged. You like or dislike with equal intensity and can be jealous and resentful if you don't get your own way. You know how to hurt people. Being able to sense their vulnerable points helps you exploit their weaknesses. You don't trust people easily and tend to be suspicious of them or their motives. You have a need to dominate people as well as your surroundings and you have little respect for anyone who shows weakness.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        You are playing the power game with life but you may expect too much and give too little - although you would probably dispute this. The danger is that you may find yourself alone, or at war with yourself. All this emotional turmoil - most of which is self generated if you are honest - does no good. You have the advantages and positive traits previously described, they are there for the taking should you choose a more balanced path. By taking control - that is self control - you get the benefits life has to offer.&nbsp;<br>

The word 'jovial' is taken from the Roman god Jupiter. You live life to the full and try to enjoy every moment. Spreading joy is the name of the game, the more fun the better. Your sense of humour is wonderful and laughter, that is real rib-ticking laughter, is your cure for the ailments of your fellow man - not to mention copious quantities of food and wine. It's very hard to be miserable when you are in full flow. Your generosity is deep and wide. You like to help people, alleviate their problems and make this a better world. People know you as open handed and warm hearted, a good friend and a pleasure to be with. This is also the most fortunate Sign in the Zodiac. Blessed by the power of Jupiter you can expect to do very well out of life because you have a 'lucky' streak. You just seem to attract opportunities and wealth. Much of this has to do with that wonderful virtue of optimism which you have in abundance.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        You are a real freedom-seeker and quite adventurous. You love to get out and about especially to far away places, seeking out new experiences and adding to your considerable knowledge. In any case, if you can't travel in a physical sense then you will do it in your mind by reading books, watching videos, or just contacting people in far away places to keep up with distant affairs.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        With all this fun it would be easy to conclude that you were just an easygoing individual who took life at face value and wasn't overly concerned with anything other than getting on with life, but of course that would be quite wrong. Your mind is extensive, you thrive on knowledge and you like to learn. Not about everyday things, you understand, but more about the deeper issues in life. You are intellectual and philosophical, a deep thinker. Education in all its forms may appeal, either through further education or simply by self education, it doesn't really matter. Your judgement is sound and you may be considered wise by some people who value your opinions and admire your grasp of difficult subjects. You may have interests in the morals of society, religion of some kind, or even prophecy, the latter of which may include genuine gifts.&nbsp;</font></p>

Excess could be a real problem. You are very restless finding it difficult to settle down, having a real wanderlust, and unable to relax. You are always on the go but may not necessarily achieve much in the process. Too many 'irons in the fire, too much going on for you to concentrate your efforts or attention. Many are the jobs half finished - although your intentions were good at the time! You can be careless as well, not giving sufficient attention to detail. Opportunities seem to go begging or pass you by, mainly because they seem to get in the way of your drive to be free, or involve disciplined effort.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        You still have a thirst for knowledge but studies are too scattered with numerous interests causing distraction and a subsequent failure to complete the course. You may be inclined cover this up through exaggeration or even boasting about your achievements which are wonderful in your mind's eye but not necessarily based on fact.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        You tend to go to extremes, overindulging in whatever takes your fancy. You seem to need endless freedom and fun but you don't count the cost or even care what others may think. Being tactful isn't your thing either. Strange thing is that you indulge yourself yet are inclined to moralise at other people, having one law for you and a completely different one for them. Easy come - easy go sees you overspending and, incidentally, falling prey to those who like to bask in reflected glory or take advantage of what they see as an easy ride. Life has so much to offer if only you could change your approach and take control.&nbsp;</font></p>

You take your time getting to know people, as if testing the ground before committing yourself. You are cautious - aren't you?&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Like the two other Earth Signs, Taurus and Virgo, you have a slow, deliberate approach to life. Your aims, however, are more in the public arena or concerned with national or worldly matters. You see the greater picture and like the idea of being involved in something big.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        You are not content to muddle along as one of the herd, you have ambition and well defined goals or aims in life. You seek to achieve something worthwhile not only for yourself but for others. You are enterprising, keen to get on and, having the foresight to see the greater picture, like to instigate projects which are in some ways bold or adventurous. Yet you are not one to take risks. You like to think, plan, check your facts and then act. It doesn't matter how long it takes to see a plan come to fruition, you have almost endless patience and, in any case, you really believe in what you are doing and have every faith in yourself and those involved with you along the way.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The practicalities of life appeal to you. You have a businesslike approach to life displaying professionalism and a high standard of efficiency. You like the idea of trade, commerce, building up a business and running it. You take your work very seriously and are quite happy to take on responsibilities, in fact you feel it is your duty to do this. You work tirelessly, are very conscientious in what you do and highly focused on your objectives.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        You are a cautious, self disciplined person who doesn't like to be hurried or pushed. You realise that the best way forward is through planning and attention to detail. You are a highly principled and trustworthy individual who values honesty and straight dealing. Integrity is the name of the game, and you like to think you can sleep easily at night with a clear conscience. In everything you do you strive to be reliable and dependable, a pillar of strength and an inspiration to those who work with you. One could say you are the rock on which solid foundations are built and the giver of structure and form to any worthwhile project.&nbsp;</font></p>

Your greatest problem lies in rigidity of outlook. You are far too conventional, quite content to live within the strictures dictated by others over which you either feel you have no say in the matter or unable to break free because you are too afraid of the insecurity this could bring. Rules and regulations are dominant in your life, and you apply these not only to yourself but to others as well. You may expect much but give little.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        In a material sense you may tend to hoard, afraid to spend in case it compromises your future, or are impelled to keep earning and acquiring to maintain your status in life. There never seems to be enough. The root of the problem lies in insecurity and  fear of what the future might hold - it restrains you unnecessarily.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Your mind is inclined to be gloomy and pessimistic, tending to see the dark side of things. Wherever you look there seem to be  obstacles rather than challenges for you to overcome, but are they real or imagined? Your view of the world, and yourself, is far too narrow. What you need to realise is that rules are for guidance - they are not absolute - and that needless responsibility crushes the soul. Take time out to distance yourself and re-appraise.&nbsp;</font></p>

You like to push ahead in life and push hard, brushing aside obstacles or tackling them with enthusiasm. Not for you the quiet life; you like, indeed you thrive on, action, and there is only one course of action for you - get on with it! I could perhaps sum it up like this. A building needs to be demolished. Now some people would make plans, go through all the formalities, consider taking out the windows, then the tiles, and so on. You are more likely to call in the bulldozer and knock it down. Why waste time? You see the goal, know what needs to be done and get on with it. Of course, your ways of doing things are not likely to find favour amongst your superiors, but you probably couldn't care less anyway. Bureaucracy, red tape, rules and regulations are all very well - unless they get in the way, that is.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You like to be active and probably find it difficult to rest or even stay still for any length of time. The Sign bestows energy - lots of energy which needs an outlet. So, you like to be involved with energetic pursuits, usually with some element of risk or even danger. Adventure, sports, travel. It's the challenge you enjoy. It burns up the energy, stimulates you, and you relish the sense of freedom and achievement. Your enthusiasm is almost boundless and you put a great deal of effort into whatever you do. With so much energy, nothing is too much trouble, and you will persist almost to the point of exhaustion once you are on course.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Courage in the face of difficulties comes naturally and you may actually seek out risky activities or goals just to express this. Each challenge you overcome bolsters up your confidence and, because feeling confident is very important to you, the two go together. Your resolve and determination is absolute. Faced with problems and difficulties you will not back down unless absolutely necessary. Even then, you are quite likely to take on the same problem again just to prove you can win. Retreat - perhaps; give in - never!&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Being strong willed and quick thinking makes you a good leader - you would rather lead than follow. You can inspire others into action and motivate them. You like to lead from the front with the assumption, 'If I can do it, so can you'. People just seem to get pulled along in your wake such is your enthusiasm and dogged determination to succeed.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        There is something of the pioneering spirit in you as well. You show initiative, like to start new projects and involve others. You are naturally ambitious and need new goals because you are never content to rest on your laurels, so to speak. There is always something out there to conquer, some goal to achieve, something worth battling for. Life is a series of exciting adventures.</font></p>

Chances are that your energies are out of balance, in other words they are controlling you rather than the other way around. Your assertiveness can be too abrupt, even aggressive at times and others may find this off-putting. You push yourself and others too hard, you expect too much, and you don't necessarily play fair. Conflict is never far away and you are likely to make enemies. Anger comes easily and you are quite likely to lose your temper if things don't happen immediately or you can't get your own way. You are also inclined not to listen to the opinions of others and you force your ideas onto them instead. Arguments are bound to happen, and you may actually enjoy the confrontation because it gives you the opportunity to fight and win. But do you really win?&nbsp;<br>

        You have to be careful of impulsiveness as this can lead to repercussions or even accidents. The goals you set out to achieve are dogged by problems. You may push too hard, not being aware of important details or the opinions of those along the way. You tend to fight your way through life. Then again, you may set goals aside in the rush to tackle something else - you scatter your energies too thinly. By slowing down and moderating your behaviour you could achieve twice as much with half the effort.&nbsp;<br>

        will suggest someone who is sensitive and, to some degree, delicate. Perhaps the best way to grasp your basic nature is to look at the sea. Vast, almost endless, constantly changing, having great unexplored depths and mysteries. Sound familiar?&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Of the three Water Signs, yours is the most sensitive. You respond so easily to people and situations because you feel deeply and are easily moved. Any hint of sadness and you are moved to tears of sympathy. Any hint of happiness and you are overjoyed for the person. It doesn't end there, though. You have great compassion, deep understanding and profound love, but unlike the soppy sentimentalists who offer platitudes, you really knock yourself out trying to help alleviate the problem and share the burdens. You genuinely need to be of service seeking no reward for yourself, in fact you will often sacrifice your own happiness to help others less fortunate than yourself. You give totally and ask nothing.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        Your mind is highly impressionable and receptive. Your imagination is vivid and boundless. You are not a logical person, as such, but you do have the gift of intuition, that 'knowing' that something is about to happen before it does, or that feeling that someone isn't all they appear to be. Scientists may dismiss this, but you know better. Trust your instincts. Your interests are more likely to centre on religious, mystical or psychic matters, the latter of which you have a natural affinity and perhaps even genuine abilities. Most mediums have Pisces or its ruling planet Neptune prominent in their charts.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        With all this sensitivity, it isn't always easy coping with the cut and thrust of everyday life, so you seek seclusion and peace away from it all. Nature, and particularly the sea, are a great comfort to you and help you recharge your mental and spiritual batteries, so to speak.  Other diversions lie in the arts with which you also have great affinity. Music can move you deeply, dancing offers grace and movement which you 'flow' into. You can see beauty and deep meaning in sculpture and other works of art that others can't.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p style="word-spacing: 0; text-indent: 0; line-height: 150%; margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">One, or both, ruling planets has difficult aspects which modify the way in which you express yourself. Your problem is that you are too sensitive, which leaves you gullible and easily swayed. People take advantage of your better nature; you are seen as a soft touch. When you see someone taking advantage you would love to stand up to them and tell then were to go - but somehow you can't. Being an idealist, you try to see the best in them and make allowances, hoping things will work out for the best. You lack the practicality needed to get through life. You tend to get confused and in a muddle, so mistakes are made which could have been avoided. Extravagance needs to be curbed.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        You are prone to worry unduly; problems just go round and round in your mind endlessly. You suffer needlessly because your emotions are ruling your life and are easily upset. With some problems you simply bury your head in the sand or seek to escape in the hope it will all go away - which it doesn't, of course. Because your mind is so impressionable you have to be careful which ideas you let in, especially those pseudo-religious ideals promising much yet delivering little.&nbsp;</font></p>
