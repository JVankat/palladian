    <p align="left" class="article_heading_1"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
    <p class="article_text">The development of Network Enabled Capability (NEC) is one   of the key priorities for the UK Ministry of Defence. It is both a difficult and   highly important problem for our customer community. I have thus been working on   issues related to NEC (and precursor UK concepts such as Digitisation of the   Battlespace) for a number of years. At its core is an understanding of how   better information and a better approach to Command and Control (C2) lead to   both better decisions and improved execution (or operations).</p>
    <p class="article_text">My research on this subject has split fairly well into two   parts: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="article_text">developing a conceptual understanding of and improved   approaches to Command and Control (thus assisting the development of doctrine)   and </li>
      <li class="article_text">developing quantified Operational Analysis (OA) models to   allow assessment of cost-benefit, and balance of investment across the defence   budget. </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">From the start, I took a new approach to the   representation of Command and Control, based on the understanding from   Complexity Theory that simpler agents, joined in a network or hierarchy, can   represent the key effects of higher level Command and Control. This key insight   (which actually pre-dates the formal development of Complexity Theory) has led   to the conceptualization of the Deliberate and Rapid Planning processes, and the   development of a new generation of simulation models which now underpin Dstl&rsquo;s   ability to analyse balance of investment across the equipment budget (including   sensors and command systems), future force structures, and the implications of   high level Defence policy. This approach, involving two canonical planning   processes has also stimulated other developments such as the JOCASTS wargame   used by the UK Joint Services Command and Staff Course (JSCSC at the Defence   Academy), and the HiLOCA model (now owned by Qinetiq).</p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text"> These models can be seen as very abstract,   and far removed from the actual practice of command in the field. In order to   show how they do indeed reflect real aspects of human decision-making, I go on   to discuss some of our experimental data which have helped to test and validate   these models. I also describe some underpinning studies of the nature of command   decision-making in experimental situations, including some recent work looking   at the nature of human decision-making in CBRN[<a href="#f01">1</a>] commanders.   Our focus here is mainly on capturing the decision-making of a commander,   supported by his or her staff. Of course, in the simulation environment, we also   have to capture the way in which such commanders interact with each other in   organizations or coalitions. Finally, I assess our ability to understand and   model network-centric approaches to command and control and identify some areas   that need further work.</p>
    <p align="left" class="article_heading_1"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">I want to start by discussing some background   ideas which have helped to shape the direction of my work. Cybernetics[<a href="#f02">2</a>] is the science of control and communication in the animal and   in the machine, as defined by Norbert Wiener (<a href="#13">Weiner 1948</a>). It   can thus offer up some fundamental insights into the subject of human command   and decision-making. A basic concept in Cybernetics is &lsquo;variety&rsquo; (the number of   different accessible states of a system, and thus a measure of potential system   agility). In particular, Ashby&rsquo;s Law of Requisite Variety, discussed in (<a href="#02">Atkinson and Moffat 2005</a>), indicates that for a system to be in   control, the variety of the controller must balance the variety of the system.   In the Industrial age, our networks and communications gave rise to low control   variety, thus we had to partition the battlespace into sectors, and have   specialised force units, in order to reduce the variety of the battlespace, in   accord with Ashby&rsquo;s Law. Low variety of the physical battlespace was matched to   low variety of the command process. Now as we move into the Information Age, we   foresee a turbulent and uncertain set of futures, and a battlespace with high   variety. Thus we need to construct a representation of the human command and   decision-making process which gives rise to high variety (<a href="#02">Atkinson   and Moffat 2005</a>). In my work I have captured this by creating two   representations of human decision-making denoted Deliberate Planning and Rapid   Planning. Rapid Planning, reacting fast to local circumstances, creates variety.   This is then constrained by more strategic Deliberate Planning in order to   produce the requisite variety of command.</p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">The balance between &lsquo;top down&rsquo; Deliberate   Planning and the more emergent Rapid Planning changes as we progress to more   mature levels of Command and Control. Figure1, taken from (<a href="#07">Moffat   and Alberts 2006</a>) shows these maturity levels explicitly. De-conflicted C2   corresponds to the Industrial Age C2 we discussed earlier, while increasing   levels of maturity take us towards the requirements for Information Age C2.   These maturity levels can also be thought of as milestones on the NEC journey   shown in Figure 2, progressing through the various &lsquo;epochs&rsquo; of NEC as described   in (<a href="#12">UK MoD 2005</a>).</p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text"> At the highest maturity level for the   employed force, Agile C2, such emergent Rapid Planning is constrained by broader   shared awareness and shared intent rather than by Deliberate Planning, and   capturing this type of C2 in our simulation models is the current focus of my   research.</p>

    <p align="left" class="article_heading_1"><strong>Building the Simulation Model   Set</strong></p>
    <p class="article_text">Now I want to show how these ideas have come together to   form the basis of a number of linked closed form (constructive) simulation   models, which underpin Dstl&rsquo;s ability to offer advice on balance of investment   across the equipment budget (including sensors and command systems), future   force structures, and the implications of high level Defence policy (<a href="#11">Taylor and Lane 2004</a>).</p>
    <p class="article_text">Deliberate Planning represents decision-making based on a   rational choice among alternatives. (In cybernetic terms it is a feedforward   process). In such rational choice decision-making the emphasis is on the   explicit generation, and subsequent evaluation, of alternative courses of   action. In military terms it corresponds to the generation of a plan which   involves the allocation of multiple forces both in space and time, in order to   prosecute an intent and objectives. This is complemented by the Rapid Planning   process (in cybernetic terms a feedback process), based on the psychological   construct of naturalistic decision-making. In military terms, the emphasis is on   making sense of the immediate situation, in a rapidly changing environment, and   applying the decision-maker&rsquo;s expert experience of similar situations stored in   long term memory (and built up through training and experience) to jump directly   to a workable solution. The situation is described by a number of cues, which   define a &lsquo;decision space&rsquo;. The stored situations correspond to fuzzy regions in   this decision space.</p>
    <p class="article_text">The mathematical algorithms which implement these two   approaches to human decision-making are described in detail in (<a href="#09">Moffat 2002</a>). In summary, the approach I have adopted is to   strike out on a new path, and exploit novel ideas from complexity mathematics in   order to create a representation of the command process which is sufficient, yet   still transparent. This avoids the use of extensive sets of special expert   system rules (the previous available approach to such issues). Examples of the   simulation models either developed or under development are:</p>

    <p align="left" class="article_heading_1"><strong>Validation of Deliberate and Rapid   Planning through Comparison with Historical Events</strong></p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">In this part of the paper, I want to give some   examples of how these apparently rather abstract models do actually reflect key   aspects of human decision-making by commanders in the field. Indeed, as part of   transitioning such models to the study programme, they have to undergo a   rigorous validation process. This includes both detailed scrutiny of the model   assumptions and behaviour by military officers, and (where possible) comparison   of the model behaviour with historical conflicts of relevance. For example, as   part of the process of commissioning the COMAND model, a detailed comparison was   made between COMAND and the Falklands conflict of 1982. The outputs we examined   were the casualties suffered. Since these are essentially a product of the   number of engagements, and the effectiveness per engagement; if we calibrate the   comparison back to the effectiveness levels per engagement historically   achieved, then this is a fair test of whether we are correctly modelling the   number of engagements (an essential product of the decision-making process).</p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">Since COMAND is a stochastic model this comparison was   between the single actual outcome of the 1982 conflict, and the &lsquo;fan&rsquo; of results   from 160 replications of the COMAND model (<a href="#10">Moffat, Campbell and   Glover 2004</a>). Three main types of agent decision-making were represented in   this comparison: a). In terms of the (<em>Deliberate</em>) campaign plan for   each side&rsquo;s maritime assets, this consisted of a string of missions. At various   points, triggers were built into the plan, allowing it to branch to a new string   of missions dependent on the situation at the trigger point (this might be the   sinking or not of a major warship for example). b). In terms of <em>Rapid   Planning</em>, maritime missions could be adapted to reflect local circumstance.   For example a UK ship in transit to a patrol area could mount an attack of   opportunity if its sensors detected such a threat and the attack was likely to   succeed. c). Air missions were developed and prosecuted as a function of the   sensor information on targets. For example all Argentinean air missions   attacking the UK task force were created by the model (i.e., were generated by   the model, not by scripting) in response to sensor information (mainly from   Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) and sensors based on the Falkland Islands). We   were thus able to explicitly represent both UK and adversary decision-making in   the model.</p>
    <p class="article_text">Entity/group missions are the building blocks of the   scenario and are the key to COMAND&rsquo;s representation of human intelligence is   represented by the decisions made by the various commanders, and the emergent   effect of these decisions. Broadly it was possible to represent all types of   mission: for example, the retreat of the Argentinean navy to port, following the   loss of one of their ships; the regrouping of the various UK ships into a single   amphibious landing force and its subsequent passage to San Carlos.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
      In   terms of overall campaign outcome, we performed a number of comparisons of   casualties (actual versus predicted by the model). The effectiveness per   engagement was scaled back to 1982 levels in the model based on the historical   records and log books in order to reflect the actual probability of a successful   engagement given a set of circumstances. Thus (as discussed earlier) this   comparison was a true test of the validity of our representation of the command   and decision-making processes. Many detailed comparisons were carried out. Just   one of these is shown here (Figure 4), comparing the actual historical record of   the number of UK ships sunk or operationally rendered incapable, versus that   predicted by the model. The result is convincingly close. The decision-making   process represented in the model must thus be close to that which was used in   practice in the historical campaign. This is of course just a single point   estimate. As discussed in (<a href="#10">Moffat, Campbell and Glover 2004</a>),   our models undergo a continuing process of refinement and scrutiny by both   expert analysts and in-house military advisors. </p>

    <p class="article_caption"> Figure 4: Comparison of the Falklands Conflict with   the COMAND simulation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">COMAND is cross-environment and at the campaign   level. As a contrasting example, SIMBAT is a tactical model of Army combat at   the Battlegroup level. I was also able to show that with the inclusion of Rapid   Planning, such tactical models begin to show the correct time and casualty   dynamic associated with such tactical level warfighting. Previously, models at   this level typically indicated a time of battle which was two or three times too   short, due to lack of proper representation of the command process.</p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text"> For example, consider the battle of Goose   Green fought as part of the Falklands war between UK 2 PARA Battlegroup and a   mixed force of Argentinean conscripts during 28/29th May 1982 (<a href="#10">Moffat, Campbell and Glover 2004</a>). The infantry battle started at   midnight and finished at 20:00 the following evening. The Argentinean forces   involved were approximately equal in number to the British. The British force   was highly trained and motivated. However, they were fatigued from six days with   little shelter on the slopes of Sussex mountain, and by an 18Km march to the   battlefield with little sleep. They were also shocked by an air attack on their   ammunition point prior to the march. The British troops were opposed by   Argentinean conscripts with barely four months training and little motivation.   They were, however, fresh for battle, although shocked from low-level tactical   British overflights and surprised by the British move to attack. We discuss   below how these human factors, together with the decision-making process, were   modelled and how the results compared to the reality. </p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">We represented the concept of overall &lsquo;force   strength&rsquo; in the SIMBAT model, as being composed of overall effectiveness. This   was then factored by a number of constraining effects, namely; unit   participation (i.e., the percentage of the force prepared to contribute to the   battle), the effect of being shocked, the effect of being surprised, whether the   troops were close combat trained, and their resilience to fatigue. The detailed   quantitative assumptions are in (<a href="#10">Moffat, Campbell and Glover   2004</a>). This allowed us to define quantitatively, three categories of force;   Strong, Medium and Weak, for both the British and Argentinean forces, which took   account of all of these human factors effects. The SIMBAT model was then run for   each of the 3x3 combinations of force on each side (taking an average of 30   simulation runs in each case, since the model is stochastic). Again, as for the   COMAND model, considering casualties (actual versus predicted by the model) is a   good way of testing whether the decision-making approach represented in the   model accords with what happened in practice. The model shows that these human   factors effects are a dominant determinant of the outcome. Modelling Strong to   Medium British forces versus Weak Argentinean forces gave total casualty results   (and hence a decision-making process) close to the historical record, as   described in detail in (<a href="#10">Moffat, Campbell and Glover 2004</a>). </p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">In the historical battle, there were a number   of key objectives achieved by the British forces, and the times at which they   were achieved were recorded. Thus it was possible to compare the model   prediction of times to these objectives (again averaged over 30 runs of the   model), with this historical record, as shown in Table 1 below. </p>

    <p align="left" class="article_heading_1"><strong>Validation of Rapid Planning Using   Single Decision Gaming</strong></p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">Having now looked at these models of conflict in some   detail, I want to turn now to some of the underpinning research. This also helps   to demonstrate that our approach is anchored in real human effects. </p>
    <p class="article_text">We have extended the basic form of the Rapid Planning   process using non-linear utility theory (<a href="#03">Dodd, Moffat and Smith   2006</a>), in order to help us to explain why decisions differ qualitatively   dependent on the decision-makers&rsquo; experiences and preferences. More precisely we   wish to understand:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="article_text">How the objective inputs (based on incoming information)   and the subjective inputs (based on an individual&rsquo;s training, experience and   personality) combine in the decision-making process. </li>
      <li class="article_text">How considerations of utility influence this process; in   particular, when there are conflicting local and global values within the   decision-making structure. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="article_heading_2"><em>Theoretical Perspective</em></p>
    <p class="article_text">The missions described in our experimental situation are   simplified to just two levels of attributes. The first set of attributes   measures the local outcome of the mission in terms of relatively immediate,   &lsquo;close-to-home&rsquo; considerations (such as loss of tactical assets). The second set   of attributes measures longer-term and more global concerns related to more   strategic considerations (for example, integrity of the NATO campaign). Our   analysis describes how this tension between local and global concerns can   formally be modelled. </p>
    <p class="article_text">The choice of course of action depends on the   interpretation of mission orders (i.e., weighing of priorities in terms of   utilities) and the subjective situation assessment (i.e., weighing of evidence   derived from subjective informational attributes). The commander may be unable   simultaneously to reconcile, even partially, the objectives associated with the   attributes pertaining to the high-level mission objectives and his own local   appreciation of immediate potential threat. When this happens he may be forced   to choose an action that focuses on local, shorter-term success, marginalising   the longer-term implications of his action. Alternatively, he may place more   weight on global concerns. This tension between objectives is the basis for the   derivation of the subjective utility and depends on subjective descriptors of   the conflict situation, interpretation of the mission orders, and general   appreciation of the situation. The relative importance each commander places on   local and global objectives is central to a conceptual understanding of &lsquo;value&rsquo;   in decision-making. It seems that such qualitative relationships are enduring in   this context and that they provide a useful framework for C2 modelling.</p>
    <p class="article_text">In practice, most Bayesian decision analyses usually begin   by assuming that the decision-maker&rsquo;s utility function, <em>U</em>, has an   associated set of value-independent &lsquo;situation&rsquo; attributes (<a href="#06">Keeny   and Raiffa 1976</a>). In our application, these attributes are associated with   situation features that are immediately local to the decision-maker and those   that have a longer-term, more global impact. For a decision, <em>d</em>, a   decision-maker's utility function thus has to capture the trade-off between the   different goals by assigning weights, <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image009.gif" alt="005" width="146" height="15" class="equations" /> to reflect the   importance of achieving the desired values of the attributes, whose achievement   is evaluated by the utilities. (<img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image011.gif" alt="006" width="11" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;is   a set of shape parameters describing his utility function). </p>
    <p class="article_text">Projected future values of the attributes are represented   by a probability distribution function <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image013.gif" alt="007" width="79" height="17" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;which reflects the decision-maker's current (subjective)   probability of the outcome <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image015.gif" alt="008" width="11" height="17" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;relative to the goal attribute <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image017.gif" alt="012" width="12" height="13" align="absbottom" class="equations" />, given decision <em>d</em>, where <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image019.gif" alt="013" width="12" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;is a set of shape parameters for this probability distribution. </p>
    <p class="article_text">The decision-maker should thus choose <em>d</em> to   maximise the utility function <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image021.gif" alt="015" width="50" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />,   averaging over his beliefs about different outcomes <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image015_0000.gif" alt="009" width="11" height="17" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;and their utilities. The decision-maker also   implicitly sets weights <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image024.gif" alt="016" width="33" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;reflecting, for instance, his priorities and ambitions. In   military settings a decision-maker will be held accountable for his chosen   course of action <em>d</em>. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the   specific nature of the mission objectives and the previously absorbed general   training and personal history will be reflected in the commander's setting of <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image024_0000.gif" alt="017" width="33" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" /><strong>&nbsp;. </strong></p>
    <p class="article_heading_2"><em>The Single Decision Game</em></p>
    <p class="article_text">A single decision game was thus designed to measure the   predisposition of commanders, in a situation in which they should be experts, by   requiring them to make a rapid determination of a course of action. Participants   were presented with an initial operational picture and situation brief.   Following ten minutes to appraise the situation, an Intelligence report was   briefed which might (or might not) demand action. The participants were then   asked to choose and write down a course of action without being given further   time for analysis. The Intelligence update was designed to give them some room   for choosing different courses of action so that their pre-dispositions were   allowed to surface as variations in choice.</p>
    <p class="article_text">After the course of action was selected, participants were   invited to record their situation appraisal and assessments along with the key   indicators considered relevant to their course of action choice. It was accepted   that this data might reflect post-hoc rationalisation to some extent. To account   for any changes in situation assessment due to the process of having to analyse   and express it, the participants were also offered the opportunity to record any   other courses of action that they may have considered. The experimental game   results give us a context within which to explore and test our non-linear   utility theory; in particular, the ways in which individuals&rsquo; predispositions   affect the weights given to the situational attributes. It appears that the   extent to which each attribute is (or is not) considered in the pattern-matching   process of Rapid Planning strongly determines the choice of course of action.   The experimental game was based on decisions at Battlegroup and Company levels   set in two different conflict scenarios: war-fighting and peace-support.</p>
    <p class="article_heading_2"><em>War-Fighting Scenario</em></p>
    <p class="article_text">The war-fighting game was played after participants had   taken part in a related Brigade-level planning exercise, forming part of a   broader series of games organised by Graham Mathieson of Dstl, examining all of   the factors bearing on the decision-making process. This provided them with a   good appreciation of the operational context. The participants were focused on a   decision concerning a Battlegroup (BG) of three tank Companies located in hides   on a large wooded ridge feature called Elfas (circled top middle-left in Figure   5). Enemy armoured and mechanised units could be seen travelling along roads   either side of the ridge. The Brigade&rsquo;s mission was to delay the enemy&rsquo;s advance   for twenty-four hours until bridges to the West could be secured. A full written   brief was presented that described the current operational status of all units   within the Brigade&rsquo;s area of interest. Then followed a situation update as   depicted in Figure 5. </p>
    <p class="article_text">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="article_caption"><img src="../images4/v1n1_Moffat_05.gif" alt="05" width="550" height="428" /><br />
      Figure 5: Situation Update for the Warfighting   Scenario.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="article_text">The situation update indicates probable enemy airborne   deployments to the West of the Elfas feature. The strength of these deployments   is not known but is assessed as an augmented Company. The participants were   asked to write down immediately their course of action. As the BG commander in   the field HQ there are several courses of action available, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="article_text">remain in hides and do nothing; </li>
      <li class="article_text">request more information; </li>
      <li class="article_text">attack North/North-East (hoping for surprise) against the   armoured enemy units; </li>
      <li class="article_text">attack West directly against the reported deployment of   airborne troops; </li>
      <li class="article_text">maintain a South-East withdrawal route to join-up with   own forces. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="article_text">The decisions taken across the twenty-four participants   (all UK army officers) appear to vary according to the way that they have taken   account of the situation attributes and the higher-level mission orders. Some   participants choose to give very little (if any) weight to the higher-level   mission orders and focus on achieving effects that satisfy local utility. This   local view of the mission in some cases tends to extend to the use and   interpretation of the situation attributes in terms of both space and time. For   example, the situation may be appraised purely as a snapshot in time (i.e.,   little or no forward projection) so that decision outcomes are assessed only   from the point of view of the BG, ignoring the overall Brigade mission. </p>
    <p class="article_text">The analysis reveals two concurrent, inter-dependent   assessment processes: threat and risk assessment. For those participants who are   not so concerned about the uncertainty in the situation update, the relative   weightings of the BG and Brigade mission priorities coupled with the practical   consideration of employing tanks against dismounted airborne troops, result in   two very different courses of action. Some choose to attack West (employing   tanks against dismounted troops and preventing link-up and closure of the gap   West of Luthorst) while others choose to attack North/N-East using tanks against   tanks and adhering to Brigade orders. Where there is uncertainty and lack of   confidence, the participants choose either to keep tanks in reserve; or prepare   for attack while doing further reconnaissance; or secure a withdrawal route to   rejoin the southern BG; or simply do nothing, remain in hides and report to   Brigade. There is further discussion of these alternatives and their motivation   in (<a href="#03">Dodd, Moffat and Smith 2006</a>).</p>
    <h1 class="article_heading_1">Peace-Support Scenario</h1>
    <p class="article_text">The peace-support scenario was set in a fictitious   federation and involved provision of armed support for conveyance of supplies   and civilians to and from a NATO-protected enclave East of the &lsquo;Nettoyer Pass&rsquo;,   as shown in Figure 6.</p>
    <p class="article_text">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="../images4/v1n1_Moffat_06.gif" alt="06" width="550" height="428" /></p>
    <p class="article_caption">Figure 6: Peace-Support Scenario.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="article_text">Following the break-up of the federation, the two major   factions were left in a state of armed stand-off. The NATO Task Force, with the   UK acting as the lead nation, was a Division-sized force with the task of   disarming the ethnic militia. NATO forces also had undertaken to escort and   protect all aid convoys. The broader NATO mission was to restore peace and   stability to the area in order to create the conditions for a free vote by the   population on the future of the region. </p>
    <p class="article_text"> The Intelligence update was sent to the tactical   commander in the form of a radio message from an armed unit with two Land Rovers   escorting a civilian relief convoy of six vehicles. The armed convoy was stopped   at a probable Illegal Vehicle Control Point (IVCP) in a mountain pass as it   returned from delivering supplies to the enclave.<strong> </strong>The IVCP   consisted of twelve men, armed with AK-47 assault rifles and at least two   RPG-7&rsquo;s. The second escort Land Rover was 500m to the rear of the convoy. We   focus here on the decision-making of the commander at the field HQ located at   Var (see Figure 6). There are several courses of action available; for example: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="article_text">Order the UK troops to negotiate their way out of the   situation; </li>
      <li class="article_text">Order a withdrawal to move the civilian convoy vehicles   to a safe distance; </li>
      <li class="article_text">Do nothing and hope that the militia let the unit and   convoy through eventually; </li>
      <li class="article_text">Deploy the quick reaction force (QRF) and move artillery   units to fire positions. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="article_text">There are well-defined NATO rules of engagement: for   example, personal, direct-fire and indirect-fire weapons may be used to engage a   positively identified threat.</p>
    <p class="article_text">Here the immediate potential outcomes of the mission are   measured against attribute <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image031.gif" alt="021" width="10" height="11" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;and   scored by utility function <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image033.gif" alt="023" width="14" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />.   This evaluates features that have consequences local to the situation, such as   an escalation of the immediate threat by ambush or weapon-firing, the reduced   security of the civilians in the convoy and likelihood of kidnap, theft of   supplies, etc. The second attribute <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image035.gif" alt="024" width="11" height="11" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;is   scored by <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image037.gif" alt="026" width="14" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />,   evaluating more global issues concerning, for example, the integrity of the NATO   campaign and political perceptions of NATO&rsquo;s ability to show resolve while   adhering to the rules of engagement. The nature of peace-support operations   generally means that the command structure tends to be flatter and with a less   explicit hierarchy of mission orders (in contrast to the war-fighting scenario).   Therefore we would expect the course of action selection to be driven more from   the situation attributes than from the weighting of mission priorities. </p>
    <p class="article_text">The decision model then is as follows:<br />
      <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image039.gif" alt="027" width="37" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;is   the subjective priority weighting of local effects.<br />
      <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image041.gif" alt="028" width="38" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;is the subjective priority weighting of global effects   .<br />
      <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image043.gif" alt="029" width="53" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />is   the utility of the decision with respect to local outcomes.<br />
      <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image045.gif" alt="030" width="56" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />is   the utility of the decision with respect to more strategic consequences.<br />
      <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image019_0000.gif" alt="014" width="12" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;is a vector of shaping parameters for the subjective   distribution of probable outcomes, and represents the general level of the   commander&rsquo;s uncertainty in the situation.</p>
    <p class="article_text">The local features for attribute <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image031_0000.gif" alt="022" width="10" height="11" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;typically concern the potential for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="article_text">Escalation of threat (in particular an ambush or firing   of weapons); </li>
      <li class="article_text">Loss of civilian life; </li>
      <li class="article_text">Own force casualties; </li>
      <li class="article_text">Theft of convoy assets; </li>
      <li class="article_text">Taking of hostages. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="article_text">The global features for attribute <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image035_0000.gif" alt="025" width="11" height="11" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;are typically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="article_text">Show of strength against NATO resolve to restore   stability; </li>
      <li class="article_text">Provocation to create over-reaction and heightened   regional tension. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="article_text">In order to plot in two dimensions the participants&rsquo;   decision space, the features are combined into two measures that represent the   seriousness of the terrorist threat and the sense of provocation through a show   of strength. The former reflects the indications for ambush and imminent need to   address a real threat with direct force. The latter measure embodies the   features concerned with the need to avoid escalation. We can then plot the   participants&rsquo; situation assessments in this two-dimensional decision space (<a href="#03">Dodd, Moffat and Smith 2006</a>). Overlaid onto this situation   assessment plot is the grouping of the participants into their course of action   choices. They form coherent areas in the decision space. This shows how the   pattern matching process of Rapid Planning leads directly to a choice of course   of action.</p>
    <p class="article_text">Based on the results of these games, the Rapid Planning   process representation has been extended to include weightings on the cues which   span the decision space, and utility curves similar to those of Prospect Theory   (<a href="#05">Kahneman and Tversky 1979</a>) which represent the utility of a   cue value given a particular course of action. Thus for a given cue <em>j</em>,   we define a weight <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image050.gif" alt="031" width="14" height="14" align="absbottom" class="equations" />,   with <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image052.gif" alt="032" width="59" height="17" align="absbottom" class="equations" />,   and <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image054.gif" alt="033" width="56" height="29" align="absmiddle" class="equations" />.   For each cue <em>j</em> with outcome values <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image015_0001.gif" alt="010" width="11" height="17" align="absbottom" class="equations" />, and each course of action <em>d</em>, we also define a   non-linear utility curve <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image057.gif" alt="034" width="54" height="17" align="absbottom" class="equations" />.   The cue value <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image015_0002.gif" alt="011" width="11" height="17" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;at any given point in time will have an uncertainty associated   with it, and thus a probability distribution of values <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image060.gif" alt="035" width="35" height="17" align="absbottom" class="equations" />. We combine these together to obtain the overall utility <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image062.gif" alt="036" width="177" height="24" align="absmiddle" class="equations" />&nbsp;.   We then sum this over all cues to obtain the overall utility of the course of   action <em>d </em>as follows:</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image064.gif" alt="037" width="121" height="29" class="equations" /></p>
    <p class="article_text"> In the extended form of the Rapid Planning process,   this is used to choose between a course of action which is consistent with   higher level orders, and one which is locally more appropriate (through   comparing their relative utilities). Implementation in the HiLOCA model shows   encouraging results (see for example (<a href="#04">Dodd, Richardson and Alston   2006</a>)).</p>
    <p class="article_heading_1"><strong>Validation of Rapid Planning Using Card   Based Decision Games</strong></p>
    <p class="article_text">Recently, we have examined the decision-making of CBRN   Commanders using experimental gaming (<a href="#08">Moffat, Medhurst and Tilley   2007</a>). These decision games have allowed statistical models of their   decision-making behaviour to be developed that are able to significantly predict   the probability of making a given command choice, given the information   presented to the commander, accounting for 60% to 80% of the variance in   outcome. The statistical models imply that the decision-making is of the form   implied by the Rapid Planning process, as we shall see. They involve a decision   space (defined by a number of weighted information cues) and a number of   discrete regions in this space corresponding to the decision options   (alternative courses of action). As information about the cues is updated, the   estimate of the position in the decision space is updated, leading to a   potential change of course of action.</p>
    <p class="article_text"> Two cases were considered. In the first the commander   had to decide whether to issue a &lsquo;precautionary alert&rsquo; to troops in theatre,   leading to the donning of protective clothing, or whether to declare a &lsquo;probable   attack&rsquo;, including the taking of medical countermeasures and reporting to higher   command of a probable biological attack. This decision was based on information   from sensors (e.g., the possible detection of a biological agent), and other   contextual data (such as casualty reports, or shifts in weather patterns). It   was thus essentially a single decision process, based on accumulating   information. In the second set of decision games, the commander had to decide on   the protective dress state for the force, and whether or not to continue   advancing, based on prevailing information. He could raise or lower the dress   state of the force a number of times during the game, based on the accumulating   information as the game progressed. There were three choices: Dress State 1   (DS1), Dress State 2 (DS2), and Dress State with respirator (DSR). In the   decision game, raising the dress state gave more protection, but slowed the   force down.</p>
    <p class="article_text"> In each game, information was presented to the   commander using cards. These were of different types, corresponding to different   classes of information. The cards were presented one by one, and the commander   wove these together in his mind to form a &lsquo;story&rsquo; of the unfolding scenario. The   cards were presented in essentially random order (thus there was no   pre-scripting of the set of events).</p>
    <p class="article_text"> Statistical analysis of the data from the first set of   games (the single decision games), shows that a probit analysis gives an   extremely good fit to the data. Thus our model of the process is as follows.</p>
    <p class="article_text">There are three possible actions the commander can   take:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="article_text">j=0 (no alert issued); </li>
      <li class="article_text">j=1 (precautionary alert issued) ; </li>
      <li class="article_text">j=2 (probable attack issued). </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="article_text">We should then note that the weights <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image086.gif" alt="049" width="10" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;turn out to be all negative, so that as the number of cards <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image070_0000.gif" alt="041" width="9" height="11" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;of a given type increases, we are moving towards the origin of   the <em>x</em>- axis, and thus &lsquo;climbing up the probability slope of the   logistic transform&rsquo; (i.e., the probability <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image088.gif" alt="051" width="65" height="17" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;is increasing).</p>
    <p class="article_text"> In terms of a decision process, we can thus illustrate   this as shown in Figure 9, where the value 0.5 is illustrative, and where there   are only two information types.</p>
    <p class="article_text"> We define two regions in Figure 9. The first (Region   A) corresponds to the set of values <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image090.gif" alt="052" width="43" height="18" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;(i.e., the number of cards of each of the two information types   which have already been shown to the commander), and for which the probability   is <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image094.gif" alt="055" width="31" height="11" align="bottom" class="equations" />. This   corresponds to the region of the decision space within which the commander would   choose the course of action &lsquo;issue precautionary alert or higher&rsquo;. The second   region (Region B) is the subset of Region A corresponding to the set of values <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image090_0000.gif" alt="053" width="43" height="18" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;for which the probability <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image096.gif" alt="057" width="139" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />&nbsp;is <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image094_0000.gif" alt="056" width="31" height="11" align="bottom" class="equations" />.   This corresponds to the region within which the commander would choose the   course of action &lsquo;issue probable attack warning&rsquo;.</p>

      Figure 9: How the changing values of the cues (the   numbers of cards of each information type) affects the decision taken.</p>
    <p class="article_text">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="article_text"> The cues of the decision process are thus the   different information categories in this case, and they are weighted by the   constants <img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image086_0000.gif" alt="050" width="10" height="15" align="absbottom" class="equations" />. The regions corresponding to the different decisions are   represented probabilistically, corresponding to fuzzy membership functions (as   in the Rapid Planning process itself (<a href="#09">Moffat 2002</a>)). Overall,   this simple model, where the cues correspond to the information types, can   account for 60% of the variability in Pr (probable attack issued) (P<img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image104.gif" alt="059" width="9" height="10" class="equations" />j=2), and 80% of the   variability in Pr (precautionary alert or higher issued) (P<img src="../images4/journal_v1n1_02_clip_image104_0000.gif" alt="060" width="9" height="10" class="equations" />j=1). This obviously gives confidence that the model is representing a   significant element of the real decision-making process. </p>
    <p class="article_text"> An analysis of the second game (which allowed movement   between the three states DS1, DS2 and DSR) shows that the commanders&rsquo; decisions   can be captured in a similar way, and in fact form a simple Markov process,   which is also to be expected from Rapid Planning considerations (<a href="#09">Moffat 2002</a>).</p>
    <p class="article_text"> In each case, then, the statistical model which   explains the commanders&rsquo; decision-making process <em>is</em> the Rapid Planning   process (to an acceptable level of approximation), and is thus a relatively   simple probabilistic model, rather than one based on complex, embedded and   deterministic decision rules. </p>
    <p class="article_text"> A key contributor to the residual unexplained   variation in our statistical model is due to the intrinsic difference between   each pair of players. Thus capturing more of this variation would involve   explicitly representing this difference in personality, training and   experience.</p>
    <p align="left" class="article_heading_1"><strong>An Assessment and the Way   Forward</strong></p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text"> The simulation models which we have built,   incorporating these concepts of decision-making at their core, represent a   significant monetary and intellectual investment by the UK MoD. This investment   has yielded significant improvements in our ability to systematically address a   number of issues related to the development of NEC. As described in detail   earlier, the Rapid Planning process and aspects of the Deliberate Planning   process have been implemented in a number of these models. They are thus   sufficient to take us along the journey from our current capabilities to the   &lsquo;NEC Transition&rsquo; epoch of NEC (<a href="#12">UK MoD 2005</a>) as shown in Figure   2. </p>
    <p align="left" class="article_text">However, our understanding of Agile C2 and the Mature   stage of NEC, envisaged as towards the end of the NEC journey, are still not   sufficient for the full development of tools and methods by which they can be   modelled. A key shortcoming is our relative inability to model the agility of&nbsp; <em>task organised force units</em>. I am thus continuing to work on enhancing   both our conceptual understanding, and the model set, to capture these   ideas.</p>
    <p class="article_text">This requires a proper representation, in the constructive   simulation environment, of how &lsquo;edge organisations&rsquo; (Alberts and Hayes, 2004)   share situational awareness (including command intent) and constrain the   emergent behaviour of a number of interacting entities in order to produce the   natural synchronisation indicated in Figure 2. It also requires the ability,   with Agile C2, to shape and adapt the C2 approach to the changing circumstances   in a timely manner. </p>
