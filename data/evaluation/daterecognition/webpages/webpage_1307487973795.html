	<p class="byline">Nov 27th 2004 1:26AM</p>

	<div class="post">
		<p>
  I&#8217;ve decided to start a new hedge fund. However, this hedge fund won&#8217;t invest in stocks or bonds, or any type of<br />
  business. It&#8217;s going to be a fund that only places bets. A gambling hedge fund.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be me figuring out what bets to place, or what games to play. This is a fund.I will find the<br />
  best and the brightest, with a confirmable track record and hire them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an idea whose time has come.</p>
<p>Ihave bet on stocks long and short for about 15 years now. I&#8217;ve done very well. There has already been one<br />
  hedge fund started based on my trading results. In those 15 years, I have learned that despite all the claims<br />
  and books written about efficient markets, the trading of individual stocks are not efficient. There are always<br />
  people trading on better or worse information. There are always people trading onemotion rather than logic.<br />
  There are always people trading on hopes of the bighit.What Peter Lynch would call the &#8220;10 Bagger&#8221;. They<br />
  were gambling. Nothing more. Nothing less.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual to hear people refer to trading stocks as no different than going to Vegas. They are right.<br />
  Gambling isgambling.</p>
<p>The question really is, which gives the opportunity for a better outcome?</p>
<p>If you play the slots in vegas, you can read what the payout ratios are for each casino.97 pct. 98 pct. If<br />
  youplay longenough, thecasino will end up with 2 or 3 pct of your money. Unless of course you<br />
  go up to the winning side while you play, and quit while your ahead.</p>
<p>The stockmarket equivalent would be to buy an AtThe Money Long Term(LEAP)Put for 2 or 3 pct of<br />
  the stock price. The put would protect your downside for several years, and the stock would only have breakeven or<br />
  upside potential over that period. It&#8217;s a nice thing, except that it&#8217;s much, much, much more expensive than 3 pct. As<br />
  a point of reference, IBM which is trading at about 94 today, has a price of $5.90 for Jan 2006 95 puts. It&#8217;s $7.90<br />
  for Jan 2007 puts. Just to protect yourself on the downside for less than 2 months, till the 3rd week of Jan 05, will<br />
  cost you $2.40, or about the same percentage as the hold the house puts on you in playing slots in Vegas.</p>
<p>Of course tha&#8217;ts for slots. If you play blackjack. The odds are better and every now and then in your favor. If<br />
  you play poker, you are playing against the other players, and the house only takes its commission. Just like your<br />
  broker takes its commission.</p>
<p>Unlike the stockmarket, you know the rules exactly.You know without question, the house is going to play by<br />
  the rules. The gaming commission appears to actually enforce rules of play, unlike the SEC.</p>
<p>And then there are sports bets. Like any other investment or bet, the question always come down to whether there<br />
  is good information available, who knows how to use it better, and who is the competition and are they smart or<br />
  not.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know if the best and brightest go to Wall Street or Vegas. I don&#8217;t know the number of gamblers<br />
  via sports books in vegas vs the the number ofgamblers, I mean investors, in the stockmarket.</p>
<p>I do know this. Most casual gamblers,who are the majority of the money spent,go to vegas expecting to<br />
  lose money. It&#8217;s part of the entertainment experience. People put money in mutual funds and in their brokerage<br />
  accounts and pick stocks expecting to make money. They don&#8217;t find any value in losing money on a stock, fund or other<br />
  traditional investment. That changes the opportunity completely.</p>
<p>How efficient can a market be when the majority of investor expect to lose money? The sportsbooks know this. They<br />
  know the difference between smart and stupid money.</p>
<p>  They set odds in order to attract as much emotional, stupid money as it possibly can.It also knows that<br />
  thisemotional money will skew the odds and bring in the &#8220;smart money&#8221;. As a result, they have learned to lay<br />
  off their investments so that they arejust taking their cut off the dollars invested rather than trying to<br />
  outsmart the smart.</p>
<p>To me, this suggests the smart money is better than just good. It&#8217;s very good.</p>
<p>Which raises the question of &#8220;How did the smart money get smart &#8220;, and do they get better returns on their bets<br />
  than investors can buying the S&amp;P500? Can it significantly outperform the S&amp;P as this new fund would be<br />
  expected to do?</p>
<p>The smart money doesn&#8217;t brag about their results, but in the minimal reading and conversations I have had, it&#8217;s<br />
  the same people coming back over and over again. The smart money people are doing something right on a repetitive<br />
  basis.</p>
<p>When you think about betting on sports, there really is far better information about your local sports team than<br />
  there is about any local business in your market. The local papers cover the team every day. The localTV<br />
  station gives a report about every game. There areradio stations who cover them for hours at a time. That&#8217;s far<br />
  more information than you get aboutTyco orComputer Associatesor NFI.</p>
<p>In sports, when someone does something wrong, they pretty much tell you the next day or two. Someone suspended<br />
  You know it. Someone hurt  They report it, and do a better job of policing that than any industry watchgroup.</p>
<p>And stats? my goodness. There is no comparison. You can tape everything and create your own stats, which I&#8217;m sure<br />
  every &#8220;smart money&#8221; gambler does. There are public play-by-plays of every game.There are websites that<br />
  analyze every which way from sunday every action and inaction of every player in the game.</p>
<p>There also is no such thing as insider information either.Player and team reps can&#8217;t talk to<br />
  knowngamblers, but do they really need to?</p>
<p>Reporters are there after every practice to interview the players and coaches. They ask the same questions that<br />
  every gambler wants to know, if only so they know who to pick for their fantasy teams. They also get to see and<br />
  report on who is there and who isn&#8217;t and who is limping and who isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s far better than we get from public companies. Not only can they not disclose material information on a<br />
  daily basis, theytry their very best to hide their actual performance when they are required to supposedly<br />
  disclose all information.</p>
<p>Public companies play so many games with their numbers it&#8217;s ridiculous. Should they expense options or not? Per<br />
  forma vs GAAP? One time write offs? Buying company after company? Writing down inventories then reselling them?</p>
<p>My favorite is beating the estimates by a penny quarter after quarter. Could you imagine a team that beat its<br />
  competition by 1 point every game? Business, like sports, is not that predictable.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that the information is so good that this is a slamdunk investment. Sales don&#8217;t get closed,<br />
  product cycles get pushed back, drugs don&#8217;t work as expected and players drop passes, miss shots and get hurt.</p>
<p>The argument can be made that this is much riskier than a bond, where unless the company goes out of business, you<br />
  get paid the interest rate. Pick a strong company or the government and you are relatively safe. All true. That&#8217;s why<br />
  i love bonds .</p>
<p>You could also make the argument that when you buy a stock, you own part of a company.Legally it&#8217;s true. In<br />
  practice it&#8217;s not.For non-dividend paying companies, you have nothing but a piece of paper. The only hope you<br />
  have if that company starts todecline is to findsomeone whowill buy it from you.</p>
<p>A sports or blackjack or poker bet doesn&#8217;t have value beyond that game or hand. In that respect it&#8217;s just like the<br />
  hundreds of millions, if not billions ,of options that are traded, but never converted, on stocks, commodities and<br />
  other assets around the world every day.</p>
<p>Just what hedge funds do on a daily basis, and just what I plan on doing.</p>

		<p>Wow, the amount of posts on here is incredible.<br />
While I am not sure whether you are serious or just going for dry wit regarding the state iof the stock market, but here&#8217;s what I had to say on <a href="http://thenats.blogspot.com/2004/12/fool-proof.html" rel="nofollow">http://thenats.blogspot.com/2004/12/fool-proof.html</a> when someone mentioned it to me (some of it was said tongue-in-cheek but I believe the theory is sound):</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br />
So, when Don Money asked me if Mark Cuban&#8217;s hedge fund for sports gambling would be something I would invest in, I needed to post my &#8220;if I only lived in Vegas&#8221; musings to answer fully.</p>
<p>Yes, DM, I would, but only if Mr. Cuban met with me for a few minutes first to discuss what I believe is a foolproof plan for sports gambling if you had the time and money.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps you may have heard of the doubling system in Blackjack. Essentially, that is a betting system that is &#8220;in theory&#8221; foolproof. What it requires is that you start off with a bet, let&#8217;s say $1. If you win, you put that $1 profit away, and you bet $1 again. Every time you lose, however, you double the bet&#8211;i.e., if you lose, you bet $2 next, then $4, then $8, etc. When you finally win a hand, you will have recouped your losses and actually won $1. You put that $1 profit away and start over.</p>
<p>The casinos know this, which is the reason that blackjack tables have maximum bets (you thought it was because they didn&#8217;t want you to lose more than $5000 at a time?). The maximum bet rule stops the doubling system because while you will definitely win a hand eventually, you may actually lose the 11 or so hands in a row it will take you to be more than $5000 down at a $5-$10 minimum table. If there was no such maximum, and you had a serious bankroll, you could make blackjack a career and never lose. With the maximum limit, you can lose and lose a lot.</p>
<p>Sports betting in Vegas is subject to no such maximums of which I know. Therefore, the doubling system should in theory be foolproof. The beauty of it is also that it doesn&#8217;t matter who you bet on, what sport, or what knowledge you have as long as you follow two important rules: 1) only bet on the 50-50 spread and over/under lines (as opposed to odds, parlays, money lines, etc.) and 2) do not bet on multiple things at once.</p>
<p>This works especially well during baseball season (for over/under run totals) [note: thenats.blogspot.com is obviously a DC baseball site] when there are multiple game starts throughout the day. Assuming you start on the first day of the season, figure about 190 days of baseball and about two-three segments of games (2pm eastern, 8pm eastern, 11pm eastern) each day, so you&#8217;d be making about 500 bets a season. Let&#8217;s assume $100 per bet, each win gets you a profit of $100 (I&#8217;m ignoring the percentages that the casino takes&#8211;you can adjust the bets accordingly to take this into account ($110 to win $100 the first time, $231 to win $210 the second time, etc.)). With 50-50 odds, you should win approximately 250 of the bets leading to a profit of $25,000.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t live in Vegas and I don&#8217;t have Mark Cuban&#8217;s bankroll. But, Mr. Cuban, if you use this strategy and add to your billions, I expect a small cut <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1305690953g' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>Us quants don&#8217;t need to figure this stuff out, cause Joe Six Pack can&#8217;t either. All we need to do is predict the non-random stuff better than Joe Six Pack.</p>

		<p>Intriguing idea.  As with numerous concepts, many are skeptical at first, but then the legitimacy of the business catches on.  I, for one, think it is innovative and will be anxious to see how well it does.  It will also be interesting to see how both the NBA and the different financial regulatory agencies react to this concept.  Looking for any help, Mr. Cuban?</p>

		<p>From a pure gambling and statistical perspective this won&#8217;t work.  Gambling has house edges, mathematically built in to ALL gambling games.  Take for instance roulette, the house edge is 5.2% and in blackjack the house edge is approximately 1.5% (depending on which type of game you play).  The laws of large numbers tells you that if you play enough times you will lose.  The same thing applies in sports gambling.  Let&#8217;s take the example of picking an NFL football game vs the point spread.  The house/casino sets the point spread in such a way that splits the money wagered as evenly possible on both teams.  It&#8217;s a very efficient system, and what the house does to gaurantee themselves a profit is to set payouts at something like $10 on every $11 bet.  If the house can split the money wagered evenly between the two bets, they make out like bandits.</p>
<p>Mr Cuban, if you want to make money gambling, I&#8217;d recommend that you open up your own Casino.  </p>
<p>Fun idea, but not a money maker.</p>

		<p>Mark, </p>
<p>I work as an associate analyst at a large Toronto investment bank. I am also an avid sports enthusiast that has bet on sports (currently the gm of a fantasy football and basketball league) and consistently won. </p>
<p>I have actually suggested your idea to a number of friends on multiple occasions before I read todays article in the financial post (most look at me oddly, but many &#8216;get&#8217; the concept and love the idea). </p>
<p>I advise pension and hedge funds where to put their money. I also &#8216;invest&#8217; in sports. Quite frankly, the informational content, and regulatory environment is a lot clearer in sports, which makes sports a much more logical &#8216;investment&#8217; vehicle. </p>
<p>You are absolutely correct in your interpretation of the market. I&#8217;ll add that being a research analyst for a sports team is not dissimilar from being an analyst for a company&#8230;its just more sensible to &#8216;invest&#8217; in sports. </p>
<p>The key would be recruit personnel that know their sport inside and out but also have the financial background to understand markets and how they work. </p>
<p>I bet you it would be very easy to recruit willing young grads of different disciplines to work for you at this kind of a firm. I personally would take a huge pay cut for the opportunity. Who wouldn&#8217;t be willing to give up a lot (given an appropriate upside of course) to spend my time researching players and stats in basketball as opposed to stocks? I do it for free anyways. </p>
<p>If you can get by the regulatory hurdles, your potential market is huge. HUGE. You stand to make a lot of money on this one. </p>
<p>If you are interested I really would love to work for you at this firm. Please dont hesitate to email me. </p>
<p>Otherwise good luck &#8211; I&#8217;ll keep an eye out for your fund.</p>

		<p>In Response to skybox from post #107 I agree with the haltime strategies and have had the same vision of setting up a gambling network on no name college campuses across the country.  I have been kicked off a website for betting halftime lines because they said I had to bet 50% game lines and 50% halftime lines because they said halftime lines are weak.  I would be interested in helping develop your network or being apart of it.  You can email me at <a href="mailto:joesb26@hotmail.com">joesb26@hotmail.com</a>.</p>

		<p>I see a lot of people referring to gambling as a &#8220;zero sum game&#8221;. INCORRECT. A roulette wheel is a &#8220;zero sum game&#8221;; however, a horse race or a sports bet isn&#8217;t NECESSARILY a zero sum game.</p>
<p>The most exploitable gaming market is horse racing.  Yes, the takeout is steep, but the market is often grossly inefficient, despite the incredible amount of information available and attainable- specifically the exotics pools.  Typical handicappers do not take the effects of correlation in to account when they bet into the exacta or trifecta pools, creating payoffs often much greater than the actual probability of occurance.  (The classic example would be two favored, speed type horses running exach other in to the ground- while one will often hold on for 1st or 2nd, the probablility they both will is often much lower than their favored exacta or trifecta payoff, creating a tremendous betting opportunity with a logical mid to longshot picking up the pieces.) The ability to hedge with (or against) multi-race wagers allows money management on superexotics like pick-6&#8242;s.</p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is futures bets- perhaps the fastest 2YO in the country was 200-1 to win the Kentucky Derby this year on January 1st, simply because not enough people did their homework on Philadelphia Park.  What other market would give you that kind of odds?</p>

		<p>Some general comments… Regardless of what Mark has up his sleeve with this – he’s dead on with his assertion that ‘picking’ stocks, etc. is NO DIFFERENT than betting on sports. In both, you are predicting that an individual or team of individuals will PERFORM (or WON’T perform). If they perform as you expected (the CEO, the managers, the coach, the players), AND unexpected outside forces don&#8217;t get in the way, you will make money. In both, you can use information, research, hunches, emotion, tips, advice, mathematical formulas, technical systems, or a combination of all of the above! In both you can use discipline and money management to be successful at it. And both the outcomes of sporting events and the movement of stock prices are WILDLY unpredictable. In both &#8211; the people making the real money are people on the &#8216;other&#8217; side from the masses (brokers, advisors, fund managers, exchanges, sports books) or the people &#8216;in the know&#8217;. The people that make the real money are the people immune to the outcome of the events themselves, who either have a winning formula, or who sell an ‘entry fee’ so all of us can play the game&#8230; We will share more opinions on this in an upcoming issue of our monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>Mark stated some accurate things in his post. Yes, sportsbooks know the difference between smart and dumb money, and yes, they release lines accordingly &#8211; to attract as much money as possible on BOTH sides. He is also right that &#8211; for the most part &#8211; it is the same people over and over again who are winning, and that SPECIALIZATION and ACCESS to INFORMATION is the key to success. The fact is &#8211; ANYONE can beat the sportsbooks, especially in baseball, college football and college basketball. The bottom line is most people don&#8217;t have the TIME to obtain the information they need to win, or develop a successful formula on their own. For the people who win consistently &#8211; it is a FULL TIME job. </p>
<p>It seems as though plugging is OK in this type of forum  – so for those of you interested in something similar to what Mark is talking about (it&#8217;s not a fund, but a private club – you place your own wagers) – check out the site below. It’s part of the ‘SMART money’ he’s referring to &#8211; the people who bet the same way over and over again. The system banks on the unpredictable – it ONLY plays underdogs and ONLY Money Lines. It&#8217;s a progressive system that&#8217;s worked steadily since its inception…<br />
<a href="http://www.profitlocksystem.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.profitlocksystem.com/</a> </p>
<p>Some specific comments:</p>
<p>#21 &#8211; Yes, the Palms has a sportsbook. No, they do not accept NBA wagers. The NBA is funny &#8211; one of the WNBA teams played it&#8217;s home games in a casino and they want to bring a franchise to Las Vegas (which is where the Warriors or Clippers should move, but that&#8217;s a separate issue) but like all other leagues they are forced to publicly &#8216;frown&#8217; on anything gaming related. This adds to the brilliance of Mark&#8217;s post from a hype-factor. He knew the papers would cover it and it would stir up controversy. </p>
<p>#40 &#8211; Nice. You get it. We’re on the quantitative side.</p>
<p>#86 &#8211; Good post. I can tell you bet. And you&#8217;re right &#8211; there is nothing more enjoyable than being the underdog and going after the house. Come join us!</p>
<p>#102 &#8211; Brilliant! This is an example of someone SO SURE of an outcome he posted it for everyone to see. He probably spent three hours researching why this game would go over the total. In doing so he proved our theory that picking isn’t easy. Wizards 95 &#8211; Nets 68&#8230; Total 163… way off…</p>
<p>#107 &#8211; Some good stuff here. But do the rest of you see what I&#8217;m talking about with the TIME component. The average busy executive doesn&#8217;t have time to do what this guy does. Skybox, we refer ATS services &#8211; I&#8217;d like to check yours out &#8211; what&#8217;s your web site address? </p>
<p>#108 &#8211; Of course Coke won&#8217;t go to zero &#8211; but the stock could drop $1.00. And if you invested 1,000 shares and had a stop-loss in place or sold it before it went back up &#8211; you LOSE money! Isn&#8217;t that the same as losing a $1,000 money-line bet? Yes, you could buy more shares, just as you could bet on the same team again in their next game and double your bet until they win/cover&#8230; And what book are you talking about that moves with a small bet? None of the top 50, that&#8217;s for sure. One thing you&#8217;re dead on about &#8211; I certainly believe you that in five years not one of your customers has made money &#8211; the public can&#8217;t pick ATS winners if their lives depended on it&#8230; Regarding your bet: I will bet you ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY – no kidding &#8211; that our 5-year returns will be positive. After our first full season offering our service to members we finished up 61,448 units in PROFIT. So far this season we&#8217;re up 19,165 (as of 11/30)&#8230; </p>
<p>#113 &#8211; Sports books don&#8217;t mind &#8216;smart money&#8217; it gives them balance and reduces their liability. And imagine a dozen or so $10k wagers per sport, every day, 365 days a year. That could produce some sizable returns&#8230; BTW, you don&#8217;t have to pay a 10% &#8216;vig&#8217; with Money Line bets. And you can make money at 30% if you play the underdogs and have the right money management system&#8230;</p>
<p>#123 &#8211; The key is FREQUENCY. There are money lines on 10 – 100 domestic events a day &#8211; even more on weekends &#8211; and even more when you factor in International sports&#8230; When you factor in sports in Europe, Australia and Asia, you could literally bet 24/7…</p>
<p>#132 &#8211; Some intelligent stuff here. People into sports betting should read this.</p>
<p>#133 – You’re close. Very close. Couple of things &#8211; yes there are &#8216;maximums&#8217; &#8211; as you put it &#8211; in sports. They&#8217;re called limits. So you must find the right unit level to STOP any given path of wagers. And secondly, it&#8217;s the opposite as you&#8217;ve stated  &#8211; you MUST use ONLY money lines, parlays, etc. (subsequent wagers must be at +110 or higher to achieve any kind of decent profits over the long haul). And you MUST bet on multiple things at once. Actually, the more the better. If we knew our members had unlimited bankroll we would release dozens more plays per day than we do. But there&#8217;s the practical element that not everyone has the same bankroll… </p>
<p>#136 &#8211; You need us too!</p>
<p>To conclude… another fine effort by Mark Cuban, the new hype-master. Thank you for giving us ‘little people’ the opportunity to share our thoughts in these reply posts…</p>

I have been a ProAm Gambler in the arena of sports for a long time. It started when I was a kid and I started to memorize sports stats. It isn&#8217;t an addiction although I am pretty good at Keno too. I don&#8217;t understand how that got started but growing up on an Indian Reservation can give you quick jump start. </p>
<p>Let me know &#8212; I am in the process of starting a &#8220;Sports Futures Blog&#8221; in which I will layout my predictions for future games. We&#8217;ll see how that goes maybe you will be interested. </p>

<p>I think this is an idea that has some merit.  As an internet thoroughbred handicpper I have enjoyed the racing profits for a while now.  I have worked with many clients in instructing them on how to create a constant cash flow using the horses.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just developed a system for automated timing of the horses that you should start to see nationally in the very near future.  Yep, another cash cow.  </p>
<p>I am now in the middle of setting up a computerized operation for handicapping.  My latest book on the subject has been turned into trial software and after a year of tweeking and successful testing it is being taken to the next level.  I am just a few servers away from going private and working with a few special clients.

		<p>So you want to run a hedge fund?  Well, you had better think outside of the box to separate yourself from the crowd (most hedge funds follow the crowd).  Very few people understand that when you trade in the markets or play a hand of poker you are looking for “tells” or being able to read human emotion or market psychology.  While it may be true that you cannot predict a company’s future balance sheets or a poker player’s hand, you most certainly can read the “tells” or patterns left by human psychology.  Whether poker, stocks, bonds, etc. we are playing people (i.e. emotion).  The market or the gambling games are just tools to play people.</p>
<p>The problem with hedge funds is that most hedge fund managers are novices and momentum players.  In other words, they follow the crowd.  For example, the majority of hedge funds have a net long position at market tops, including right now, this very moment in time.  As of now, the crowd is giving its “tells”, they are telling us all that they are confident that gold and the stock market (to name a couple) are going up?  Well, if everyone agrees, then they have all of their money (or cards) on the table, don’t they?  Who’s left to buy?  While the hedge funds are net long, the market is topping and is poised for a reversal.  This next week should be interesting and fun for those of us ready to go short…  (The crowd is more bullish now than at the 2000 top.)</p>
<p>Also, I would stay far away from bonds…  See, I don’t agree with the crowd on inflation?  (It’s funny how bulls and bears all think that we are going to see inflation?)</p>
<p>Define your edge, don’t be the crowd.  There are methods to read the patterns of human psychology, which have wonderful forecasting potential or to provide a very objective analysis.</p>
<p>Enough rant for today, back to the army/navy game…  (navy is killing army, 28-7)</p>

		<p>Mark, </p>
<p>Your article about starting a gambling hedgefund may be a publicity stunt, or it might be for real. Your facts about options trading on equities are true, Futures and options are derivative bets on the underlying and utilize a lot of leverage. The average person who takes these bets cannot hold the position if they go against them, or as with case with options expire worthless, as the time value of money premium erodes. Many hedgefund managers, including myself, will not touch Futures or Options, and consider them pure gambling bets, or &#8220;bucket shops.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liquidity and scalability also become a problem when you consider derivatives markets, like the options markets. If you are to make huge bets as a market participant, you might find that your size changes the odds or you will not find a market to match your position. If you own the casino, then liquidity is not an issue, and you make your money from the spread, and you can scale the size indefinitely.</p>
<p>You are right about inefficient markets. The market is NOT efficient, and all of these Efficient Market Theories that are taught in academia have and will continue to be proven wrong. Warren Buffett has said that if the market was efficient, he would be a beggar on the street with a tin cup. This is coming from the 2nd richest man, whom you consider is a &#8220;gambler&#8221; because he has made his money in the stock market by allocating capital to publicly traded companies, and exploiting market and valuation inefficiencies.  If you have an excel spreadsheet handy, plug in 28.6% return for 37 years, and compound that for the final number. For someone whom started at age 26 with 100 dollars in his LP (yes, Buffett started his career with a Limited Partnership, or what is now commonly referred to as a Hedgefund).  </p>
<p>I would encourage you to continue to exploit market inefficiencies, as you see them. I don&#8217;t know anyone else that sold a company to Yahoo for 2 billion dollars. That was a market inefficiency, and you were able to exploit it fully.</p>
<p>Owning a casino would be something you should look into. Just about 5 years ago, the Horseshoe had several bids for it, I think around 30 or 40MM. I could see what a bargain it was, even though it had a lot of debt, the intrinsic value was much greater. I think Harrah’s finally bought it. What a move that would have been for you to buy the Horseshoe, and take on the Benny Binion legacy, while poker and the WSOP grows in participation, publicity, and interest.</p>
<p>Another idea, you can start a Fund of Funds or (FOF), a Fund of Hedgefunds. You would then have the responsibility to research, scout out, and invest in the best money managers. It is very similar to running and owning an NBA basketball team. Who knows, maybe with your management style, leadership, and being in the public eye, you would be able to attract many large institutional investors, and grow a FOF into a 100BLN + venture, as well as discover the next &#8220;warren buffett&#8221;s and &#8220;george soros&#8221;s along the way.</p>

		<p>Hey Mark, You are right that most possible sports bets are stupid money (too close to call).  You&#8217;ll notice that most sports betting experts filter out 95% of the possible bets, which cover all popular sports.  Odds makers are excellent at their job, and the experts know that. They find the 5% of the bets that represent smart money, and ignore those possible bets that are too close to call.</p>

		<p>I like the basics of Mark&#8217;s idea and also have some  ideas of my own about how a sports hedge fund may work.<br />
     I am seriously considering investing 5,000 dollars or my whole life savings with a sportsbook.  I want to take that 5,000 and win 100 dollars with every cover.  So, my first bet would be for 100$.  If I lose that bet then I will bet 200$ plus lost juice in order to win 100$.  If I lose that bet then I have to bet 400.  If I lose that one then I have to bet 800 and if lose that one also then I&#8217;ll have one more 1600$ bet to take my bankroll to 5,100$.  The problem with this thinking is that eventually I will lose 5 bets in a row.  It could be after 68 wins without a five game losing streak.  The extra 6,800$ will give me an extra chance taking the total d day number to 6 straight loses.  However, if I was in a fund of 3 other like minded investors with a total bankroll of 20,000$ we could help each other out.  If one of us is on a losing streak it would be in the others best interest to help get the other out of the losing streak.  In our fund of four our main job would be to make sure none of us get into that type of trouble.  If we get into trouble early an individual and teammates could  never miss more than 7 picks in a row.  Once an individual misses 7 in a row he takes out his whole pod&#8217;s bankroll.  However, If we were part of a larger group, say Mark Cubans hedge fund then we could have an additional 6 straight losses before someone will have to make a million dollar bet.  But why would Mark Cuban make a million dollar bet to save one of his pods 5,000 dollar members?  Its easy, he would take a percentage of all members profits.  I have reviewed some peoples free picks and have found one individual who has never lost 5 bets in a row and has a total of 68 wins or under my system a net profit of 6,800$.  If Mark would take 10% of this individual profits it would net him a profit of 680$.  Now if you have 1,000 members in this hedge fund and on average they turn a profit of 2,500$ then you could take home 250,000 dollars.  The risk for Mark would be small since he has enough capital to keep betting till he wins.  Once he wins we all win and he isnt out a penny.  Maybe he raises the insurance on problem members so that they may have to pay 20% on profits.<br />
     As long as collectively as a whole we never miss 14 straight picks we would all make money.  At first its up to the individual pods to avoid 7 straight losses.  With 4 individuals working together profits will be easier to come by.  If a pod has missed 5 picks in a row they will have to bear down and come together to ensure a proper bet.  They would also have the support of surrounding NBA pods in the same hedge fund.<br />
     If anyone is interested in this idea I&#8217;d love to hear some feedback.</p>

		<p>The idea of using sports betting as a investment isn&#8217;t new.  But I think that nobody has had the resources to really start a hedge fund focused on this strategy.

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p>Interesting idea&#8230;like using the techniques employed by the MIT team against Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Knowing when the probabilities are on your side and then betting heavily can also be accomplished by observing the pricing inefficiencies between the index futures and spot market: place the long/short bet on index futures or ETFs.

<p>still.. i think that trading stocks based on chart patterns is a superior method of making money than sports betting.. because it&#8217;s like blackjack with a rule saying you can pull back 95% of your bet after seeing your cards and the dealer&#8217;s up card.</p>
<p>riding a losing investment into the ground is insane.  the price itself tells you if you were wrong or right.  i like to be proven right in a relatively short amount of time.  otherwise, bye bye.</p>

		<p>Obvisouly almost all of the people leaving comments here dont even know what HEDGE BETTING is.It doesnt matter who wins the spread&#8230;.you win regardless of outcome unless they tie the line then you push on both bets. you only win a small percent of money wagered say 2% but there&#8217;s oppourtunities to do this every week. hmm banks give at best 4% interest per year you can make this with 1 game. thats not too mention sign up bonuses and reload bonuses. </p>

		<p>My company develops exchange betting technologies, and closely partnered with a market leader in this domain. One of the things you should definitely arm your &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; hedge betting personnnel is with the tools they need to be competitive and efficient in seeking and monitoring the shifting opportunities that exist especially in highly volatile, liquid markets. Semi-automation coupled with domain expertise of your sportsbetting analysts should limit your liabilties nicely.</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t read through all the other postings but since the house is usually pretty accurate in predicting spreads &#8211; perhaps you should have a good amount of your fund gamble on gambling instruments called teasers where you change the odds to add 4 &#8211; 5pts for each bet but ofcourse the odds change.  Anyways just an idea.</p>

		<p>I truly love this idea and I actually have been doing this for some years now (always relatively small amounts of money) with good %&#8217;s returns. I started 2 months ago doing it with more serious money and only exposing myself to 1% of the AUM and am at the moment 5% YTD with very low volatility, which is above my personal target (of 2% monthly). I use mathematical models and I do spreads every time I can. I bet on every sport since its all mathematics (mainly soccer, tennis, snooker and horseracing)<br />
This is the job I truly want to do (at the moment am a senior analyst for a fund of hedge funds) but can&#8217;t find anybody that is actually doing it. I know that this idea didn&#8217;t go forward but does anybody have an insight on where and how can I find a job directly related to sports betting?<br />
Truly appreciate any feedback on this<br />
Sincerely</p>

		<p>Dear Mr. Cuban-</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a successful &#8220;Sharp&#8221; or professional sports gambler for the past year now. I was curious if you were still creating a hedge fund for gambling. I would to be a part of it in some way. You are exactly right about gambling. It&#8217;s really no different from the market. I use statistics and mathematics to make wagers and can give you me documented evidence of my success. Thanks and good luck today against the Spurs.</p>

		<p>Similarly, a sudden change in the futures vs fair value will have an effect on heavily traded stocks that can last as long as several minutes. And important developments at a particular company will most likely have an effect on the sister stocks in its sector that will a) not be immediately reflected in their stock prices and b) last for several hours, days, or even weeks. (What I’m suggesting with these last two points is that some stock market events are not independent of each other in the same fashion that you’d expect successive rolls of the die to be)</p>

		<p>Mark -<br />
Just came accross your blog about the hedge fund and am very interested in your fund idea, as I am building up some momentum myself to do the same thing (I am a successful 55-57% winner handicapper in the major sports over the past 8 years).  I know that the Books can be beaten, but, to be clear, that presupposes a proper money management system and alot of work handicapping &#8211; and neither is more important than the other !  And to be crystal clear, if anyone out there thinks that they can consistently do better than 55%-57% over the long-term, I would lay pretty heavy odds that you are either a tout or a liar.  There is no free lunch here and if you are willing to put in the time and the effort, and, no doubt just as important, exercise the strictest discipline in managing your money the right way, your ROI investing in the sports market will far exceed your average returns in any other endeavor, as you point out in your blog.</p>
<p>My primary question is the legality of it all &#8211; how the fund would be set up, where your operation would be run, etc.  As you know all too well, the Reg D Rules are pretty strict (e.g. sophisticated investors, fund size, etc), the SEC is cracking down on hedge funds, and we all know the current state of affairs in Washington with respect to wagering on sports.  That said, my sports investment  is by far my best investment and I, like you, would love to share that wealth but want to make sure that it would be totally, 100% legal.</p>
<p>If you have or are already doing the fund, I would love to be able to pick your brain on this a bit more.   </p>
<p>Congrats on the Mavs season this year.  I am not a Dallas resident (live in the Northeast), but my seven year old Peter is a huge Mavs fan (although he cried when you traded van exel)&#8230;&#8230;</p>

		<p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>I have been a professional in the commodity industry for over 36 years.  I have done many studies why people can not make money trading.  I have always heard that 85% of the people the invest loose money.  The reason is the same reason why Las Vegas does so well.  Taking a lost is against human nature.  It&#8217;s admitting failure.  So we don&#8217;t take that lost until it&#8217;s to big.</p>
<p>I now let the computer do the trading.  It&#8217;s programed to buy and sell according to a set of trading rules.  It only day trades.  It&#8217;s less stressful and more successful.</p>
<p>Now I enjoy the profits I always knew I deserved.</p>
<p>I enjoy your site and I enjoy your basketball more.</p>
<p>Good Luck Trading.  People usually need it.</p>

		<p>Wow, the amount of posts on here is incredible.<br />
While I am not sure whether you are serious or just going for dry wit regarding the state iof the stock market, but here&#8217;s what I had to say on <a href="http://thenats.blogspot.com/2004/12/fool-proof.html" rel="nofollow">http://thenats.blogspot.com/2004/12/fool-proof.html</a> when someone mentioned it to me (some of it was said tongue-in-cheek but I believe the theory is sound):</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br />
So, when Don Money asked me if Mark Cuban&#8217;s hedge fund for sports gambling would be something I would invest in, I needed to post my &#8220;if I only lived in Vegas&#8221; musings to answer fully.</p>
<p>Yes, DM, I would, but only if Mr. Cuban met with me for a few minutes first to discuss what I believe is a foolproof plan for sports gambling if you had the time and money.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps you may have heard of the doubling system in Blackjack. Essentially, that is a betting system that is &#8220;in theory&#8221; foolproof. What it requires is that you start off with a bet, let&#8217;s say $1. If you win, you put that $1 profit away, and you bet $1 again. Every time you lose, however, you double the bet&#8211;i.e., if you lose, you bet $2 next, then $4, then $8, etc. When you finally win a hand, you will have recouped your losses and actually won $1. You put that $1 profit away and start over.</p>
<p>The casinos know this, which is the reason that blackjack tables have maximum bets (you thought it was because they didn&#8217;t want you to lose more than $5000 at a time?). The maximum bet rule stops the doubling system because while you will definitely win a hand eventually, you may actually lose the 11 or so hands in a row it will take you to be more than $5000 down at a $5-$10 minimum table. If there was no such maximum, and you had a serious bankroll, you could make blackjack a career and never lose. With the maximum limit, you can lose and lose a lot.</p>
<p>Sports betting in Vegas is subject to no such maximums of which I know. Therefore, the doubling system should in theory be foolproof. The beauty of it is also that it doesn&#8217;t matter who you bet on, what sport, or what knowledge you have as long as you follow two important rules: 1) only bet on the 50-50 spread and over/under lines (as opposed to odds, parlays, money lines, etc.) and 2) do not bet on multiple things at once.</p>
<p>This works especially well during baseball season (for over/under run totals) [note: thenats.blogspot.com is obviously a DC baseball site] when there are multiple game starts throughout the day. Assuming you start on the first day of the season, figure about 190 days of baseball and about two-three segments of games (2pm eastern, 8pm eastern, 11pm eastern) each day, so you&#8217;d be making about 500 bets a season. Let&#8217;s assume $100 per bet, each win gets you a profit of $100 (I&#8217;m ignoring the percentages that the casino takes&#8211;you can adjust the bets accordingly to take this into account ($110 to win $100 the first time, $231 to win $210 the second time, etc.)). With 50-50 odds, you should win approximately 250 of the bets leading to a profit of $25,000.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t live in Vegas and I don&#8217;t have Mark Cuban&#8217;s bankroll. But, Mr. Cuban, if you use this strategy and add to your billions, I expect a small cut <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1305690953g' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

		<p>Undoubtedly you have the PERSONAL skills to make it happen.  You truly are a jack of all trades, master of many.  You know .com, you know business start-ups, you know derivatives well enough to structure your own hedge and school every engineer in GS Equity Derivatives, but hiring your talent for your gambling hedge fund is based on circular logic and unless the outcome is based on your personal skills, your returns will not be maximized and your venture won&#8217;t meet your expectations.</p>
<p>Just like you don&#8217;t need money to start a company (even when you were worth $500), relying solely on sweat equity, the very best don&#8217;t need your capital to make their own calculated bets.  So you are left with the supposed &#8220;smart money&#8221; that brags abouts their results and provides sub-par returns.  </p>

		<p>Hey, Mark,<br />
A friend directed me to this particular post (though I had read other dispatches from you in the past), and I have to say that your idea is one I&#8217;ve tried to draw my friends in on for quite sometime. See, I deal in pari-mutuel wagering (Thoroughbred racing mostly, but I&#8217;ve dabbled in harness and greyhound racing), and I think that with the right capital, the game is beatable&#8211;even with the 20% takeout rate. Horse racing offers Pick 4 and Pick 6 wagers whereby you pick the winners of X amount of race (four or six, respectively, in this case), and the payouts can be quite handsome&#8230; easily six figures in the pick six case. The risk is large, but the reward is ALWAYS worth it because if you pick your spots well, then I could easily see a $25,000 investment returning six figures. Even after taxes you&#8217;re still talking a 200% ROI. Anyway, I&#8217;d like to join your team as the pari-mutuel analyst.</p>

		<p>Financial goals.  Investment plan. Retirement planning.  Are you still with me Mr. Cuban?  Most people think the stock market is an easy method to make money.  Experience investors know that it takes a lot of hard work to find a company that is a great investment.  </p>
<p>D&#038;B reports, debt structuring, corporation legal entity studies, understanding of suppliers, customers&#8212;All this information is needed to find a solid investment.</p>
<p>A lot of people have taken a chance on the market and lost.  They followed a hot tip they picked up at last weekend’s cocktail party or tennis game, they invested in their brother-in-law’s company, or they bought into a company they believed in with all their heart.  Then they saw it fold, and now they figure once is enough.  That fear can be even harder to overcome than the fear that results from inexperience.</p>
<p>First, its important to note that each particular investment is subject to all the general risks that come with that type of investment.  For example, stock prices rise and fall with the stock market cycle, making stocks as an investment subject to market psychology risk.  If you buy stock, you inherit that cyclical economic risk.  Every bond or certificate of deposit presents some inflation risk, because a rising price level reduces the purchasing power of a fixed income.  If you buy any single bond you inherit the inflation risk that comes with all bonds.  </p>
<p>Remember the goal in investing is not to make millions or get rich over night; the goal is to get as far away from zero as you can over a given period of time.  You want to do it one penny at a time.  That mean’s staying away from hot new companies like Sears Holding (unless you are shorting it), and opting for companies with a proven track record like Heartland Express (HTLD).  </p>
<p>Are gambling and  stocks the same, yes!  If you gamble without understanding, then you are the same as an irresponsible investor.  If you learn how to card count then you are the same as a wise investor.  Stock is about the numbers at the end of the day.</p>
<p>At the end of the day there are a lot of ways the quality of a stock can be measure.  Don’t bother with looking at earnings.  Under the products and services that the business offers, its debt structure, and its competitors.  If you find yourself not understanding the company’s given industry, the product, or structure of debt, then buyer b-e-w-a-r-e. </p>
<p>Below are companies in which I have bought stock.  And, I plan to keep it that way for the next year.</p>
<p>Zimmer Holdings (ZMH)<br />
Marten Transport (MRTN)<br />
Heartland Express (HTLD)<br />
Kroger (KR)<br />
EADS NV (Paris: EAD)<br />
Metro AG (Frankfort: MEO)</p>

		<p>If you have the kind of money that you have, the previous poster is right. There is no reason to place bets when you can be the house. The reason for this is that you can gamble as the house by not trying to balance your books: You bias the line you offer the public in the direction that will get you money on the side you want to bet against and less money on the side you want to bet. Normally all you need to do is charge a fee to bet the side you don&#8217;t want them to, and give the public true odds on the other. In the meantime, you get everyone&#8217;s vig and most of the time you can get your real bets in without paying for them. There is at least one place I&#8217;m almost certain does this and does it well.</p>

		<p>Here are the main pros and cons of your idea.</p>
<p>The pros are that you are correct in assuming that the sports betting market is very inefficient in a number of ways.<br />
There are those that make better numbers than the bookmakers by using computer based stats mixed with injury reports and road trip reports.<br />
As an example the line may be Mavericks –4 and they predict that if the game were played a 1000 times the true line should be Mavericks –6 so they have an edge by betting on –4.<br />
They look at all results as a gaussian distribution with more positives than negatives.<br />
A good winning sports bettor (investor) will have a long term record of 55% winners Vs the spread.<br />
You need 52.38% winners Vs the –110 juice to breakeven.<br />
The beauty of the sports betting market is the ability to shop at different sportsbooks.<br />
In the above example most sportsbooks may offer Mavericks –4 but you may find a sportsbook that offers<br />
you –3.5. This means in the gaussian distribution of results, every time Mavericks win by 4, you win the game instead of push (tie) .<br />
Can you imagine a stock market that offers you prices on the same stock up to 5% cheaper!<br />
There is another area which is exploitable just as the stock market is.<br />
Arbitrage. You can arbitrage (scalp) lines across different sportsbooks.<br />
As an example in baseball you can often get +130 on one team and –125 on the other.<br />
This would give you a 0.98% ROI.<br />
Another form of arbitrage is the middle.<br />
Where one book offers you –6 on one NBA team and another book offers you +8 on the other.<br />
The favorite will win by 6, 7 or 8 enough to overcome the juice (commission).<br />
How do we know this is true? Quite a few other people and myself have vast databases of results and stat breakdowns, which tells us the estimate of the probability of a result happening.<br />
The above is very simplistic and only scratches at the surface of sportsbetting. There are a lot of methods and techniques that are not public knowledge for obvious reasons.<br />
The sharp bettors like to stay one step ahead of the bookmakers. They do not want them to plug up the inefficiencies.</p>
<p>The cons.</p>
<p>As a winning player you run into the problem of getting “backed off” from sportsbooks.<br />
Meaning if you win too much or they believe your action to be sharp they will close your account and ask you to leave. Just as a card counter in Vegas is asked not to play.<br />
The bigger the amount, the more trouble you will have getting down at the best prices.<br />
The stock market is a huge market compared to the sports betting market and can stand a lot more action.</p>
<p>Saying all that there are large syndicates out there who are already doing what you are proposing.</p>

		<p>Big, old-school, bookie-style sports books are dead.  Taking a 50-50 bet at -110 is the same as equity commissions were pre-Fidelity, pre-Etrade, pre-Schwab. The strongest point that Mark makes is that sports betting really isn&#8217;t that different than equity betting (aka &#8220;investing&#8221;). </p>
<p>Also, there is no reason sports betting markets should be seen as static investments. That&#8217;s like only being able to trade YHOO at open and at close.</p>
<p>Sports markets will evolve the same way that personal investor equity betting has evolved. There is absolutely no reason that a sports wager can not be traded dynamically, during the running of a game.  Some people may want to bail on a wager to recoup 10 cents on the dollar and some way to throw the dice on the longshot and buy a wager for 10 cents on the dollar.  Let the market work.</p>
<p>Tradesports and others are doing some of this with intra-game trading, but this is a whole new world.  When you see sports wagering as a market and not just as a 50-50 proposition bet, then I can imagine whole companies dedicated to it. And the scary thing is, that company looks a lot like a hedge fund: portfolio manager, cfo, game analysts, traders, and a whole boatload of quants.</p>

		<p>Mark Cuban has enough money to own a sports book. This would give him the opportunity to bet on a particular game (by shading the line slightly to attract money on the side he wants to bet against) and in effect get +110 on his wager rather than -110 if he was a bettor.</p>

		<p>I highly reccomend you investigate the business operations of casino companys such as Bodog, Party Poker, and Paridise. Paridise is a prime example, it was just bought out and could have been primed for the picking. These offshore ventures are far more profitable and easier to operate than traditional casinos, and with Mr. Cuban&#8217;s name and relationships this could possibly be his largest venture to date. Low overhead, 80% of the expense is marketing &#038; customer service&#8230; you have just got to love this formula!</p>
<p>Lets just consider low limit poker. According to the industry source &#8211; <a href="http://www.pokerpulse.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pokerpulse.com</a>, there has been $153,422,016 wagered online playing poker in the past 24 hours, with an estimated 1.3 million customers during the month of October. The house makes it&#8217;s money off the rake, at an average of $1.75 per hand played at each table, this equates to $2,530.00 per table per day. Lets now assume that Party Poker has on average 600 tables that collect rake. This is a gross revenue of 1.5 million per day, or 1/2 billion per year. Of course this does not include soponsorship fees or mercendising rights&#8230; but you can see this becomes a very profitable business whose overhead is probably less than 15% of Gross revenues.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuban&#8230; I think THIS is your future. Now that the WTOP has rules the US cannot prohibit it&#8217;s citizens from offshore gambling, perhaps its time to relocate to Antigua?</p>

		<p>My first impulse when reading this was that the NBA would have to look poorly (to put it mildly) upon such an operation.  Maybe if there were no sports bets being made by the fund, and certainly not any NBA bets it would be allowed by Stern et al.  But then I remembered the Maloofs.  Does the Palms have a sports book?  And if so do they take bets on the kings games?  I would imagine the answer to both of these questions are yes which brings up some interesting conflict of interest issues.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuban I&#8217;m curious how far you&#8217;re willing to go with this idea.  Would there be restrictions on the type of gambling or would anything suffice?</p>
<p>here&#8217;s a few ideas.  </p>
<p>Forming a team of poker players and paying their expenses, entry fees, etc&#8230; similar to what you already do with the Mavericks.   Essentially you would be running another team and then pooling and distributing winnings, while keeping a share for the owners.  this would almost be like a NASCAR team.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this would work well for a casino, the table games have too big of a house edge, and the only way to consistently beat them is to cheat.  And cheating gets you kicked out of casinos.  Hell just winning consistently would get you kicked out of a casino, so running some kind of scam similar to those MIT kids would probably not work.</p>
<p>Parimutual betting would present an intriguing possibility.  Bringing resources to bare on racing may make it possible to beat the system, i just don&#8217;t know enough about it.  The few people i know who were heavily into racing lost money, but as time went on they did seem to lose less of it, implying that they were at least learning something from the system.</p>
<p>Another interesting possibility would be betting on unusual things that you would have the power to influence.  e.g. betting on the presidential election and then working towards getting a particular candidate elected to collect the payoff.  With the resources at your command this would probably be feasible.</p>
<p>State lotteries and contest give aways might also be an opportunity.  I&#8217;m thinking specifically of Lazlo from Real Genius and the contests that he won, although that might be too small of a scale for an investor like you.</p>
<p>Anyways it&#8217;s an intriguing idea, thanks for giving me something to think about for 15 minutes.  Oh and thank you for the last several years of the mavericks, for this depressed bulls fan, they&#8217;ve certainly been a bright spot in the NBA.</p>

		<p>I have been gambling on sports since 1995.  Each and every year I usually profit.  My low was a profit of $16,000 and my high was a profit of $33,000.  I am very consistent in my money management which is just as important as picking the games.</p>
<p>I only rely on my own picks and feeling. Any gambler knows that to rely on someone elses picks is risky.  However, there are some outstanding cappers with excellent track records.</p>
<p>Sometimes I call or watch the tv for a man named Michael Cash Pomer located in the Toronto area.  This man is the most personable entertaining man ever.  He does charity work, and always promotes businesses in the area.  He is logical, realistic and fun.</p>

<p>Sports bettors regularly make money. All you have to do is be able to beat the conventional wisdom, which is often wrong. There was an article in my alumni magazine about an alumnus who was a professional gambler, and that&#8217;s what he did. He&#8217;s compute his own odds on sports games, and if his odds were better, he&#8217;d bet.</p>
<p>There are some syndicates that do this in Asian horse racing as well. </p>
<p>Second, check out <a href="http://www.marketocracy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.marketocracy.com</a>  (disclaimer, I work for them) you can start a virtual fund there with $1,000,000 of pretend money and see how you do.

<p>As a co-founder of a company that pioneered exchange betting around the world and has just launched the world&#8217;s first true peer-to-peer betting network, (www.betbug.com) I&#8217;ve spent many hours discussing the similarties between acquiring risk on sports, stocks, commodities, etc.  If you are interested in this sort of thing, you may wish to speak with Justin Wolfers, formerly of Stanford and now I believe at Wharton.  A professor at the MBA school, he&#8217;s the only guy I know who has officially recognized the similarties at such a high academic level.  I&#8217;ve corresponded with him a number of times and he&#8217;s very approachable.</p>
<p>You might also be interested to know that our company was the first to do Monte Carlo modeling and build sophisticated market making tools for sports betting exchanges.</p>

<p>It seems like this would be similiar to other hedge funds but a slightly different focus.  It would be highly profitable if the team worked very hard, did lots of research and occassionally got lucky.  I think you should go for it.  I also think that the NFL is the easiest target.  I have picked over 60% verse the spreadthe last 6 years and I don&#8217;t think I have any extra special system.</p>

		<p>Response to Greg Martin&#8217;s post,</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there is no system in existence that achieves 100% profitability (after inflation and taxes, that is) over any given time period. I find it difficult to believe that your quantitative trading system can deliver as promised when implemented in a real-time trading environment (i.e, not back-tested). However, there are a number of quantitatively-oriented hedge funds that have performed spectacularly well over multiyear periods: Renaissance Technologies, SAC Capital, Paloma Partners, DE Shaw and Atlas Fund all come to mind (along with the proprietary trading desks at Goldman &#038; Lehman). AlphaSimplex Group, run by MIT professor Andrew Lo, is another interesting shop. In any case, I would subject the model to rigorous stress testing, etc. If you can truly prove the model&#8217;s utility through an actual performance record, then I would approach a number of these and other money managers. If you plan to distribute the system on a mass retail scale and are successful, then the model has to be dynamic and &#8220;intelligent&#8221; enough to overcome the inevitable performance degradation that accompanies widespread use (in other words, the  trades recommended by the model may become too crowded if a lot of people utilize it). The same outcome applies to hedge funds and institutional money as well: many hedge funds are short the dollar, short tech, and are mostly crowded into the exact same trades, names, etc. This groupthink has resulted in most funds posting YTD performance numbers that are downright embarrassing. Just because common sense, academic theory and/or market precedent dictate that a security should be priced at $X doesn&#8217;t mean that it will trade for $X. Good luck.</p>

<p>November 26, 2004 </p>
<p>PEOPLE WHO GAMBLE FOR MONEY ARE POTENTIAL CHEATERS BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING.</p>
<p>Anyone who risks his or her wealth upon the fickle whims of chance is usually not the type of person you would like to have for a business partner. They are individuals who are most likely to yield to the temptation to cut corners on product quality, overlook unsafe working conditions, and generally fail to deliver on their promises. It is impossible to get something for nothing for a sustained period of time. The law of compensation is unforgiving in its demands that you get what you deserve. You may feel at times that you deserve better-and you may-but eventually your payback will be commensurate with your efforts. </p>

		<p>Mark &#8211; Every action in life is a gamble (not just investing), but most of our actions are gambling choices we make subconsciously everyday. </p>
<p>I always get a kick out of folks who say that they are not risk takers, yet as an example many are too lazy to check their car&#8217;s tire pressure at regular intervals for instance (if ever at all).  Heck just getting in your car and driving is a quantitative and qualitative risk &#8211; most just don&#8217;t realize that they&#8217;re betting something really valuable right then and there.  They don&#8217;t even think about the risk of car trouble, or wrecks or god forbid injury or whatever because &#8220;the odds are it will not happen to me&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Life is full of hedges, but living it makes it work the risks we rarely realize we&#8217;re taking.  When people open their eyes and see just how often they gamble what they take for granted each and every day, they&#8217;d look at your little crafty hedge idea and say .. hmm that&#8217;s not such a big risk afterall.</p>

<p>to make this venture worthwhile, you have to have the same characteristics of a sucessfull hedge fund &#8211; namely, have an &#8220;edge&#8221;, or be able to absorb risk premiums from various markets. i believe as certain hf strategies lose their returns due to capital constraints/competition (think declining returns for merger arb), you will find a number of new alternative strategies to diversify for the endless appetites of fofunds.</p>
<p>i work as a quant, and there are a number of parallels with investing/trading where you can find this edge in sports betting.</p>
<p>fundamental &#8211; ie you know more than anyone about biotech stocks or UNC-Charlotte basketball, etc.  you know that the star point guard has the flu, went out drinking last night, etc.  this is simply being more informed (almost like information arb) than anyone else.</p>
<p>quantitative &#8211; build perdictive models and/or arb.  ie what statistics are important to the line? an associate and i use an arb model sucessfully, but not in the traditional arb where you arb the lines between differrent sportsbooks&#8230;</p>
<p>behavioral &#8211; realize there are psychological tendancies of the human brain &#8211; ie failure to emphasize one event and over-extrapolating a series of events&#8230;</p>

<p>RE: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE</p>
<p>Dear All:</p>
<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>In 1977, Kaplan Education LTD was sued by the Federal Trade Commission at Federal Trade Commission v. Kaplan Education, LTD, et al, 433 F. Supp. 989, *; 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15398, **; 1977-2 Trade Cas (CCH) P61, 541, for false, misleading, and deceptive representations. Thereafter, the company was sold to the Washington Post Company (NYSE: WPO) and now operates as Kaplan, Inc., Kaplan Higher Education Corporation, Kaplan University, Kaplan College, Concord University School of Law, Kaplan Educational Center, Inc., and other.   </p>
<p>Of particular interest to my issue is Concord University School of Law, the first online law school approved as a degree-granting institution by the State of California, Bureau of Private Postsecondary and Vocation Education. It is registered as a correspondence school with the State Bar of California. Interesting however, according to correspondence I received in 2003 from John W. Barth, Director, United States Department of Education, Office of Post Secondary Education, in 2000/2001 when I enrolled, the law school didnâ€™t have authority to grant a Juris Doctorate degree. In short, Kaplan, Inc.â€™s ownership of a tiny 500 student school/campus (Kaplan College, Davenport, Iowa) in 2000/2001 was Concordâ€™s only means and legal authority to grant postsecondary degrees.</p>
<p>Students who earned a Juris Doctorate degree from a correspondence law school registered with the State Bar of California are eligible to sit for the California General Bar Exam. And, once a graduate receives a California license he becomes subject to the reciprocity rules for state license in the other jurisdictions. The online law school is required by its regulators to keep copies of all academic files in its administrative offices.</p>
<p>II. MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF THE FIRST ONLINE LAW SCHOOL</p>
<p>I am an African American living in Pennsylvania. In 2000, I made application to Kaplan College (Concord School of Law), scored 14 of 15 correct on the entrance examination, passed the â€œpsychological testing,â€ and was advised by Mathew McClenahan, Director of Enrollment, that I was accepted as a 2000 â€œthird-yearâ€ transfer. </p>
<p>However, a week or two later, representatives from the law school started expressing an unusual concern about my race and ethnicity. Although I had refused to provide the information on my application, school representatives now were asking bizarre questions: â€œYour surname is German, but your wife sounds black?â€ â€œWhat race are your kids?â€ So we told them weâ€™re black. And, almost immediately, Mr. McClenahan would announce, â€œThe administration changed its mind about your enrollment, your race (African American) doesnâ€™t fit the planned demographic for the inaugural group of students.â€ </p>
<p>We complained and hired a Pittsburgh attorney. The attorneyâ€™s evaluation of the situation is well documented. But, nonetheless, the issue appeared to quickly resolve itself. Mr. McClenahan would later call, apologize, and although it was too late for a 2000 enrollment offer a January 2001 start. </p>
<p>January 2001 arrived, but Concord didnâ€™t communicate any additional information, and/or grant me access to their online campus. I guess they were hoping I would somehow go away. So I complained again in writing. This time, Mr. McClenahan resolved things by explaining â€œthings were delayedâ€ because he had to rush together a â€œthird-yearâ€ program for my enrollment. He added: â€œWe didnâ€™t have any â€˜third-yearâ€™ courses.â€ In short, Mr. McClenahan said he â€œcombined â€˜second-yearâ€™ electives with a new â€˜third-yearâ€™ evidence courseâ€ he rushed together (created just for my enrollment).</p>
<p>I did start in the second or third week of January 2001. A few weeks behind, I was excited and wanted to immediately get involved with my new law school and course work. Unfortunately, I would soon discovered that the online law school didnâ€™t have a â€œhighly interactiveâ€ campus, with the 600 to 1000 students, as advertised. In fact, I could find no more than 25 to 30 â€œfirstâ€ and â€œsecondâ€ year students. In addition,  there were no â€œprofessor-led group chatsâ€ and no â€œchat archivesâ€ to memorialize actual participation. I was only online with nothing to do. I immediately wrote the administration. Mr. McClenahan, in response on January 18, 2001, wrote: â€œI have the answer to the situation, however, I will need another day or two to implement.â€ </p>
<p>However, the problems didnâ€™t get corrected. Mr. McClenahan did eventually facilitated access to â€œsecond-yearâ€ chats, but explained that there wasnâ€™t any â€œthird-yearâ€ evidence chats and no â€œchat archives.â€ He reminded me that there wasnâ€™t a â€œthird-yearâ€ program. To curb my enthusiasm,  almost immediately thereafter, I received an unannounced â€œpopâ€ quiz in the â€œthird-yearâ€ evidence course. Such appeared strange because there really wasnâ€™t any assignments to be tested on. Nonetheless, I scored 8 out of 10 correct.</p>
<p>A couple more weeks, maybe a month, had passed before the first actual group classroom activity. Because there wasnâ€™t a â€œthird-yearâ€ program, â€œprofessor-ledâ€ group chats were limited to constitutional law, civil procedure, and criminal procedure. What Mr. McClenahan said were â€œsecond year electives.â€ During the group chats we covered material in a hasty superficial manner. Students were permitted to submitted comments to online professors who screened any and all student  information before it was posted for others to view. But in all the activity served more as only an introduction to one or two cases, and maybe a quick 20 minute â€œrush throughâ€ of the remaining material. Other than that there was nothing more to the first online law school. </p>
<p>Yes we were required to read the material on our own, take a quiz or do a writing assignment every other month, and submit the materials to the administration for grading. But quickly I noticed that anything I submitted, course questions and the like (to the alleged assigned professors), were in fact always answered by the administrative office. It appeared there was one person at the California administrative office who did everything (grade assignments, correspond with students, and the like). </p>
<p>Needing more, I began researching the assigned material and cases on my own. That is, I looked beyond the text books, beyond the uninhibited online campus, to the actual cases (and treatment given by the appellate courts). I began approaching the material in a manner similar to how students at the â€œbricks and mortarâ€ law schools research the law. Such did helped me acquire a better understanding of things. But, the school administration didnâ€™t appear receptive. That is, I received very bizarre comments from the administration, â€œItâ€™s</p>

		<p>Your assumptions of the similarities and differences between the stock market and gambling arenas are extremely interesting, but I believe you eluded to the fact that unlike sports, some business have a business model relatively more solid than any sporting franchise or card game (with the possible exception of maybe the hated Yankees), that will constantly prove a stream of cash flow that is unlikely to dry up.</p>
<p>There are possibly a handful of companies that have and will maintain their performance and are far more capable and stable the a government is in terms of payment and have the ability to react to monetarily to any political situation (again unlike any government).</p>
<p>It is agreed that accounting magic can create a penny here and there, but as we should know, like most sports teams, a good track record should be shown before even bothering to be enticed into believing certain managements. Would a free agent join the mavericks before you came along?</p>
<p>Hence to sum it up, betting on managements of good companies with strong cash flows is still better than odds at any casino, (and they do kick card counters out, so there goes your blackjack run) will offer.</p>

		<p>Hi Mark!</p>
<p>Congratulations on a terrific idea (however I did think of this years ago owning a Hedge Fund company myself).  There are various problems and legal issues you will have to wrangle with, and I&#8217;m not sure you will pursue this dream after you see all the roadblocks in the way.</p>
<p>Regarding people telling you their betting theories, I just have to laugh.  I&#8217;ve been betting for 10 years, and make a living at it.  For the people that come up with the &#8220;doubling&#8221; theory (like poster above here), I can only think one thing&#8230;&#8221;amateur&#8221;.  Any professional gambler knows that statistical anomolies will occur (where you will win 15 in a row, but  might lose 10 in a row).  It&#8217;s not very pragmatic to bet $32000 just to win $100.  A real professional gambler bets instinctively and changes his bets according to how confident he is with a likely outcome, not on emotion or desperation of trying to win money back.  </p>
<p>P.S.  Take the Lakers (+5) at home tonight vs. Phoenix&#8230;.Lakers should win outright.</p>

This is a very interesting idea.<br />
I currently work in financial industry on the quantitative side of the business and ideas similar to this have crossed my mind. With the development of such market makers as Tradesports.com this seems like a natural evolution.<br />
As mentioned in #31 and #79, Justin Wolfers at Wharton may be someone worth speaking with. I recently saw his presentation on &#8220;Prediction Markets&#8221; and found it very informative.<br />
Here is the link to his whitepaper.<br />

		<p>Hello Mark, if you&#8217;re truly serious about the fund, please count me in.

Jay here again&#8230;..and I&#8217;d like to address this response to the readers of this post.<br />
I personally have lost thousands of dollars in the Stock Market, but have since turned it around in the sports investment industry.<br />
Our site, wicked-picks.com, has consistently rewarded our members with winning picks as we have an almost non-existent turnover of memberships.<br />
See our most recent results for proof: <a href="http://www.wicked-picks.com/content/performance" rel="nofollow">http://www.wicked-picks.com/content/performance</a><br />
There are so-called &#8220;experts&#8221; out there that are legit and make tons of money with their picks&#8230;we know&#8230;we use them ourselves.<br />
I just have to agree with Mark on the concept that, if done properly, a sports betting hedge fund can(should) be more profitable and contain less risk than playing against Wall Street.<br />
I hope you can do this Mark and wish you and everyone else the very best of luck.</p>

		<p>cuban, cuban, cuban. i know this isn&#8217;t part of the subject you&#8217;re talking about up there, but i just can&#8217;t stop thinking about it. it&#8217;s been over 6 months, and I can&#8217;t forget about steve nash. On nov. 16th, I heard that you never said one word to Steve. What, you&#8217;re not chicken are you? i never thought so. On Feb. 26th, go up, say hi, how are you, etc. I&#8217;m still kinda upset that you didn&#8217;t want to resign him. The mavs would&#8217;ve been alot better this year if he was still there. Look at him now. He&#8217;s led the Phoenix Suns to places I haven&#8217;t seen in a while. This season is having a slow start. The only person leading here is Dirk. He can&#8217;t be the only one to lead in points. You need someone who&#8217;s good! And oh yeah, don&#8217;t trade Jerry Stackhouse. I personally met him at the women&#8217;s basketball 101. I didn&#8217;t really talk to him, but he seemed really friendly. He even called me a shorty!! Which I am&#8230;hehe, and when I see him on the court, he plays really well, and I just hope you don&#8217;t trade him. He&#8217;s awesome. I also prefer you keep Devin Harris. I can see a good future. He might even be as great as Nash someday&#8230;ooo you better keep him!!</p>

		<p>The tax ramifications of this are horrible, worse than a &#8220;regular&#8221; hedge fund.  Gambling losses are not deductible in full against gambling income (because of itemized deduction phaseouts), so even if the fund breaks even the investors will owe income tax.  If the fund loses money, there is no deduction for the loss.  Another problem is that, at least under GA law, it would be a criminal act to even participate in such a fund.</p>

		<p>Mr. Cuban </p>
<p>Congratulations on the brilliant idea, which I would like to help you implement.  I am a securities lawyer with a prominent New York firm and a CFA canadidate and I am proposing a working relationship that won&#8217;t cost you a cent until you see some value added (details upon request, but it sure beats $425/hour).  Having bantered with colleagues and investment bankers about similar ideas over the last few years, I maintain that, as good capitalists, we have a RESPONSIBILITY to exploit market inefficiencies through arbitrage, and the sports gambling business is ripe for this evolution.</p>
<p>I know about market inefficiency: (a) I am up 300% this basketball season, having bet on at least one Atlantic division game almost every day, usually parlaying the over/under with the spread and (b) hours and hours of work on my &#8220;legitimate&#8221; investments have earned me a paltry 24% combined return over the last three years (admittedly on a less risky portfolio than my gambling interests would indicate).</p>
<p>I also know about the law: (a) assuming we plan to fit into Regulation D, and assuming the fund won&#8217;t be an eligible investment for most institutions, we will need to sell this to private people earning over $200k, notwithstanding that these people will automatically ascribe a high level of risk to the fund based solely on shock value (in reality, there is little more risk than conventional investments, as other posters and you have demonstrated, which is a point we will have to sell) and (b) we may run into a public policy issue regarding the legality and palatability of non-individuals (i.e. trusts or corporations) placing bets &#8211; I have an idea to overcome this.</p>
<p>I believe we can sell this but it will take months of legal and economic planning plus some serious financial modelling before even attempting to actually sell this thing.  I have a lot more to say, but I don&#8217;t care to post it for the entire world to read.  I believe we can reasonably project real economic profits for several years, until regulators catch up with the market (e.g. when this business is so pervasive that regulators realize that sports betting guides ought to be governed by GAAP-type financial principles and SEC-type disclosure principles, only then will our &#8220;growth phase&#8221; likely have concluded).  In fact, I expect that the fund will be so successful as to eventually raise a very significant non-legal issue &#8211; who, even in Vegas, has a gambling book large enough to consistently take bets valued in the 9-figure range, particularly when the bettor tends to win a lot more often than it loses.  We will cross that bridge when we come to it.</p>
<p>Bottom line:  I will soon be in this business one way or the other but I would rather do it with you rather than go head to head with a proven winner.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

		<p>For all these double up theories, I am willing to bet you won&#8217;t last 1 month using this theory. There is no guaranteed to win play. You will see 10-15 game winnning streaks and losing steaks. You would be better off betting $1 and doubling every time that you won. Have you ever heard that you only have to double $1 twenty times to have 1 million dollars. If you do gain a statistical advantage, you are better off wagering the same on every game and grinding out profits. It does take about 53% winners just to break even. A solid handicapper can hit between 55%-62%. If you hear a someone on the radio saying the hit in the 75% range, they are either flat out lying or they are telling you that they went 3-1 on there last 4 plays. 75% in a short amount of time is not impossible. I am a firm believer in wageriing a lesser amout on more games. I have written a spreadsheet that uses the same factors on all games and usually comes up with 12-20 NCAA Football games per week. A similar spreadsheet for the NFL comes up with 3-6 plays per week. The spreadsheet has won 60% consistently over the past 5 seasons. I have shown profits in the range of 50-65 units per season. Since I use and recommend a &#8220;flat&#8221; bet system, I wager 1 unit per game. You will see alot of handicappers that have a star or rating system. Let&#8217;s say that they have 3 plays for any given day. For example, lets says that they rate their plays 1,3, and 5 stars. They hit 2 out of 3 games but their Top play loses.</p>
<p> (ex.(4 x 100) &#8211; (5 x (-110)= -150)</p>
<p> So they managed a winning record and still lost money. I on the same hand going 2-1 generated you +.9 units.</p>
<p> (ex. (2 x 100)- (1 x -110) = 90)</p>
<p>Great idea Mark and you are right, an edge can be found.</p>

		<p>Had a similar idea a few years ago, but I was thinking bigger.  Mutual fund instead of a hedge fund.  I realize now that a hedge fund is a much better idea.  You would probably have to take it overseas, no way DOJ or SEC would allow it in the US.  Hire only statistions and math geeks to write complex computer programs. Biggest advantage I see is the arbitrage opportunity, you could make a killing here.  Largest obsticle (except for the legality and conflict of intererst issues, which are obvious) is that you would be a market marker.  These bets would swing he entire gambling market and move the point spread SIGNIFICANTLY.  What I am trying to say is, no one is going to take the bet.  Anyway, good luck.  I think the US is probably about 5-10 years away from this idea&#8230;..Personally, I think you are just pissed off at corporate American and their reporting practices.  Remember it is the lawyers who make the reporting laws, corporate management just works with what they have.</p>

		<p>Fantastic blog. For years I have agreed with Mr. Cuban&#8217;s assessment that Wall St. is just a form of legalized gambling, especially with the advent of online trading over the past decade. How are my positions in Lucent, Urban Outfitters and Open TV different than my opinions on the Atlanta Falcons or  the Buffalo/Cleveland over?<br />
Even more intriguing is the concept of sports betting being an investment tool. For over twenty consecutive years the Boston Herald&#8217;s IM Bettor has posted a winning season in football. Consistently technically savvy handicappers like Big Al McMordie, Mike Orkin, and Donnie Black have also posted varifiable profitable years, how is this possible? A consistent and disiplined money management program coupled with extensive analysis and an understanding of the marketplace psychology will produce results. This is the exact same mantra of Investment Gurus. Opportunities abound whether it be Patriot League basketball, Sun Belt Conferance football, or the over 5,000 Major League baseball games a year &#8211; not to mention athletic contests outside of the US. It&#8217;s all about working the information at your fingertips, being patient finding a favorable play and exploiting it.<br />
My only question is will the amount of money wager placed be accepted? Unlike the Stock Market sports books can limit the amount of action accepted. Not every book will have the same line, and obviously due diligence must be followed as every half point, or percentage of vig is precious.<br />
Mr. Cuban the idea and it&#8217;s non prejudiced, forward thinking is spectacular. Should you be looking for any kind of help on this venture now or in the future, I would love to be a part of this project in any capacity.</p>

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p>I have run a hedge fund for 3 years now and worked for 2 prior.  I would be interested in chatting and sharing ideas if you care.  There are several questions that I am curious about.  Who would act as a prime broker to custody assets and act as your official books and records.  People get very funny when they can not check to make sure their money is still there.  What type of investor communication/transparency are you looking to provide and what type of risk management techniques are you looking to employ.  Lastly aren&#8217;t there any restrictions related to sports betting that you may be restricted on (the thought of Pete Rose comes to mind).  You have a very interesting idea.  Mail me and we may be able to teach each other something.</p>

<p>&#8230;..Beckford&#8217;s Fraud<br />
6. Beckford gambled with investor money, traded outside of the Fund&#8217;s objectives, and paid himself money to which he was not entitled, resulting in investor losses of $4,828,129.</p>
<p>7. Beckford started gambling with investor money in February 2001. Beckford used the Fund&#8217;s money for gambling activities in Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas, and Henderson, Nevada, at horseracing tracks and off-track betting parlors around the country, and on sporting events over the internet. For example, on December 17, 2002, February 7, 2003, and March 7, 2003, Beckford wired $150,000, $243,000, and $307,000, respectively, to the Bellagio Hotel Casino in Las Vegas from Fanam&#8217;s brokerage account. Beckford lost the majority of the money sent to the Bellagio by gambling at its casino and on its sports book, and he lost some of the remaining money gambling at other casinos. Beckford also used Fanam&#8217;s money to finance his gambling trips. Investors paid for Beckford&#8217;s airfare, rental cars, and hotel rooms. In total, Beckford lost $776,344 of investor money through his gambling losses and travel expenses&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to interview with you back in the early days of audionet. My company was looking to advertise and we were considering spending our ad money with you. After talking, listening and agreeing with you and your visions (and you offering me the chance to join audionet) I made a tough choice and declined your offer. I have regretted my decision ever since my old boss decided &#8220;web site e-commerce was not the future&#8221; in 1998 and closed our company. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read your blog (and many of the responses here) and fully believe this would work, be profitable and attract investors. Let me know when you are accepting resume&#8217;s. I want an employee number in the low teens this time around. </p>

		<p>I actually flirted with this idea about a year ago.  I did some research and found a bunch of software companies who were pitching programs that claimed to identify arbitrage opportunities.  It looks like the biggest problem is that the size, or lack therof, of the overall market limits the abililty to make large profits on any one trade and therefor puts a cap on what any one individual can earn.  The companies pitching the arbitrage software were doing so because they could&#8217;t solve the problem of how to make one person working full time earn much more than 60,000 per year.  I am guessing that this wasn&#8217;t enough per capita to cover the operating costs and a resonable profit margin to run a full time arbitrage fund.  They probably found it a better strategy to empower lots of individuals and to create a reoccuring annuity.  Which I would say they probably are doing quite effectively especially as you can only buy the software with a license that renews annually.</p>
<p>I guess If you can address that problem you will have it made.  Interestingly enough this is almost the same problem that any successful hedge fund runs into.  Once their capital gets big enough they become to big for a lot of the very profitable opportunites.  They all end up either disbanding or trying to leverage things on a macro scale like the currency speculations,etc&#8230; that we see many of the big funds dabbling in.</p>
<p>my 2 cents&#8230;</p>

		<p>Main problems, Limits on wagers, and line movements off smart money. . Making large enough wagers into soft or bad numbers to run a hedge fund will be impossible. Sure you can get down big on nfl football after the openers have been beat up but by then the potential for value is small. Other sports have smaller limits and casinos will move the lines when the sharp money comes in.  You will need a special arrangement with the books to get this oof the ground.  In theory it is a great way to make money as sports wagering does present great investment  potential to the sharps its just that applying that to the hedge fund model does not work in the current las vegas enviroment</p>

		<p>Sorry, but this just won&#8217;t work in a size large enough to have a decent-sized fund.<br />
Betting limits are low compared to the stock market, and even if you &#8220;spread the action around&#8221; (i.e. Vegas, the islands, Europe, Australia), each sportsbook watches the line moves at other books, with many adjusting their numbers to stay in line with the major books.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if one could bet large enough to generate a positive return, this would only last for a short time.Here&#8217;s why:<br />
Several years ago a group of sharp bettors took the &#8220;edge&#8221; from the casinos on totals wagers (over/under bets). The casinos responded by lowering the limits to $300 and then many would only take totals wagers in parlays until the edge was recovered.<br />
So, what&#8217;s going to happen with this &#8220;fund&#8221; is that it will generate profits, but they will be relatively small and increasingly diminishing.</p>
<p>As a resident of Las Vegas and a bettor for many years I have had the opportunity to watch the sportsbooks adjust. They simply won&#8217;t allow you to win millions for very long.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s assume you treat this as a market like Tradesports. Well, I&#8217;m sorry Mark, but that&#8217;s just plainly illegal as it involves interstate gambling activity. The Wire Act and many associated cases have clearly established the illegality of this. I have the case law.You can&#8217;t even legally place an offshore bet from Las Vegas! Basically, the cases establish that &#8220;if it looks like gambling, no matter how well disguised, then it IS gambling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Going further, what I&#8217;m saying is that Tradesports and every other betting site, whether person-to-person or otherwise, is violating US law.<br />
 So, why not take the operation offshore? Well, the law clearly establishes the US maintains jurisdiction over it&#8217;s citizens anywhere in the world.<br />
Consequently, you are left with establishing an offshore fund that only places bets in jurisdictions where sports betting is legal, and doesn&#8217;t accept or place wagers (or whatever you&#8217;d like to call them) from/ to any US location. It just seems too difficult.</p>
<p>Even if you set up the fund in Nevada, the actual placing of wagers would seem to involve &#8220;messenger betting&#8221; in violation of Nevada statutes.<br />
Finally, even if you manage to overcome all this, there are tax problems. It is likely that the expenses associated with this &#8220;business&#8221; are not deductible. I believe there is a US Supreme Ct precedent, but don&#8217;t hold me to that one.<br />
Now, to each individual&#8217;s personal return:<br />
Gambling winning go directly to the income side, while gambling losses are only deductible as itemized expenses. I find it difficult to believe you can treat this operation as an LLC or other entity for federal income tax purposes, issuing a K-1 to each fund participant. I don&#8217;t think the IRS will buy this<br />
being treated as a business.</p>

		<p>As a professional poker player, I can definitely tell you that backing in poker is the only way most of us can afford to play the tournament trail.  To play all the events at the World Series of Poker this year would cost just over $125k.  And all the major tournaments for the year, you&#8217;re looking at over $600k&#8230; </p>
<p>But if you or anyone else is serious about wanting to back some poker players, I&#8217;ve got a crew with a pretty good playing record.</p>

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p>Although I follow your logic, you seem to forget that the &#8220;smart money&#8221; in the stock market doesn&#8217;t trade day-to-day and attempt to exploit the &#8220;inneficiencies&#8221; you speak of.  If you diversify and hold for the long-term you&#8217;re going to make about 10% on your money.  Look at any long-term period in the stock market in general and that&#8217;s what you get.  </p>
<p>Diversify and play your money for the long-term in Vegas and you lose every time.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong.  I enjoy the thrill of looking for inefficiencies in the stock market and the thrill of gambling in Las Vegas, but I consider them both recreational.</p>
<p>Well, if you actually read through this, I would appreciate a response.  I&#8217;m involved in a startup right now and would love to get your input.</p>

		<p>Mark, I believe your hedge fund would be an excellent way for people to take a real risk and get an almost immediate return or loss. Which ever way the dice rolls. I have been hearing so many good things about you. The way that you conduct business is awesome. I work for a company that deals mainly with the racing industry. This company wants me to manage all of their out of state stores, because they told me they have never had anyone work as hard as me. The only thing I am having a problem with is that they want me to put a plan together for the next two years, but they are not allowing me the time or assets I need to put it together. When they approached me with the offer I said, Yes. I would have no problem with this except they with will not let me research any of the profit and losses of the stores, because I have to do my normal job which is recieving and pulling very large parts orders. What would you recommend I ask from them so that I could put a plan together. Thank you very much for any advice given.<br />

		<p>This product is interesting and the debate could go on and on.  From an academic standpoint, I&#8217;m sure there are lots of quantitative methods that could be proven or just simply applied through various types of analytical software.  However, this is probably a capacity constrained product with high risk due to the diversification parameters.  Regardless of the &#8220;hedging&#8221;, there is still risk with respect to unknown correlations and also human factors (player injury, illness, personal problems, or other non-statistical factors).  How does one match the qualitative and quantitative attributes to mitigate the standard deviation?  I just don&#8217;t see institutional interest in this type of product.  It sounds very academic and not very practical for generating a profit, however, it does sound like a &#8220;fun project&#8221;.</p>

		<p>There is a difference between Vegas and Wall Street.  Gambling is, at best, a zero sum game; for every winner there is a loser.  OTOH, companies use money they get from the sale of stock to build new products and industries, essentially making value from (almost) nothing.  In the stock market everyone can (in theory) win whereas a bet requires a loser.  </p>
<p>People only lose money in the stock market for two reasons: greed and stupidity.  Just by using your head and tempering your lust for money, you can find safe investments that get you decent returns.  It&#8217;s only when you let temptation compels you to invest in a company with shady finances or one you know little about that you start taking real risks.  </p>
<p>Of course, what do I know, I&#8217;m not the one that owns the Dallas Mavericks and has enough free cash flow to start a hedge fund on the side!  <img src='http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1305690953g' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

		<p>Your&#8217;re so right that Wall Street is the largest casino in the world. There is no question about it. Nicholas Darvas wrote a book called Wall Street:  The Other Las Vegas. This book was written in the 1960s and to this day Wall Street continues as a legal casino filled with dealers and the so called anal yeasts &#8220;analysts&#8221;. I believe that when these so called &#8220;analysts&#8221; upgrade and downgrade a stock there is an alternative motive to it.</p>

		<p>Your&#8217;re so right that Wall Street is the largest casino in the world. There is no question about it. Nicholas Darvas wrote a book called Wall Street:  The Other Las Vegas. This book was written in the 1960s and to this day Wall Street continues as a legal casino filled with dealers and the so called anal yeasts &#8220;analysts&#8221;. I believe that when these so called &#8220;analysts&#8221; upgrade and downgrade a stock there is an alternative motive to it.</p>

<p>Forget about LEAPs. If you find options that provide enough leverage, all you need to do win in the correct ratio. You have 10 $1 bets on stock options. 9/10 of them lose 100%, but the tenth one makes $11, you just made your 10%.</p>

&#8220;In the stock market everyone can (in theory) win whereas a bet requires a loser.&#8221;</p>
<p>All bets require a loser, including in the stock market. The difference between a bet in the stock market and in a casino is the duration &#038; dimension of the bet. Lots of people made money during the 90&#8242;s bull market on paper &#8230; and it stayed on paper! There were sellers; there were buyers! </p>
<p>Most losers lose because of self sabotaging beliefs. And others, entertain themselves by losing. Winning is something that winners do. In the end, it all balances out.</p>
<p>Black-scholes model does not account for trend. Cuban, the payout in the markets is much greater. It depends on how one exploits a developing trend, similar  practices to ones useful in poker. Poker has to do with assessment of pot odds, reading tells and waiting for a good game to develop. Human nature at play in both gambling and the markets, but in the end the rules are more favorable in the biggest casino of them all &#8211; the markets. </p>
<p>The payout is greater in the markets because everyone comes expecting to win!</p>
<p>Markets can pass tests for randomness and also provide profits for smart money.</p>

		<p>Mark, interesting quote that ties in with your thoughts: Gambling and money management are the same.  In each the goal should be to spread risk, avoid becoming emotional, and focus on the odds.  An investor succeeds by hitting singles and doubles-not by going for the fences.  In fact a home run is a sign of a mistake, because it deviates too far from the mean. &#8220;Vegas taught me I could beat the system with a combination of hard work, ideas that no one has thought of yet, and the ability to tolerate a constant routine that to many people seems monotonous&#8221;, &#8220;but to me its the most exciting thing in the world&#8221;&#8211;Bill Gross</p>

		<p>I would be very curious Mark to find out how you would select your &#8216;managers&#8217; for this hedge fund. Would you create an open competition to find the best sports cappers? There are thousands of people who promote themselves on the web or tv &#038; brag about great winnings, however very few actually post their track record or allow an &#8216;independent&#8217; 3rd party to monitor their results. Would love to hear how you would form your &#8216;sports braintrust&#8217;.</p>

		<p>I have been in the sports handicapping/investing business online since 1996 with an exclusive focus on college sports.</p>
<p>I have envisioned having several sports handicapping funds each with its own set of guidelines (i.e. low risk, high risk, college basketball totals, college basketball money lines, college basketball underdogs, etc, etc.)  </p>
<p>This would once in for all bring legitimacy to the sports handicapping world and the handful of hard working honest guys out there like myself.  Instead of claiming great records and win percentages, handicappers could simply point to the performance of their fund.  An investor in the fund would have the advantage of getting the best lines and built in money management.  There are also sportsbooks out there who do not mind winners, they like the high volume.  It is a win-win for everyone involved.  Also, it is a lot more fun for investors to track the results of sporting events that it is to watch stock quotes come in all day.  Much more entertaining action as Mark eluded to.</p>
<p>I LOVE the idea.  I bought the domains SportsFunds.com, BetFunds.com, BettingFund.com, SportsBettingFund.com, SportsBettingFunds.com years ago but I have always been concerned of legal issues.</p>
<p>Mark, I would love to exchange thoughts and ideas on this with you.  It has been in my head for years.  Do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>Cordially,</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll have to get special exemptions from the casinos to handle the size of your bets.  The sports books are operated as loss leaders to get people into the casino but they are not designed to handle huge amounts of money.  Furthermore, they simply stop offering certain types of bets if they lose money on them.</p>
<p>For instance, In 2002 Golden Nugget stopped offering regular season over/under win totals in for NFL after their best season was an $800,000 loss.  They couldnt set the win totals  properly (i.e. San Fran Niners to win over or under 5 games this 2004 season is good example) so they just quit offering the bet. the pros kept cleaning their clocks!</p>
<p>I think your point on local teams is great one.  Getting an edge is easier with local teams/small cap companies where you can have an edge vs. the national point spread setter (generalist small cap portfolio manager) responsible for setting lines every day and unaware of nuances with an obscure team.  Again you run into a liquidity problem &#8211; you cant get enough money down on the game and you dont have enough dumb money betting Miami of Ohio basketball on a monday night so the casino cant lay off your bet.  At some point the casino will just stop taking bets.</p>
<p>I think you can get this edge in small cap stocks because </p>
<p>1)you can get that same knowledge level through conducting primary reasearch through gerson lehrman (you should buy them) tlaking to doctors about drugs or purchasing managers about retail and </p>
<p>2) you can get enough money down on your bet to justify running a $1B fund and still stay in small cap land</p>
<p>3) Enough dumb money to take other side of bet.  Tons of small cap long only managers who have to follow 1000-2000 companies by themselves with no specialist anlaysts to help get expertise on specific sectors.  They cant possibly know as much as hedge funds who hire analyst to follow 50-100 names only.  But there are enough mutual funds, long only, (with approx $6 trillion in assets vs. maybe $800B-$1trillion in hedge funds) to where you have the dumb money to take the other side of your bets.  i.e. Krispy Kreme (KKD). Hedge funds shorted for years and finally won the bet while growth funds owned it and took the other side of the short bet&#8230; and lost.</p>
<p>Best of luck &#8211; would love to talk abou this. Mavs fan, Dallas native stuck in NYC waiting for Knicks to get beaten down on the 21st! out</p>

		<p>Cuban,</p>
<p>Of all these posts I&#8217;m surprised nobody has mentioned your sneak pat on the back to NFI.  That and your proclamation of loving bonds.  It makes me wonder how invested you are in the stock as it behaves somewhat like a high-yield bond without the junk (except when false and misleading information is printed about it by a certain supposedly venerable financial rag).  Perhaps you mention it because it is consistently one of the top 10 most visited Yahoo stock message boards.</p>

		<p>I really like your idea, but i think that many others have had the same idea (and have been acting on it) for a long time now.  Those people are well aware that gambling is a Zero Sum Game (actually worse because of the vig), and the only way to consistently make money is to consistently take it away from other players.  So, the fact that &#8220;there really is far better information about your local sports team than there is about any local business in your market.&#8221; (your words) is not of primary importance.  Of more relevance would be your ability to get information that other bettors don&#8217;t have. </p>
<p>     The most obvious strategy is to influence the outcome of an event after you place a wager on it.  This is attempted, with varying degrees of success, in countless different universes.  Insurace fraud is one simple example of that.  An example in the news today would be the manipulation of the upcoming shareholder vote in Mylan Laboratories&#8217; by hedge funds who have an economic interest in the result of that vote but no net economic interest in Mylan itself (much to Carl Icahn&#8217;s chagrin).  </p>
<p>     Powerful people such as Yourself and Mr. Icahn just to name two, have a great advantage in their ability to influence outcomes.  This is an area in which you truly have an &#8220;edge&#8221;:  your own knowledge of what you intend to do in the future.  I would guess that represents the best opportunity for those fortunate enough to be in a position of power.  It is likely easier to hide your intentions and cover your tracks in areas outside of &#8220;Wall Street&#8221;, such as sports betting, and that might be the reason that your idea makes sense.  The SEC, Elliot Spitzer, etc are watching the financial markets more closely than ever- why not move into an area which has yet to fortify itself against manipulation?</p>
<p>Finally- your comments about the payout ratio are factually incorrect, and i would hate to think that some average joe is going to lose his money in Vegas because a billionaire gave him an erroneous lesson in stats.  If you play a slot machine with a payout ratio of 97% or 98% for a long time, the Casino ends up with ALL of your money, not a mere 2-3% as you state.  The 2-3% is the average amount lost by the player PER PULL on the lever. </p>
<p>    Your conclusion about the cost of placing bets using financial derivatives is based on your mistaken notion, so naturally the conclusion is mistaken as well.  In fact the exact oppposite is true: Financial derivatives that are freely traded (such as the IBM options you mentioned) are extremely efficiently priced, and therefore are very inexpensive means of placing bets.  It is harder than ever to make money trading these things because it is harder than ever to get a clear &#8220;edge&#8221; (legally or otherwise) over the other players.</p>
<p>Anyway, best of luck with this- whatever the outcome, i&#8217;m sure it will make a splash</p>

		<p>Hey Mark,<br />
I&#8217;m a professional in the hedge fund industry and would like to make the following observation regarding your comments:  you&#8217;re describing the sports bet market as having all the attributes of an efficient market (full transparency, availability of information, etc&#8230;) and the stock market as inefficient (low transparency, not enough regulation, etc&#8230;) however, smart investors make money in stocks PRECISELY because markets are inefficient, not the other way around.  Since companies &#8220;massage&#8221; their numbers, don&#8217;t disclose all their information, traders get emotional, etc&#8230;good and thorough analysis can enable an investor to bet right on a stock, in essence &#8220;reading between the lines&#8221; of financial statements.  If markets were efficient, all available information would be instantenously priced into a stock at all times, so there would be no opportunity to profit from msipricings (as hedge fund managers do).  </p>
<p>Moreover, markets that are more transparent (like global fixed income and currency markets) offer less arbitrage opportunities precisely because the information is available to everyone easily (anyone can look up US GDP on bloomberg).  </p>
<p>In any case, good luck with your fund, I look forward to hearing more about it!</p>

		<p>I would recommend setting up or investing in a legitimate US-based futures exchange, by filing with the CFTC.  Based on my research thus far, such an exchange would have to argue that the sport events-based  futures/options contracts that people would hedge/speculate on are legitimate risk management tools for a significant number of enterprises.  An endorsement from you in support of their CFTC application would be very meaningful to that exchange&#8217;s argument.</p>

		<p>Hey Mark,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an investor for a well-known, multibillion dollar long-short equity hedge fund, and also a recent graduate of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where, among other courses, I took a seminar taught by Justin Wolfers (see posting #31) entitled &#8220;Market Psychology, Behavioral Finance, and the Impact on Sports Betting Markets.&#8221;  During this seminar, we were given access to an enormous amount of empirical data and asked to generate hypotheses on ways to make money in a &#8220;black box&#8221; manner based on numerous years of historical actual performance.  I would be happy to share with you the examples that I have from this seminar, which I believe could be just the beginning of this idea&#8217;s potential.  I would also encourage you to talk to Professor Wolfers directly on the subject (his research has been mentioned in Forbes, among other places).  I have a passion for this subject and am convinced, based on this seminar that I took, that there are numerous ways to make money in a very inefficient overall sports gambling market.  I have often wondered how I could raise the capital to start something like this, but have not considered it realistic to do it on my own.

		<p>i cannot ascertain whether the hedge fund idea is something you actually plan on pursuing, or just a thought experiment to stoke discussion.  my comments are based on the assumption that this is &#8216;real.&#8217;</p>
<p>i am surprised that someone of your creativity and wealth would consider allocating time and capital to an idea that basically attempts to game a system.  the money gained in a winning bet is money taken directly from a losing gambler minus the commission taken by the house.  nothing is generated.</p>
<p>the business opportunities that you have available, due to the wealth and status you have attained, are virtually unlimited.  you could actually CREATE value and wealth instead of try to siphon off a few percentage points.  if you are short of business ideas, you could start an incubator, or a venture capital fund.  it seems to me that starting new businesses has greater long-term potential and will certainly be much more fulfilling for you and your associates.</p>

		<p>Gambling bets are binary events.  You either win or you lose 100% of your wager (in most cases).  It would be impossiple to properly hedge any bet when all you have are binary events which are not related to eachother.<br />
Another point&#8230;why would you want &#8220;perfect information&#8221; which everybody has?  You would have no &#8220;edge&#8221;!  There are too many articles about unsuccesful investors.  The fact of the mater is that 90% of professional money managers are worthless.  They add no value.  There are, however, very competent investors that over the long term have consistent, outsized returns.  Most people do not have access to these investors. Including the press.<br />
Mark, I&#8217;m a little dissapointed with the content in your blog.  It sounds like something CNBC would write.</p>

		<p>Mr. Cuban, there are wiseguys throughout Vegas making hundreds of thousands in sports bets each and every year.  The perception is that the house always wins but their average return is only about 5% annually, by far the lowest out of any games the casino offers.  The vast majority of this profit, like you mention, comes from a betting public that knows very little about the teams they bet on, often inflating lines by betting on favorites.  Sure your Mavs are going to win the majority of the games they play this year, but will they cover 4,6 or 10 point spreads?  Most of the betting public doesn&#8217;t differentiate between a cover and a win.  </p>
<p>The key to your project&#8217;s success is picking the right managers for this hedge fund.  There is absolutely no program or model that will accurately predict winners 60% of the time.  If such a model existed, there would be no betting market.  </p>
<p>The right handicapper needs to mix gut instincts with statistical analysis.  Rely solely on the former and you&#8217;re no better than the betting public that perennially loses.  Those that rely on the latter often miss the mental aspects or nuances of a game that go far beyond the numbers.  Revenge games, fatigue, home or away are all difficult aspects to quantify.  </p>
<p>Lastly, a lot of people have mentioned starting your own sportsbook.  Sure, it&#8217;s a profitable venture, but what&#8217;s more enjoyable than being the underdog and going after the house??</p>

		<p>I actually think Mark STOLE these ideas.  </p>
<p>I just finished a book called &#8220;Investing in College Basketball&#8221; that contains EXACTLY the same arguments.  (I got it from Amazon).</p>
<p>The book talks about investing in college basketball as a stock market where you know more about the stocks than anyone else. Where most of the other investors are amatuers, not professionals. Where there are few frauds like Enron, Marsh, WorldCom or HealthSouth to tank your portfolio. Where investment gains come immediately, not after years. Where there are dozens of brokers keeping commissions low. </p>
<p>The book also goes into information availability and different kinds of bets (first halfs, second halfs, interactives, etc.)</p>
<p>Mark, you and the author are so in sync.  He should be the manager of your fund!</p>

I have been a &#8216;stockbroker&#8217; or a &#8216;financial adviser&#8217; (for lack of better descriptions) for the last 13 years.  Wall Street makes me sick.  The average person, who my whole business is made up of, has NO shot in the stock market, and only a decent shot in growth/value funds.  I will not let any clients of mine own a stock.  There is not one publicly traded company that cares about its shareholders.  Look at the shareholders of WCOM and KMart after they declared bankruptcy.  They were left with nothing.  Now KM has gone on to make a lot of people huge money &#8212; except the original shareholders, typically the little guy. Anyone with any knowledge got out prior to the BK.  </p>
<p>The reason that I say most investors have a decent shot in funds, if they own the right ones and there is such a thing, is because the marketing machine of Wall Street does not advertise the &#8216;best&#8217; funds.  Most of the better funds do not advertise, because they do not want the expense, because it costs the shareholders in the long run.  However, most clients are not smart or logical, only emotional.  They only want to buy what they see advertised and that is typically the garbage product only produced so the fund company can make the huge money.  So after many years in business, my book has low turnover because I have fought the uphill battle of teaching, teaching, and teaching my clients to stay on the right track and not to flip in and out of the hot funds.  </p>
<p>The other half of my book is in bonds.  And guess what?  Within my industry, I was not looked at fondly by my brokerage house because I did not flip clients around, I bought either no-load or C shares, and I had a lot of clients in their 30&#8242;s and 40&#8242;s in bonds &#8212; which are investments that firms don&#8217;t like unless you are trading them.  All firms want brokers to produce commissions at any cost to the client.  We are taught that &#8220;moving money around is the name of the game&#8221;.  I reject that logic entirely, which is the reason that I do not, and will not, work for a large firm.  </p>
<p>It is good to read your sane comments regarding Wall Street because I feel the same as you.  Wall Street, CNBC, CNNfm, Rukeyser, and all that crap makes me sick that my normal, &#8216;hardworking Americans&#8217; have to be subjected to those talking heads without any real desire to give objective, sensible advice.</p>

In the three years I worked with him our NFL fund return was greater than that of the futures fund.

		<p>In response to Ted Buturin&#8217;s post:</p>
<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly about brokerage firms, money managers and the entire &#8220;promotional&#8221; complex. David Swensen, the CIO of Yale&#8217;s endowment fund, remarked at a Congressional hearing last year that there are about a dozen mutual funds worth investing in. Hyperbole aside, I think that he&#8217;s absolutely correct. However, taking isolated events such as KMRT and applying them to the whole of the equities market is an extreme and logically flawed position. You can&#8217;t be an uninformed active investor or trader and expect to make money. It&#8217;s that simple. I certainly feel for pre-Chapter 11 KMRT common holders, employees who lost their jobs and others impacted by the restructuring. But you could just as easily have purchased the bonds (along with Eddie Lampert and Marty Whitman) before the filing, which were converted to common post-filing. Tyco, Enron, Worldcom and other cases of corporate malfeasance and outright fraud do little to inspire investor confidence in corporate America. But the majority of managements don&#8217;t engage in fraudulent activity and are concerned most with maintaining and growing their enterprises. There is usually money to be made somewhere in the markets (long or short), whether through investing in equities, fixed income, real estate, currencies or commodities. If you are convinced that the average investor doesn&#8217;t stand a chance in choosing individual equities, then you may want to consider an ETF portfolio for your clients that is automatically rebalanced on an annual or semiannual basis, a service which one major online brokerage firm currently provides for 50 basis points/year.</p>

		<p>MARK CUBAN !!!<br />
I read your comments in the newspaper and you are on to something.Seldom have the resources of a billionaire been applied in the sports betting business.Some of it can be coupled with your specialty COMMUNICATIONS.<br />
I have owned 2 premium SPORTS BOOKS.In my career I have been a pioneer on the bookmaking side,most notably in the field of halftimes.<br />
Now I am strictly involved only on the player side,but since my chance of getting to speak to you directly are not good,I will put a few ideas for the WORLD to see,you will have my E-MAIL and my identity can easily be confirmed.I spend half the year in NYC and half the year in Vegas and can present a list of concrete proposals in a days notice.</p>
<p>AS A HALFTIME EXPERT<br />
I can give you a concrete example.<br />
The NBA games and major universities are under tremendous scrutiny.<br />
BUT<br />
when SIENA plays NIAGARA<br />
and it is not on TV<br />
IF THE LINE IS 8<br />
and NIAGARA is up by 4<br />
4 will be the 2nd half line !!!   PERIOD<br />
even if 3 Siena PLAYERS leave on crutches and 3 have 4 fouls.<br />
COORDINATING a group of kids to attend every game and getting quality halftime reports and charting the success of the reporters ,we could form a network with shrewd observers,and destroy the very weak market.<br />
I have 5 employees and on a small scale we are destroying it.</p>
<p>RADIO LISTENING ROOMS<br />
between real player and Yahoo almost all college hoop and pro hoop are available on radio,almost all have pre game interviews with the coaches,sometimes a coach may say either his team is surprisingly banged up or they are going to change the tempo of the game ,making the total of the hoop game radically off.We could organize listening rooms after employees were trained what to listen for.<br />
They could have stats for the teams in front of them so they would be able to know if a player removed from a lineup would have an impact.<br />
on the PRO level injuries are the key factor<br />
it is an ankle and knee problem sport as ,extra long people go up and down on a hard floor constantly doing damage.<br />
There are many game time decisions.<br />
1 year Allen Iverson was questionable so many times they would make a generic 76er line.<br />
It would be 5 when it really was 3 or 7<br />
We could position ourselves to be first in that regard.<br />
Baseball is MY SPECIALTY<br />
with the vig half of what it is in foots or hoops,there are plenty of times where billionaire money when a market is 20-28 ,and we can lay all the 20&#8242;s and get the lines past 30 .Especially when we have the lineups first ,which to my knowledge ,I am already in possession of.I pay good money for that service but in 12 out of 15 games i usually have the lineups well before they are posted on Don Best ,which is the industry standard.<br />
While some of the work I have done with pitchers I consider to be unremarkable ,I have detailed offensive studies which really predict vs the spread how teams will produce.<br />
Much of what is important in a baseball game as described in MONEYBALL and confirmed by owners who are hiring GM&#8217;s to acquire the right type of baseball can be applied.<br />
Their formulas are based on getting players who provide production on a per season or multi-season baseball,they key betting baseball day by day is to isolate it with a degree of accuracy on a GIVEN DAY.<br />
I will tell you that on May 26th when trying to bet game 44  a player is who he is<br />
on  a  LONG TERM INTERVAL<br />
over who he is on a short term interval.</p>
<p>I already have computer guys on the payroll<br />
and everyday players are fit into a grid and team offenses on a given day vary differently to the spreads.<br />
There are times when I have a GAME RATED DEAD EVEN</p>
<p>where you are able to take $ 1. 60<br />
In a meeting I will show revolutionary baseball ratings.</p>
<p>I can tell you<br />
I could not coach a basketball team<br />
I could not coach a football team<br />
I could MANAGE a baseball team.</p>
<p>Anyway those are some concrete suggestions<br />
I hope someone is in charge of getting this message to you.<br />
IF you E-Mail me I can pass on relevant information so you can verify my identity before going further.</p>

		<p>As much as I love your other views (esp the trashing of Trump who I have derided as a fraud for 20 years) this gambling hedge fund will end in disaster. First off, the stock market is NOT a zero sum game as gambling is.  Sure, there a lots of idiots who buy shares in fly-by-night stocks that pay no dividend on just the hope a greater fool will come along.  So what?  Does that mean you have to lower yourself to literally gambling with a fund?  Makes no sense.</p>
<p>The likelihood of the entire planet ceasing to buy a Coke product for 6 months and cratering the stock to zero is nonexistent.  The likelihood of Manning getting up on the wrong side of bed and getting completely killed in a supposedly easy game is FAR more likely.</p>
<p>Further,  your involvement in the NBA will preclude you from getting involved in this AND good luck finding a book to take the kind of size you are going to have to throw around to make this venture worthwhile.  The stock market is hugely liquid &#8211; sportsbooks are not. Wait and see how you move the line with just a relatively small bet.  </p>
<p>I have been a bookie for 5 years and not ONE of my customers has made money.  And they have all the information in the world.  Nothing can protect against a crazy outcome (Bucs vs Colts on MNF last year, the Pistons brawl stopping the clock with 45 seconds left and dooming the people who bet the over by 3 points, etc, etc)</p>
<p>I suspect this is all tongue-in-cheek to point fun at what a casino the stock market currently is at its wildly overvalued level.  Of course, it was dupes like these who made you rich.</p>
<p>If this ever does get off the ground (which I highly doubt) I am willing to publicly wager you $20,000 that your five-year returns will be negative.  Sincerely Matt Beauchamp 407-340-2405 &#8211; I am serious about the bet.</p>

		<p>I LOVE this idea.  I&#8217;ve been a sports gambler for the better part of 2 years, following strict money management strategies.  Honestly, it&#8217;s been like stealing.  With this success, I&#8217;ve truly given consideration to establishing a fund (obviously on a much smaller scale) and managing the money through sports gambling &#8220;investments.&#8221;  You&#8217;ve beaten me to the punch, and on a MUCH larger scale.  So&#8230;do you need an analyst?  It would be my dream job!</p>

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this idea is better or the buzz you are creating.  I do believe there is money to be made and do know one person that does make money gambling on sports.  I try to learn from him as much as possible.  I have been gambling on and off for the past 8 years and overall I am down of course.  What has changed for me though in the last 3 months is the knowledge I have gained from this person.  And my returns have been very good.</p>
<p>Picking your managers will be very difficult.  So many people throw up smokescreens when it comes to gambling.  I like to equate pick services to stock brokers.  You should never higher anyone that has had anything to do with a pick service.   They are constantly ripping people off just like brokers are everyday.</p>

		<p>As you mention in your posting, most recreational gamblers go to Vegas expecting to lose, and when it comes to sports gambling, it&#8217;s no different.  They bet the games to &#8220;up the ante&#8221; and/or make their viewing experience more interesting, but over the long haul, very few should expect to win any money.  As with blackjack players and slot addicts, the thrill is the action, not the potential payoff.  For that reason, if you started a fund like this, it would be essential that each &#8220;investor&#8221; be aware of each bet that is placed by the fund.  Additionally, the rules by which both casinos and offshore gambling establishments operate prohibit bets above a predetermined maximum ($5,000 to $10,000 in my experience).  As you are aware, any reputable sportsbook knows that wagers above this amount would only attract &#8220;smart money&#8221;, and that&#8217;s exactly what each hopes to avoid.  For that reason, if you were to raise a hedge fund of any significant size, how would you lay off bets?  In other words, if you&#8217;re running a $100 million fund, it&#8217;s futile to go around placing $10,000 wagers, all of which have very little impact on the return to your &#8220;investors&#8221;.  Not to mention the built-in &#8220;vig&#8221; of 10% that you pay on losing bets.  If you run the numbers, you have to pick something like 56% &#8211; 58% of your games correctly JUST to break even&#8230; That&#8217;s hardly a slam dunk in my book.</p>

		<p>Well Mark you will need to invest in something new once you loss all your money in Charter (CHTR). Amazing to me you still own that stock while Paul Allen your moron of a friend screws the shareholders everyday. Only problem with sports betting is the fix is just as bad as Wall Street. Even if you use tradesports you’re still going to have no advantage. Market makers use overs and unders for a reason. That’s the problem with sports betting. I can always figure out roughly who will win, but can I beat the fixed and manipulated odds? Good luck, you’re going to need it. Your not the first person to think of this either, hedge funds are already doing it with tradesports. They bet on more then just sports as I am sure you know.</p>

		<p>If this is a serious proposal, I have to echo the suggestion that you&#8217;d probably be better off working as the House. The problem with the player side of the table is that it doesn&#8217;t scale well. The casinos won&#8217;t let you make big enough bets to get a decent ROI once your bankroll is more than a million or so. Only a few casinos allow really big bets, and they keep close track of the big players, eventually barring the biggest winners even if they can&#8217;t figure out why you won.</p>
<p>My game of choice is blackjack, and I was on a team with a 6-figure bankroll some years ago. Now I&#8217;m listed in the Griffin Book and mostly can&#8217;t play under my own name. Blackjack might work for your venture if you could recruit and train a continuous stream of new faces, but quality control is very difficult. It takes a while to develop the necessary expertise and you need to make sure your players are playing well even when you aren&#8217;t watching them. Your players can&#8217;t all use the same strategy or the same betting range or be seen together. And at the larger stakes, when you get barred at one casino they send the picture around everywhere else too.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s intriguing. Teams do have a huge advantage over individual players if you can make it work.</p>

		<p>Mark,<br />
For the first time I can&#8217;t understand the logic in your post.  I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s a test because I think you know that the NBA would probably not allow you to pursue this venture.  The way a person make REAL money from their investments is the VERY reason that you mention as the problem with investing in stocks &#8211; inefficient information.  It&#8217;s that the majority is usually wrong and are too lazy to do the due dilligance to make an informed decision.  When a situation arises where there is large amounts of information like sports betting, the difficulty in making money in such a venture is extremely difficult.  You have to beat the juice and the spread &#8211; the people making the spread have access to all the information and more that you are talking about so the sports betting market works very efficiently.  If you throw in the juice you are setting yourself up to lose 100% or make 91% on each investment.  I doubt that you would put your money in any venture where the risk is 100% loss only to have the gain capped at 91% &#8211; you scored a much higher return with your business ventures.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised that you have brought this up as a viable venture.  I&#8217;m even more surprised to see all these people thinking that this is a great idea.  An individual makes money because the markets are inefficient not because they are efficient &#8211; every finance undergrad understands this &#8211; if efficient market theory holds true nobody makes money in the markets because it assumes that all the information is public.  You have acknowledged that this is not true &#8211; therefore, there are more money making opportunities in the markets.  Sports betting works more efficiently than the markets because of the vast amount of information out there so it&#8217;s logical that a gambler will have a more difficult time making money because they have to beat the spread which is a reflection of ALL that information.  </p>
<p>I hope that you were joking at this suggestion and look forward to you posting about money making opportunites in business and capital markets.</p>

		<p>Ok, sorry for the double post, I currently run HedgeBlog at my website <a href="http://www.xhedgefund.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.xhedgefund.com</a> and this is my latest entry:</p>
<p>Mark Cuban&#8217;s Hedge Fund Article<br />
I am extremely skeptical, more than skeptical that Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks is launching a Las Vegas style gambling hedge fund.</p>
<p>He cannot do this without David Stern going ballistic on him! Just not possible.</p>
<p>So after visiting his blog and reading the 100+ and counting comments I came to the conclusion that he lured all us hedge fund people over there to see his nifty blog. It was so nifty that I wanted to trade this one in for theirs!</p>
<p>My snooping around led me to the company that hosts his blog. It&#8217;s a company called Weblogs, Inc. and he is the seed investor in that company. It appears that they are targeting their product to different niches and currently have 50 blogs up and running. This is not a blogger for the average person, it seems like it is invite only with editors to boot.</p>
<p>With blogs all the rage, Mark Cuban just gave us a nice little demonstration of its reach and potential, better than anything he could do with a Powerpoint presentation. We&#8217;ve all been suckered by Mark Cuban! Now who wants to invest in his blog company because this was the best Powerpoint presentation on Weblogs, Inc. you could possibly give.</p>

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p>The fund could get a lot of attention from institutional investors and large asset managers in the pension and endowment fund business, because of the diversity it could bring to their portfolios, as well as the superior returns.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that &#8220;betting&#8221; is what the entire financial sector is in the business of.  It all comes down to risk/reward.  The controversy stems from the fact that most lay people aren&#8217;t going to understand it unless it is put in perspective.  Sports and entertainment represents a huge sector of the economy and the synergies between it and the rest of the financial community have never been exploited.  Good PR for this will be essential.</p>
<p>The fund could actually be set up to be effectively self managing (by indexing the fund to existing odds boards in Vegas that already have visibility).   This would dramatically reduce overhead costs at the same time.  This reliability would help make the fund more attractive to large outside investors and would legitimize it to the public at large.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a 28 year old about to graduate with a Masters in Finance and Economics up here in Boston.  I&#8217;ve become somewhat of a sports specialist on all of my class related projects (much to the dismay of my professors).  I&#8217;ve come up with a proposal for the NHL to get back in gear through a bond securitization of their TV contracts and other revenues that could fetch as much as $10 billion for the NHL right away and countless millions for bankers&#8230;the project is still an academic exercise at this point.  I&#8217;ve also done an econometrics project on football plays in the red zone&#8230;my results were reviewed by Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;d love to be associated with this at any level given that I believe it has the potential to become the first and most successful fund of its kind given the exposure that you could bring to the table.</p>

		<p>Where would you get the volume to make this worthwhile?  Sportsbooks don&#8217;t just take three million dollar bets.  Their whole goal is to be flat, and just keep the juice.  You could use tradesports.com or some other online futures market, but their isn&#8217;t enough volume there for a hedge fund of any size.</p>
<p>You could start your own sportsbook, but then there are legal issues galore and if your lines don&#8217;t match up with other sportsbooks, people will only give you one sided action, a huge risk.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think sports betting is scaleable, at least not now.  I normally like what you have to say, and you never said how you actually plan place your bets but i find it hard to believe that you are serious.</p>

		<p>Traditional gambling is great, if you know how to utilize the information and pick your spots you can basically just wait around and make tremendously positive EV bets.  The only problem is, you&#8217;ll never be able to scale any operation to  any significant size.  Sure, if you get all-in AA heads up vs. AK in a game on NL hold&#8217;em, great for you, but how much could you possibly have riding on that bet?  Let&#8217;s be extreme and say $1M.. a near worthless figure if you&#8217;re managing a small portfolio let&#8217;s say 250M.  Same thing with blackjack or sports betting, you&#8217;re not going to find anyone who&#8217;s willing to give you action at any sort of significant level that you&#8217;ll have any sustainable edge in.  The only plausible way to build a true fund would be to hire hundreds of the best gamblers in the world who could each manage a seperate bankroll of a few hundred thousand? million? the costs of which would be astronomical&#8230; provided you can identify (skill vs luck) and convince them to work for you.</p>

		<p>This is going to be very difficult to implement for a number of reasons:</p>
<p>1. economies of scale&#8230;for &#8220;market&#8221;-type betting (sports, horses, etc), the more money you put in, the more you are moving the odds (payout) against you.  There is a limit to your profitability due to this.</p>
<p>2. Finding enough profitbale bets.  For normal casino games, the casinos will move to eliminate any exploitable, provitable edge when it starts costing them enough money&#8230;this is why you now see reduced pay tables for video poker, continuous shufflers and no mid-shoe entry for blackjack, etc.  Casinos will only allow so much money to flow out their doors until they put a stop to it.</p>
<p>3. Sure, you could &#8220;employ&#8221; skilled people such as expert poker players or top sports hadndicappers.  But to have them work for you, you would have to pay them MORE than they are making playing for themselves.</p>
<p>In all, this is a much more complicated proposition than a lot of people seem to believe, never mind the regulatory and legal issues.</p>

		<p>Comments 122, 123 and 128 touch on the biggest challenge you&#8217;ll face&#8211;that is finding a way to extract the inefficiencies in a scalable manner.  It comes down to a combination software architecture, statistics and common sense engineering problem at the end of the day.  The answer is a small team of experienced arbitrage traders who are versed in software development, sophisticated data analysis/mathematical techniques and a large measure of creativity and common sense.  The entire investing process will need to be almost completely automated in order to make the economics work out.  You won&#8217;t be able to afford much overhead either.  It&#8217;s a lot of fun and very doable if you&#8217;ve the right skillset though.</p>

		<p>Iâ€™d have to say that 10% of the â€œutilityâ€ of this, my first visit to blogmaverick.com, has come from the reading of Mr. Cubanâ€™s article and the other 90% has come from perusing his readersâ€™ replies. What a high winner-to-whiner ratio we have here (as opposed to say, your typical Yahoo stock message board). For instance, congratulations to Patrick Muldoon from post 26 whose worst year since he started sports betting in 1995 was a $16,000 gain. I just do stocks and not sports and wouldnâ€™t have thought such consistent winnings were possible in the latter arena; my visit to this blog has been a heads-up. On the other hand, shame on broker Ted Baturin (#96) for having such a defeatist attitudeâ€¦</p>
<p>â€œThe average person, who my whole business is made up of, has NO shot in the stock market, and only a decent shot in growth/value funds.â€</p>
<p>I venture to say that your experience with your customer base is not representative of the entire universe of investors and traders. The truly competent ones will not have come your way for 2 reasons: 1) high commissions and 2) your â€œcanâ€™t doâ€ attitude would inflict too much of a strain on the broker-client relationship. And to Matt Beauchamp from #107 who has been â€œ a bookie for 5 years and not ONE of my customers has made moneyâ€, if you had had any winners wouldnâ€™t you have chased them away anyway ?</p>
<p>There have been a lot of thought provoking posts on this blogâ€¦</p>
<p>#19) I never stopped to think about how much $$ PartyPoker takes in. Iâ€™m afraid weâ€™ll be seeing their commercials for some time to come.</p>
<p>#27) Iâ€™ve done well in the stock market for a number of years and have a high degree of confidence in my abilities. So why not give Marketocracy a try and get a crack at managing some money professionally ?</p>
<p>#31, 79) This Justin Wolfers looks like heâ€™s worth further investigation. With academia being such a stronghold of the random walk mindset, itâ€™s refreshing that he would encourage his students to do blackbox experimentation.</p>
<p>#33) SAC, Paloma, Andrew Lo, etc. are worth a look too. I love reading about winners.</p>
<p>#42) Iâ€™m sure heads are going to wag on this but I canâ€™t help looking at the stock market in a similar fashion re: the changing odds that face the blackjack player. One low card played means one less low card in the deck. And a 500,000 share block just dumped means thereâ€™s 500,000 less shares of overhead â€“ the more oversold a stock gets, the more worthy it is of consideration. Similarly, a sudden change in the futures vs fair value will have an effect on heavily traded stocks that can last as long as several minutes. And important developments at a particular company will most likely have an effect on the sister stocks in its sector that will a) not be immediately reflected in their stock prices and b) last for several hours, days, or even weeks. (What Iâ€™m suggesting with these last two points is that some stock market events are not independent of each other in the same fashion that youâ€™d expect successive rolls of the die to be)</p>
<p>#51) Are you talking about Bill Gross, the world famous bond manager ? He hadnâ€™t struck me as being a Vegas guy. Iâ€™d love a link to read more about his take on his gambling experiences.</p>
<p>#64) What a train wreck at the Golden Nugget. As long as the House leaves itself open from time to time, I guess thereâ€™s hope.</p>
<p>#119) Your work was reviewed by Belichick ? Seriously ?? Did he indicate that he would incorporate any of your findings into his playbook ?</p>
<p>Final Comment: </p>
<p>For a number of reasons I donâ€™t see the stock market being as similar to gambling as Mr. Cubanâ€™s article implies. But the most relevant one has been highlighted by some of the latest posts. The sports betting world just canâ€™t absorb the size that the stock market can. Even Buffett, at 40 billion, can still find ways to play. </p>
<p>But Iâ€™m not sure that a maximizing of gambling $$ is what Mark is after if he decides to proceed. Just showing that it could be done would yield great satisfaction. It would also provide an opportunity to re-educate the public about the workings of risk and reward. And the dollar value that could be placed on the publicity that would ensue from creating a successful multiyear track record (with having a strategy of keeping the bet size manageable so as not to strain the sports betting complex) would probably exceed the value of the actual winnings.</p>

		<p>To Mark:<br />
First of all, your idea can only be accomplished on a large scale with sports betting (vs casino games, poker, etc). It&#8217;s the<br />
only gambling market w/ enough volume/liquidity that will allow you to &#8220;take&#8221; large amounts of money from Joe Public vis-a-vis the bookmakers/intermediaries.</p>
<p>Here are your 3 constraints:</p>
<p>1. Can you &#8220;beat the market&#8221; w/ a high enough winning % overcome transaction costs ?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. The sports betting market is inefficient. Not that anyone has inside information. But the information is &#8220;weighted&#8221; incorrectly. The &#8220;value&#8221; that the public places on pieces of information is not aligned with the &#8220;true value&#8221; of those pieces of information. This creates inaccurate point spreads. The factors which are weighted incorrectly are both statistical (e.g. yards per rush) and psychlogical (e.g. quantifying the &#8220;value&#8221; of a team in a must win situation).</p>
<p>If you run the #&#8217;s in a spreadsheet, you will find that by picking 55% pointspread winners in only 5% of &#8220;bettable&#8221; US pro &#038; college events each year, you will achieve ROI of at least 100% on your bankroll. (this varies depending on the size of each wager).</p>
<p>For those skeptics who think sports betting is efficient, think again. See:<br />
<a href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/10.03/betting.html" rel="nofollow">http://wired.com/wired/archive/10.03/betting.html</a></p>
<p>2. Can you overcome practical limitations imposed on winning gamblers by the casinos ?</p>
<p>Answer: Do this in Vegas? &#8211; forget it. Consistent Winning players are shut off in Vegas, and its moot anyway, since bet limits are &#8220;low&#8221; there. It would need to be done by a syndicate which hits offshore books, or by using one of the online exchanges, where there are no limits (e.g. betfair.com or betbug.com). On these exchanges, you can sucker the public in by offering them more attractive point spreads on the &#8220;wrong&#8221; side. Over time, I think these exchanges will grow in volume, b/c of their low transaction costs. The other option would be to start/acquire an offshore casino (but see the case Cohen v US).</p>
<p>3. Can you overcome legal issues ?</p>
<p>Answer: Of course your lawyers are working on this. My take is that While the recent WTO ruling in favor of Antigua vs the US provides hope that online sports wagering will be legalized here, your best bet in the meantime would be a several pronged approach: </p>
<p>- acquire an offshore casino (but see the case Cohen v US), and vary your pointspreads to attract money to the &#8220;wrong&#8221; side. Lest you think people will figure you out, you could use decoy spreads on other games (after calculating the elasticity of demand for spreads and teams). Also see this article: <a href="http://www.theregister.com/2004/03/23/lock_down_gambling_sites_go/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theregister.com/2004/03/23/lock_down_gambling_sites_go/</a></p>
<p>- acquire offshore casino, and only accept wagers from non-US bettors (lower volume though)</p>
<p>- in lieu of acquiring an offshore casino, run the fund from a country where placing wagers is legal</p>
<p>About me: I use artificial intelligence (neural networks) to develop models that look for mispriced point spreads. I have a degree in Operations Research, and had a perfect score of 800 on my Math SAT. I won&#8217;t brag about my record &#8211; we would really need to talk for me to convince you and/or your analysts that I know what I am doing here. </p>

		<p>Mr. Cuban,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading the responses to your desire to start a new hedge fund<br />
with great interest. Everybody wants to join in, but what they bring to<br />
the table seems to have little value for this venture.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see any &#8220;best andthe brighest&#8221; showing up here. Where are the<br />
responses from the best handicappers?  The best developers?</p>
<p>Surely you can&#8217;t have a hedge fund for horses if you can&#8217;t pick winners.<br />
All the wall street smarts in the world won&#8217;t prepare you for making<br />
money at the track. It appears that horse racing people don&#8217;t have a wall<br />
street background, the wall street people don&#8217;t have a horse racing<br />
background.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a developer with over 25+ years of software development experience.<br />
I have been developing trading and handicapping systems since 1978.<br />
You&#8217;ll be looking a long time to find someone with my various<br />
combination of skill sets and vertical market applications experience.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been developing a product that I think you&#8217;ll find most useful for<br />
this venture. In short, I have a 750,000+ line J2EE Java application<br />
built over many years, for the sole purpose of making money at the track.<br />
Nothing like it, anywhere. Period!</p>
<p>I would like to keep the product features, and the various business<br />
models associated with it on a closed communication channel between<br />
you and myself for now.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there way a way that I could send you a private email,<br />
or set up a phone conversation or a possible demo of my product with you.</p>
<p>I am trying to keep the discussion of what I have, and what it does down<br />
to a minimum.</p>
<p>I assume that you&#8217;re located in Texas, and I&#8217;m willing to fly there to<br />
give you a demo.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m confident that you&#8217;ll find that what I&#8217;ve built, very well suited to<br />
putting your hedge fund in to a fully operational state.</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;best and the brighest&#8221;, there can be only one.</p>
<p>Just call me &#8220;HighLander&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>I hope that you maintain my email address as private, and that we can<br />
enguage in some form of communication.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

		<p>Would be interested to hear how this Hedge Fund goes. I am considering a similar venture in the UK. In the UK the betting market is slightly more evolved, and with betting exchanges growing, the market is now barely an over-round, so you only need to beat the market by 1-2%. The only problem would be finding sufficient equity in the market to support the high-value investments you are undoubtedly considering. But with betting volumes growing month on month, this problem is going to lessen as time goes on. </p>
<p>The advantage of the sports market is that a significant percentage of money in the market is &#8216;emotional money&#8217; rather than &#8216;logical money&#8217;. Therefore finding that 1-2% margin is that much easier.<br />
Good luck,<br />

		<p>MARK,<br />
I&#8217;ve paid my way through college, and have never had a real job. In the age of the internet (or internets pending where your from) all the information you need is right there. I&#8217;ve also found that personally I have the most success in Baseball. Did you know Vegas makes the least amount of money on baseball. The percentage of players that gamble on the sport is less than the other big two, but Vegas takes there biggest hit in this sport. Why? First of all, one is basiclly just capping pitchers, rather than a whole football team or basketball team. Secondly, baseball is harder to fix. I know some people don&#8217;t believe in fixes, but trust me it happens. Watching football is basiclly theater in motion. The last aspect that makes baseball not only the eaisest sport to cap but also the most profitable is the good ole money line. There are no half point loses or pushes. If you take no chalk the whole year and bet 1-2 units a day on dogs, one could hit at a 42% clip and make a profit. And that is your average bettor. If someone such as myself that knows what there doing can make a pretty penny. Anyway, I know I might not be making a lot of sense, but trust me it works.<br />
P.S. I like the Mavs +6.5 tonight.</p>

		<p>This will just get people more excited about gambling on sporting events.  Then we will have more hedge funds with this idea, most of which will be bad hedge funds because Mark will get the top gamblers to work for him.  So in the long run we will have more people with gambling problems and on top of that they&#8217;ll be losing money because they can&#8217;t afford to buy into Marks fund, but instead go with Tommy&#8217;s fund from down the block.</p>

<p>I am currently a student at Brown University concentrating in Busniness Economics / Public &#038; Private Sector Organizations.

I have extensive experience and a good track record in horse racing as well as profitable poker experiences.

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p> I am writing to you because of the power you hold in the United States Marketplace and Wall Street. I am sure that if someone who was employed by YOU at one of your companies, stole from the company by counterfeiting some of the companys checks, or stock certificates or personnel info&#8230;.that you would take the appropriate actions and insure that the individual was fired if not prosecuted.<br />
 Now, as I initially stated above, you have a large amount of influence and POWER in what trends are excepted or rejected. Therefore I am BEGGING YOU to PLEASE take a look at the rampant COUNTERFEITING OF STOCK SHARES that has been going on in the marketplace for a couple of years now. While I understand that the stock borrowing pool had a purpose once, it&#8217;s time has now past! You are aware that this is going on in the US marketplace, yet I have seen NO REPRESENTATION by you of it&#8217;s wrongfullness. Now is the time to take a side on this issue and be a leader within the reform that MUST TAKE PLACE if the market is to continue on it&#8217;s upward climb. Therefore, I am personally inviting you to be my guest at a RALLY against the Counterfeiting of Stock Shares, on the steps of the DTCC on July 29th, 2005! Show your support for the average investors who sink their hard earned money into the companies that are being stolen away! Please respond! Thank you.</p>

I have the key element that will make your idea a monster. Something is missing from your model and I have it. I&#8217;ve worked the past few years perfecting a business model like yours but much more advanced and thought out. Due dillegence has been done, business plan in order, and with the proper non disclosure agreement in place, I would share it with you. It&#8217;s yours to say no too.</p>

		<p>Hi Mark:</p>
<p>Are you interested in having a completely automated sports arbitrage trading robot make money for your new hedge fund?</p>
<p>Based on my personal experience over the past six months all of the sportsbooks are very quick to adjust their odds to eliminate arbitrage trading opportunities. To mitigate this I&#8217;ve developed the skill to execute a trade manually in less than 2 minutes while applying a proprietary eight-step process that eliminates virtually all the risk.</p>
<p>It has become patently apparent to me that this manual training process should be replaced with an automated system. I have many years of experience building web crawlers for the staff recruiting, office supply, electronic component and automotive sales industries. I have built proprietary tools based on reverse engineering the HTTP protocol that allows me to reliably convert web pages designed for use by humans into computer sensible data.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re both interested in making money&#8230; I can create the robot. Are you, or do you know someone, interested in handling the business side?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

		<p>After many varied investigations as a police officer over a 34 year career, it never ceases to amaze me how many truly smart people, yes even brilliant people, tend to spend their lives on the edge of the law, or at least on the edge of moral obligation, just to make a fast buck.</p>
<p>Some of the brilliant people on this blog are cases in point. So are Bernie Ebbers, Martha, Lord Conrad Black et al.  They too had brilliant ideas.</p>
<p>Take care not to follow in their foot steps, as you use your obvious talents to walk down the slippery slope of pure profit. </p>
<p>Hey &#8220;pure&#8221; profit!  Now there is an oxymoron! </p>
<p>If even half of you used your brilliance to actually help other people, I have no doubt it would be returned to you tenfold. </p>

<p>I recently came up with this exact idea.<br />In reasearching this concept I came across your blog from more than 2 years ago.<br />I would greatly appreciate it if you could bring me up to speed on where you are with this Fund.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<p>Has the fund ben formed? If so how?<br />If not, is it still in play?<br />What obstacles have to be overcome? Regulatory, logistical, etc.</p>
<p>I\&#8217;m sure any other wisdom you can impart on this idea would save me alot of time/headaches.</p>

		<p>So, You are starting new Hedge Fund, so i might think to help you.<br />Let You have to know something about Equity Market Neutral- State-of-the art Arbitrage Strategy for every market environment.</p>
<p>The classification of different \&#8221;hedge funds\&#8221; is not entirely straightforward since some funds may use a combination of strategies, if they disclose anything at all. These categories can be categorized further in many ways, but our return generating technique should be categorized as a market neutral statistical arbitrage investment process, which designed to be among the less risky \&#8221;hedge fund strategies\&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reason we chose market neutral is because its one of the few products where \&#8221;neutrality\&#8221; is a core attribute. Neutrality implies something about what risks are being taken and which are not, so which risks are being taken in market neutral? The term <br />\&#8221;market neutral\&#8221; clearly implies that the portfolio should in some sense be neutral with respect to the market itself. Believing that equities behave in a mathematically describable manner, we can implement a low-risk, market-neutral analytical equity strategy. </p>
<p>Equity Market Neutral investment refers to funds that hedge against market risk factors, thereby becoming \&#8221;neutral\&#8221; to the market. Market Neutral- Statistical Arbitrage utilizes quantitative analysis of technical factors to exploit pricing inefficiencies between related assets, neutralizing exposure to market risk by combining long and short positions. It is an Arbitrage process of buying assets in one market and selling them in another to profit from unjustifiable price differences. This violates the expectation that the same product should sell for the same price. </p>
<p>The ability to \&#8221;hedge\&#8221; is a necessary condition for arbitrage because it can eliminate risk. Thus, a hedging transaction is intended to reduce or eliminate the risk of a primary security or portfolio position. An investor consequently establishes a secondary position that is designed to counterbalance some or all of the risk associated with another investmentposition. </p>
<p>This strategy can also be classified as absolute return strategy since the return is independent of the performance of the underlying market and hence a return may be generated whether the market goes up or down. Absolute return strategies represent an investment style or discipline, and are usually classified as a subset of the alternative asset investment class. Absolute return performance is primarily derived from RCGF manager skill, and not from the overall direction of a traditional market, such as equities or fixed income.</p>
<p>There are tremendous advantages to having an equity market neutral style in an investment portfolio. Notably, returns are independent and uncorrelated to market direction. Volatility is usually low. Returns are often attractive and constant regardless of market or economic downturns. Equity market neutral strategies often complement other investment strategies, providing a balanced and diversified portfolio. </p>

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p>My friend and I have been at the sports wagering errr sports investing thing for several years.  I call it investing as we have been producing solid returns.  We just recently started a site to display our prowess.  I am responding as I have read this blog several times and think this idea possesses a lot of merit.  I would love the opportunity, as I have also been interested in becoming involved in the hedge fund arena.  However, I have noticed our returns have been better than most can produce in the securities markets.  My passion is to do nothing but invest in securities and sports and I have had success doing that, just trying to scratch up enough capital to get a start at doing this for a living.</p>
<p>I decided awhile ago that this is my goal and am in the process of getting there, its just it takes a fair amount of capital to strike out on your own and have no other source of income.  I have found out the things that I am good at in life and they are sports investing and securities trading.</p>
<p>An example of my securities success is I have recently been investing in an uncovered area of the commodities market.  There is a commodity named molybdenum that is used in steel and is used due to its anti corrosive properties.  This commodity is in the sweet spot of macro-economic trends.  This commodity will be increasingly used for oil pipelines and nuclear reactors as well as steel products in general.  With the developing countires increasing their appetite for products and the world\&#8217;s growing need for energy this is in the sweetspot.  Further, molybdenum has been under mined as prices plummeted to about the $3 level in 2001 now this commodity has been trending upward as demand is increasing and the supply is not there to meet the demand.  Prices are now in the $25 range and should only go higher, couple that with the fact that China has reduced their export of Molybdenum and you have a classic imbalance of supply and demand.  There are several ways to play this, my choice are small miners (I played it with a small miner named Idaho General Mines (GMO) as they should be supplying about 8% of the world\&#8217;s supply from their mine in late 2009-2010 Q1).  </p>
<p>Anyway, back to sports investing.  My friend and i had a documented record of 52-24 in NCAA football over the last two years playing selectively on NCAA games only when everything lined up to make these solid selections.  We have produced a winning percentage in NFL the last two years, somewhere in the upper 50 percent range (sorry do not have my records in front of me at the moment).  We won 59 units in MLB last year.  We are currently hitting at a 55% rate in NBA this year.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I love this idea and know it can work quite well financially.  Further, I would love the opportunity to discuss with you why my friend and I could provide you with winning returns over the long haul in this most unique and ambitious endeavor.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Kenny</p>

		<p>I know this article is relatively old, but I was looking online to see if there were any stocks of a company I could buy on any exchange in the world that uses its fund soley for professional sports betting, and as a result came across this article.</p>
<p>Well, I\&#8217;m quite certain if you were to open a fund that used its money solely for sports betting and if you hired the right people, I don\&#8217;t see how you can not turn a profit. The reason I say this is because you will notice that a lot of professional sports gamblers in fact really do make good profits year after year. In fact I started betting in 2001 and now I just do it for a living. In fact a bunch of friends I know give me a large sum of money to invest and for the past 2 years, I\&#8217;ve been able to double their money. Realistically and very conservatively you can expect 40-50% ROI. </p>
<p>In a sense this is like running my own  private fund, and in the fund I have 3 categories all based on risk preference:<br />1) Low risk &#8211; a strategy that implements always only betting 5% of my bankroll (Has been able to achieve 100% ROI over the past 2 years)<br />2) Medium risk &#8211; This is based on the theory of my low risk category, with the occasional plays that would warrant a higher wager based on strength of play.<br />3) High risk &#8211; Guess the title speaks for itself, but you can make a lot or lose a lot with this fund. (It\&#8217;s more to have fun but has done extremely well this year)</p>
<p>Now I wager on 4 Sports primarily<br />1) NBA<br />2) NFL<br />3) Soccer<br />4) Tennis</p>
<p>But the funds I mentioned above are based solely on NBA, which is what I\&#8217;m comfortable with.</p>
<p>Having said all that and given my experience, I have no doubt in my mind that a Sports Betting Fund would be highly successful as you know it will outperform the market and most other investments, and with good money management I see very little chance of things going bad. Hiring the right talent would be key obviously.</p>
<p>I hope your still looking into this (unless the fund is already open) as you can be sure I\&#8217;d invest a huge amount into this fund, as I believe it is relatively safe with high returns if done right.</p>
<p>Just wanted to offer my thoughts and experiences.</p>

		<p>Mark &#8212; I am currently working on the same idea.  The sky is the limit on this one.  I would be first in line to work with you on this.  My expertise is in NCAA Football.  It always takes Vegas a few weeks to catch up on the 119 teams in 1-A ball.  Most of Vegas\&#8217; time an effort is in handicapping the NFL.  Anyway, please let me know how I can apply for a position with you.  My education includes a BS in Engineering and an MBA in Finance.  Work experience includes coaching at the 1-A level and working as an analyst for a growth fund.  I could also go as far as saying that if I don\&#8217;t beat the S&#038;P or Dow you don\&#8217;t have to pay me.  Lets do it!</p>

		<p>Mark actually did go with a reputable handicapper and turned his initial investment into well over five times its original value. This is great and this is why I\&#8217;m have been in this business since 1971. I think this very public experiment proves<br />once again that professional handicappers arent nearly the hucksters or practitioners of black magic that theyre portrayed as. Its simply hard<br />work, mathematics, and knowing more than the general public. Just like broking. Sports betting as a legitimate moneymaking venture is not only much more enjoyable and entertaining than playing market, but it can return higher dividends and is more fluid than stocks and bonds. If youre willing<br />to go at it over the long haul, Im telling you, this can be a great income supplement and a really fun way to make money. It has been for me. I dont<br />recall who it was that Cuban used, but I would love for him to try our service at no cost to him or his readers for a period of time.  Please get in touch if intersted.</p>

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p>Your idea is soon to become reality, i just think you was a couple of years ahead of your time when you first published it.</p>
<p>Betting on sports, or a sport, which you know in so much intimate detail, will always bring a high win to loss ratio.</p>
<p>Just as the market forms its price about stocks, so the handicappers at the sportsbooks form their prices based on information they have to hand at that particular time. </p>
<p>Further to that, the prices will then move with weight of money&#8230; and here the imperfections of market information will manifest themselves, as you called it there is less smart money, than stupid money, and as such the smart money will take incorrect prices all day long.</p>
<p>50 Billion pounds sterling will be traded on soccer in the UK this season. There is a massive opportunity in the marketplace for a fund which can break down prices issued by handicappers and rebuilt with inhouse mathematical modelling and informational resources. This will lead to one or 2 investments per week which should lead to potentially explosive returns over the course of the soccer season.</p>
<p>Given conventional hedge funds were returning 25% in a good year, i think soccer will yield 35% plus.</p>
<p>I am currently in the throws of setting up my UK Soccer Trading fund, and I will keep you all posted when I launch. Suffice to say that the sports fund era has finally arrived.</p>

		<p>With the trades and acquisitions made going into the draft, plus the bulk of the team that is carried over from last season, and the trades and draft picks made during the draft, it sure seems like the Pats are going to be the team to beat in the AFC this season, and perhaps in all of the NFL.</p>
<p>Considering the Pats were almost in the Superbowl last season with a pathetic receiving corps and that they\&#8217;ve added very talented players into said receiving corps this season, barring some nasty injury(ies), they look to be the team to take it all.I say injury(ies) because I think they could survive an injury or two to some positions, but if they lost Brady they\&#8217;d probably have a hard time recovering.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that the Redskins did well in the draft and/or in free agency but so many holes still exist that I\&#8217;m not sure they\&#8217;ll be significantly better than last season.  I suppose on face they should be if they can keep their corners healthy.  With Landry (argh, hard to type that name as a Redskin!!) back there with a healthy secondary they might be able to cheat up more and put more pressure on opposing QBs.  Might.</p>
<p>They still have what should be a lot of talent in the receiving positions, and Campbell should be better, but they don\&#8217;t have the quality on either line (offense or defense) that I wish they\&#8217;d have, so it could be yet another year of .500 at best, or worse.</p>
<p>Still, the NFC East looks to be the NFC Least again this season.  None of the teams there look like they\&#8217;ll be that good, and none really look ready to step up and take the division.</p>
