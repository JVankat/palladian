              <B>For starters, can you please give me a brief overview of what 
              the crew is going to do on the mission? What's it all about? And, 
              explain the goals of the mission.</B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> As you know, 
              ours is a research science mission. And, it's dual shift to top 
              that. It's the first flight of the Research Double Module from Spacehab. 
              We'll be conducting basically 16 days' worth of microgravity research 
              in two shifts a day. So, that's 16 hours plus of work every day. 
              We have experiments from lots of different areas. There are experiments 
              from Earth sciences, physical sciences, and life sciences. And, 
              in all these three areas, there are a number of very interesting 
              experiments. For example in Earth sciences, we have a payload from 
              Israel, which is the MEIDEX (Mediterranean Dust Experiment from 
              Israel) where we are going to be studying aerosols and dust particles 
              over Earth. Mostly over the Mediterranean, so that there can be 
              some validation done of ground-based studies at the same times. 
              But, if there's a dust storm during our flight, any place on Earth, 
              then there would be a request made to do MEIDEX experiments on orbit. 
              And, the purpose is so that we can do climactic studies better than 
              we can right now. So, in the Earth sciences area, there's also another 
              experiment called SOLSE. SOLSE is going to study the ozone distribution 
              in the vertical over the Earth's atmosphere. As you know, the ozone 
              distribution is very closely tied to the health of our planet, so 
              it's very crucial to understand if it changes over time, and how 
              much it changes, and what the causes are. Along with this, there 
              is another experiment, which is in our payload bay, which is going 
              to measure the solar constant. And, again, the idea is to relate 
              that to the study of climate in Earth. That's probably [the] bulk 
              of the experiments which are tied to Earth sciences or climactic 
              studies. The second area, which is very exciting to me personally 
              (because it ties to some of my background), is physical sciences. 
              In there, we have studies from a wide area of research in materials. 
              For example, crystal growth under the umbrella of Zeolite Crystal 
              Growth Experiment. There's another one called Mechanics of Granular 
              Materials, where we're trying to study how liquefaction of sands 
              in coastal areas can have an impact on buildings and structures, 
              especially during earthquakes. In the same area, we have [a] combustion 
              module that we are carrying on board. It's a very large facility. 
              And, in this particular module, we're going to carry out three different 
              experiments to study flames of different varieties. And, we can 
              talk about that at length a bit later. So this is the physical sciences 
              area. And, there's tons more experiments. Finally, a lot of study's 
              being done in the third area, the life sciences area. There are 
              experiments from Johnson Space Center, from the European Space Agency               and literally from tens of thousands of researchers and students 
              across the world. In this latter category, we have experiments in 
              protein crystal growth. In protein crystal growth, all these different 
              researchers, they are trying to aim at growing bigger protein crystals 
              so that you can characterize what a particular protein looks like. 
              And, once you know that, you can have better ways of coming up with 
              countermeasures for the bad proteins they are tied to, for example, 
              some disease. We have four different lockers in which we have anywhere 
              from 200 to a thousand experiments within each locker. And, within 
              each locker, for example, 10 of the experiments might be sponsored 
              by one pharmaceutical company. Another 10 might be sponsored by 
              another research organization. And, so on. So, it's really totally 
              incredible the amount of participation that's there in the protein 
              crystal growth experiments in the life sciences area. The other 
              experiments are trying to get a better handle of human physiology 
              in space by studying either humans (four of our crewmembers are 
              actually going to be participating in detailed measurements of certain 
              aspects of human biology) or, in some cases, we are studying some 
              other life forms to understand [the] effect of microgravity on those 
              life forms. And, then later try to determine how these are tied 
              to human physiology. Besides these three very wide areas, there 
              are a lot of experiments which are in the education area. Students 
              are flying these experiments. And, finally, I'd just like to add, 
              there are a few experiments which are tied to Space Station so that 
              these technologies can be used on Space Station. We are going to 
              fly them on our flight, and later they can be used on the Space 
              Station.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6633">And, 
              there are a multitude of experiments. And, you've touched on some 
              of them. And most of these experiments have goals or purposes. But, 
              is there, in a nutshell, an overall goal of the mission for NASA? 
              Why is NASA flying the mission? Is there an overall goal?</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> The overall 
              objective of flying all of these experiments is basically to, in 
              some cases, simply to understand. In some cases, to better understand 
              processes. Be it physical processes; be it processes in the area 
              of Earth sciences (how climate works). Be it life sciences, where 
              we are trying to figure out proteins, for example which are tied 
              to human life so closely - what their structure is - so we can come 
              up with a better idea of how the proteins work, period. And then, 
              figure out how they interact. So, the overall objective, in a nutshell, 
              it would be fair to say is: to try to understand or better understand 
              physical processes on Earth, be they in the area of life sciences 
              or materials or climate. </FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" COLOR="#CC6633" SIZE="-1"><B>Can 
              you give some insight into why we need to go to space to conduct 
              some of the same research that's being conducted on Earth? Basically, 
              what importance does microgravity have on these experiments, and 
              what advantages does microgravity offer for them?</B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> Sure. Really, 
              we go to space for two reasons. Sometimes we get [a] better advantage 
              because there's [a] microgravity environment. In that case, we are 
              basically trying to do a few things. For example there are certain 
              things on Earth which are very complex, very closely tied processes. 
              For example turbulence on Earth is very closely tied to soot formation 
              in flames. Since these two things are so closely tied and they are 
              both very complex things, it's very hard on Earth to decouple them 
              to understand why is this thing happening? Is this because of turbulence? 
              Is this because of soot formation? So, we try to go to space so 
              we can decouple the effect of gravity out of some of the equations. 
              So the equation set or the governing principles for a process can 
              be made simpler. So, we can say: This will process. In the absence 
              of gravity, this is how it works. And then, we can try to understand: 
              Okay, if we add gravity to it, that's when these other things happen. 
              A simple example: there might be, for example, on Earth when you 
              are mixing two things (like oil and vinegar) and they separate. 
              So, if you're trying to make a material out of these two things, 
              you are forever having to indulge in a very active process of mixing 
              these together. And, it causes a new physics to happen because you 
              are mixing these two things. So, there's a swirling motion involved 
              now. How does that impact the upcoming material? You go to space, 
              and the two things are just dispersed into each other. And so, the 
              effect of gravity or the absence of gravity then helps to make the 
              process simpler and, therefore, helps us understand the physics 
              better. In the same vein, the second thing is that crystals, which 
              is a very important field that we have carried into microgravity, 
              in the absence of gravity, you can grow bigger crystals. It does 
              not matter what kind of crystals they are; you can simply grow them 
              bigger. If you can grow them bigger, it helps you characterize the 
              behavior. Not really the behavior. The structure of these crystals. 
              In materials, it's very important to know what the structure of 
              this crystal is so you can figure out when it mixes with something 
              else what's going to happen. In life sciences, in protein crystals, 
              if you can understand what the structure of this crystal is, that 
              leads you to forming the key on how to make this particular protein 
              mate with another protein. So those are the areas where you can 
              help remove gravity and then do better in microgravity. The second 
              reason, which is really totally different, is that in space, you 
              are going to go study, for example, the one experiment I mentioned, 
              the ozone distribution. This is just a better vantage point. You 
              are above the Earth's atmosphere. You are trying to look at the 
              limb, and so you can see what's going on in ozone distribution in 
              the vertical layer of our atmosphere. We are not doing astronomy 
              experiments. But, you've heard, there are lots of space shuttle 
              missions dedicated to doing astronomy experiments. And, once again, 
              you are going to space not necessarily for microgravity but it gives 
              you a better vantage point, better seeing, for example.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6633">Some 
              people may be expecting the research on this mission to yield immediate 
              solutions to problems or to theories or whatever. But that's not 
              necessarily [the] case. Can you explain and describe, for someone 
              who's not a scientist and not involved in scientific research, what 
              the place of research is and the scientific problem-solving process 
              or theory-proving process?</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> It's actually 
              quite surprising that generally, when we are carrying out research, 
              how we do it in a very formed manner where we know in stage one 
              we are going to study certain parameters and their effect on certain 
              processes. In doing so, sometimes we validate our assumptions, and 
              sometimes we learn new lessons. And, our assumptions, we find out, 
              were not correct. So, we go on to the next step and so on. In microgravity 
              research, [a] lot of times in the early Eighties, for example, the 
              assumptions we had made were not all true. Sometimes we thought 
              simply going to microgravity would allow us to make better materials 
              because of the absence of buoyancy-driven connection. But, we found 
              in space, there is another type of connection, which starts to play 
              a more dominant role. So, we are learning. It does not mean that 
              we don't go to the third step, which is, "Okay, now. We know this 
              is the reason this thing is not working in space. How do we overcome 
              that?" Then, we try to find out how to overcome that. And, so the 
              real process happens in stages. You go through the first stage, 
              and the second stage, and so on. It's not really true that all of 
              the experiments have this tough path at this stage in the ballgame 
              of spaceflight research because as you know, this particular mission 
              is the first commercial flight of Double Research Module. So, there 
              are a lot of experiments which are actually sponsored by commercial 
              companies which, given the benefit of past research, are now looking 
              for quicker return on what they are doing. Some areas that I could 
              mention along these lines are, for example, the Zeolite Crystal 
              Growth payload, where the investigators and the researchers are 
              trying to come up with materials, these are advanced materials which 
              can be used to, for example, store hydrogen at room temperature. 
              Why would you want to do that? So that you can use hydrogen as a 
              fuel as opposed to using things that we use as fuel today for street 
              vehicles. It's very hard to store hydrogen at room temperatures. 
              But, these advanced materials have these capabilities that hydrogen 
              just stays mated to the material. There are a number of materials 
              in this category. For example, better dye retention on pictures 
              - as in photography or newspapers. The print being held to the paper 
              with the dye better than it does today, so that it stays there over 
              a longer period of time. All of these experiments in the zeolite 
              area are actually sponsored by commercial partners. And, they are 
              actually looking for a quick return so that, when these materials 
              are made they bring them back, look at the crystals and then try 
              to figure out which particular material could have been added in 
              the higher proportion to get the effect that they were really seeking. 
              Likewise in the protein crystal area, the pharmaceutical companies 
              that are participating are looking for quicker returns than the 
              conventional way we look at science, which is sometimes just thinking 
              it's for better understanding. So I would say we have experiments 
              in both varieties at this stage in spaceflight research due to the 
              past benefits of all the research that has been done. Be it, for 
              example, the Zeolite crystals or the protein crystals for pharmaceutical 
              companies.</FONT></P>

              mentioned the dual work shift. Can you talk a little bit about what 
              that is? And, why it's necessary on this mission?</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> We are a dual-shift 
              mission because the extent of science, the experiments we are carrying, 
              is just very, very large. There is simply no way to carry out that 
              kind of science with just one shift. You might say, if we have seven 
              people on one shift, they could just divvy up the experiments and, 
              hence, you should be able to do the same number of things. The issue 
              is that on our Orbiter, there are lots of attitude requirements. 
              The Orbiter should be in a certain attitude to do, for example, 
              the ozone measurements. In a different attitude to do, for example, 
              the dust measurements. In a free-drift attitude, meaning that no 
              jets should be firing and it's just drifting (hence the word free 
              drift) to do some of our very microgravity-sensitive experiments. 
              For example, one of the combustion module experiments needs a very 
              quiescent environment. So, because of these very extensive requirements 
              on what sort of attitude the Orbiter should be in, and what kind 
              of microgravity environment is required, you sort of need to take 
              advantage of the whole day. And it really helps to use the crew 
              much more efficiently by doing that.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6633">The 
              research on this mission spans a wide range of origins. It originates 
              from various parts of the world. Some of those places the crew has 
              visited to familiarize yourselves with the experiments. Can you 
              give us some insight into your thoughts about what it's like to 
              be on a mission like this, that's not only fostering a continued 
              awareness of other parts of the world, but helping those parts of 
              the world maybe solve some of the problems that they may be encountering 
              and the benefits they maybe could reap from this mission?</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> Yeah, it's 
              indeed true that on our mission there are experiments from all over. 
              It really surprises me even now that when we look at for a particular 
              experiment or payload on our flight, how many different researchers 
              are participating to get things done. I think it's the nature of 
              world economics at present where there are extensive collaborations 
              amongst partner countries to come up with better technologies. And 
              they do share these technologies with each other. For example in 
              the protein crystal growth experiment the number of researchers 
              is literally in thousands. And, they are collaborating with each 
              other, with their ideas on how better to do these experiments. And 
              the benefits in an area like this are really to all of the humanity. 
              Because if you find out something better in that area, that's obviously 
              going to benefit us all. Another area which really stands out, we 
              have some experiments which sit in the payload bay which are looking 
              at technologies for heat rejection for spacecraft. You know we fly 
              satellites in space vehicles, and they produce heat. And, one of 
              the big technical impediments out there is how to reject heat and 
              stay healthy in space. So there are three different ideas on technologies 
              on how best to reject heat from three different countries in Europe. 
              The really good thing is: when the results come back, you can really 
              say how these technologies work, which one is better for certain 
              areas or certain environments in space. For example, you are always 
              looking at the Sun versus always looking at Earth. But in the end, 
              the benefits are really had by all.</FONT></P>

              these processes and then be able to use the benefits that come out

              of these people might be having. But in this room, these six scientists 
              from six different countries are together. And, they are trying 
              to do something which is totally mind-boggling. And, to sit with

            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> I am very 
              excited to serve as the Flight Engineer on the flight. On ascent 
              the flight deck crew is basically monitoring the systems. Flight 
              Engineer's job is to make sure all systems are working nominally 
              by glancing at the different meters and displays in an organized 
              fashion and to diagnose malfunctions, if any, respond to those malfunctions, 
              and help the Commander and Pilot execute their procedures if there 
              is a malfunction. And then, to sort of have a big picture: If there's 
              a malfunction, how does it impact us? A minute from now? Five minutes 
              from now? And, so on. Before we have main engine cutoff versus after 
              we have main engine cutoff. So for ascent and entry, basically that's 
              the role I serve in. On orbit as Flight Engineer we get daily uplinks, 
              in case of systems not working nominally if we have to deorbit then 
              what particular information bits and pieces we can use to determine 
              at what time we should do the deorbit burn, which landing sites 
              are available to us, etc. We get this information every day. So, 
              we process it on board so we know, at all times, that these are 
              the paths we have open to us. As a crew, we spend a fair amount 
              of time in our ascent and entry simulators training for these sort 
              of tasks. Besides the Flight Engineer duties as you know, this mission 
              is dedicated to research science. And, all of us - all seven of 
              us - basically are very busy and timelined to the full extent to 
              carry out research every day. So basically during our wake-up hours, 
              we are busy doing the experiments that we are timelined to do. So 
              day after day, different experiments; that's what we do.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6633">And 
              that starts shortly after you guys reach orbit. Can you tell us

              the modules, when that starts? And explain what you and your crewmates 
              will be doing at that point in the flight.</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">The main engines 
              shut off just 8� minutes after launch. And after that, basically 
              the whole crew is working to get the Orbiter ready for orbit. The 
              flight deck crew is busy working to target the OMS burn we do to 
              get to orbit. And the middeck crew is busy trying to get switches 
              and systems in [the] right order so that in that upcoming phase 
              of flight, everything is [as] it's supposed to be. About two hours 
              into our mission, Laurel Clark and Ilan Ramon, my crewmates, are 
              ready to open the hatch to Spacehab and start activating the Spacehab 
              systems. Both of those crewmembers - Ilan and Laurel - are from 
              the Red Shift. Red shift is the same shift I am on and Commander 
              Rick Husband is on. Four of us will work the longer day when we 
              get on orbit. We are the wake-up crew, you might say. The other 
              shift, the Blue Shift - which is our Pilot Willie McCool, David 
              Brown, Mission Specialist, and Mike Anderson, who's our Payload 
              Commander - three of them basically, after helping out with trying 
              to get the Orbiter in [the] right configuration for the early period 
              of the mission, we have to make sure they can go to sleep so that 
              when we go to sleep, it's time for them to wake up. We basically 
              share the same sleep stations, so we have to get them up so we can 
              go to sleep. And then they can take the helm of the ship and start 
              working the science experiments, etc. So after two hours, we basically 
              start to think that four of us, on the Red Shift, really need to 
              get Spacehab and the Orbiter working for rest of the mission. Willie 
              McCool from the Blue Shift would help set up our laptop network 
              in that early period. Dave Brown would help activate the FREESTAR 
              experiment, which is back in the payload bay. Ilan and Laurel, as 
              I mentioned, activate Spacehab. I work with the Commander for the 
              first half-hour or so of that later period to get our computers 
              (the Orbiter computers) in the right configuration for on-orbit 
              operations. And then shortly thereafter I work with Laurel and Ilan. 
              And, my job is to activate a number of experiments, which are in 
              the Research Double Module. Shortly thereafter, three of us (Ilan, 
              myself, and Laurel), we are working on different parts of Spacehab, 
              setting up equipment for experiments that we're going to be doing. 
              I'm doing the video setup with a number of boxes, so we can give 
              video downlink to ground for the experiments that do need to send 
              video downlink. We start to deploy equipment in Spacehab. Our computers, 
              cameras, equipment that we need for housekeeping, our Flight Data 
              File (the procedure books that we need to use to carry out any of 
              the procedures). So, the first day is very busy, basically, in getting 
              experiments started which are mostly passive. Where we just have 
              to turn them on, or some experiments where we need to do a setup 
              so we can perform them in the upcoming hours. And then, all of the 
              housekeeping tasks- be it deploying the laptops, the network of 
              laptops, the video equipment, and so on</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1">.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6633">Talk 
              a little bit about some of the operation and the purpose of some 
              of the specific experiments that you're going to be working with. 
              We touched a little bit on MEIDEX before (the Mediterranean Israeli 
              Test Experiment). Can you give us a little bit of insight into the 
              operation of the process? How it operates and a little bit more 
              about what it's for and what it does.</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> The MEIDEX 
              experiment is sponsored by Israel, as you know, is basically looking 
              at aerosols and dust particles in Earth's atmosphere. It does that 
              by using special cameras, which are mounted in the payload bay. 
              For part of the mission, our goal is to look at these aerosols and 
              dust particles in conjunction with ground. So, people on ground 
              can also look at [the] same dust particles and aerosols so we can 
              validate the information from space with information from ground. 
              We would also be looking at dust particles and aerosols during [the] 
              rest of our mission when ground cannot necessarily look at these 
              particles. And at that time, we can use the knowledge that we would 
              have gained by having done the validation for simultaneous studies. 
              The main purpose for studying aerosols and dust particles is because 
              they play a big role in how climate works. And climate is a very 
              global topic. It's not: if climate in U.S. is bad, it doesn't really 
              matter because it just affects us and nobody else. Bad climate or 
              bad emissions of particles anywhere on Earth would ultimately impact 
              us all. And in fact the impact happens in a very short duration 
              of time. It's not something we can ignore by saying, "Oh, this is 
              a problem that's not worthy of our immediate attention." Within 
              the MEIDEX experiment, perhaps one of the intriguing and very captivating 
              studies is study of sprites. Which is, when there are lightning 
              storms we've observed with certain aircraft that there's upward 
              emitting lightning. Long time ago, if people were flying an aircraft 
              and they observed this, nobody would want to believe. It's, you 
              know, you are [imagining] these things. But, over time, people have 
              come to understand that this is real. Though we don't really understand 
              how it works, the physics behind it. This particular experiment, 
              study of sprites, when there are lightning storms, has captivated 
              the imagination of tens of researchers on ground. So, even though 
              it's a secondary experiment on MEIDEX a lot of researchers on ground 
              have found out about it and now they are participating with ground 
              studies simultaneous with the space shuttle studies. Again to correlate 
              data. So, if you see it from above, what information [do] you get? 
              And, the same information and looked from below means what? For 
              better understanding of how it might work. Tied with sprites [are] 
              blue jets, a similar phenomenon related to lightning. So, there 
              are all these very neat, interesting concepts in climate which are 
              secondary objectives which a lot of researchers are now participating 
              in. Our on-orbit operations basically mean that we give commands 
              to the cameras, which are in the payload bay. Using computers, we 
              type out the commands and direct these cameras to look in the right 
              region. The space shuttle, by that time, is already in [the] correct 
              attitude. It's looking at Earth at places where it ought to be looking 
              at for studying dust particles, aerosols, or sprites, which would 
              mean a slightly different attitude. And we would collect video data 
              from the cameras and send it to ground for analysis, real time. 
              Which is delayed by about a day. And, also later after the mission. 
              In the MEIDEX experiment, there are ground studies planned where 
              the Tel Aviv University in conjunction with a number of other research 
              organizations is planning to fly small aircraft, which are fully 
              instrumented; and they will fly these pre-designed trajectories 
              through the region where there is dust and aerosols. For example, 
              going in one direction and then the other direction for specified 
              durations of time with the specified increments in altitude so that 
              they have a very good idea of how these things are distributed. 
              Of course, something like that on Earth, they are unable to do everywhere 
              on Earth. So, the region where this is to be done is very limited. 
              The space shuttle-based studies will definitely include the regions 
              where ground studies are being done so we can have a good correlation. 
              But, the space shuttle will also study other regions on Earth where 
              there is dust. For example, if there's a big dust storm during our 
              mission, then more than likely we would be asked to do MEIDEX studies 
              for that. It's quite probable that the dust storm is over a region 
              where the aircraft studies cannot be done, because it's very remote. 
              For that particular case, the idea is to use the knowledge gained 
              from the region where we have the ability to validate space-based 
              study with Earth-based aircraft study. So, both of these aspects 
              are going to be carried out.</FONT></P>

              is a bad thing on Earth. A lot of people die from soot inhalation. 
              The second one is to understand the leanest mixture settings at 
              which we can burn a fuel, and this is to understand fuel efficiency 
              better. And, [the] third one is how to extinguish fires using nontoxic 
              materials. Because right now, most of our fire suppression technologies 
              use materials which are not very good for us. So, we get rid of 
              the fire, then we are unable to enter the same area for a while. 
              So, this third experiment actually uses water droplets to extinguish 
              fires. And, it could have potential uses later on - on Earth, of 
              course, and also in space; for example, the space station to take 
              care of any problems that might arise.</FONT></P>

              talk a little bit about the operation of those experiments. Earlier 
              you were talking about the mist experiment. How does that operate? 
              What will the crew be doing during that experiment?</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> All three 
              combustion module experiments are very hands-on and obviously a 
              lot of fun for [the] operator to work with. Let's use, for example, 
              the MIST experiment. What we do in this telephone booth-size or 
              family refrigerator-size module that we have: we can insert the 
              experiment, which is sort of like the size of a big microwave oven, 
              inside this module. The experiment itself has hardware where there 
              is a little camera to monitor what's going on; a little capacitor, 
              which is charged with water so it can spray water droplets; it can 
              inject them at different sizes; we can control, to a degree, the 
              speed at which the droplets are injected. So, the experiment itself 
              is a self-contained unit. We take it out from the storage location, 
              insert it inside the big module. There are some large cables that 
              we hook up. A big cable to supply power to the experiment, a cable 
              for data so that data that is being collected can be brought out 
              via a laptop and then sent to ground for real-time analysis (in 
              this case), and also video information is coming out from the experiment 
              which is again rerouted to us and to ground for real-time recording 
              and real-time downlink. We do the experiment setup a few times. 
              We insert it in the module. We might have to do it again to, for 
              example, change the little unit which controls the size of droplets. 
              But once it's inside, we can carry on, for example, 12 different 
              studies where we are looking at the effect of different parameters 
              on the flame. So, part of the experiment will help generate a flame. 
              We have a little laptop, using which we control when things happen. 
              The flame gets generated, and then the water particles or the water 
              mist gets injected onto the flame. All of this is captured on video 
              and data, which is recorded and seen real time and downlinked real 
              time. After the experiment is done, a little later we'll start with 
              the second parametric study where we are varying something else 
              and carry on the same test run yet again. So, to give you a certain 
              idea: In MIST, for example, we do 36 different parametric studies, 
              which basically are done one after another. Some of these are, actually 
              a large number of these are, commanded by ground. After we get the 
              setup done [the] first time and make sure that the first study is 
              correct and things are now going smoothly, then ground can take 
              over and do rest of the studies.</FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> <B><FONT COLOR="#CC6633">And, 
              another experiment to be conducted within that module is SOFBALL 
              or Structures of Flame Balls at Low Lewis Numbers. Can you tell 
              us a little bit about the operation of that?</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> SOFBALL is 
              actually a very exciting study. And, it perhaps is one which has 
              its basis more in theory than the other experiments. So, those people 
              who are into theoretical chemistry would love the genesis of this 
              particular experiment. Long time ago, there's this Russian scientist, 
              Zeldovich and he figured out, just by looking at the equations, 
              [that] if you did not have gravity, then you should be able to get 
              flame balls rather than regular flames. And, this would happen if 
              you are burning a mixture at its leanest setting. Meaning the fuel 
              composition is very, very low. When we say a mixture is rich, we 
              mean there's lot of fuel. Leaner setting meaning: the smallest amount 
              of fuel that will support combustion. So, he predicted that, and 
              that was the end of story. It's just written in books. And then, 
              lo and behold, there's this professor at University of California, 
              Dr. Ronney, and he has been involved with combustion studies for 
              a while and does drop tower tests. Where you come up with little 
              combustion experiments which are dropped in these big towers that 
              you might have heard of and then you get less than a second worth 
              of science study out of these. And, it's all videotaped. And, you 
              break it, frame by frame, and see what happened. And in one of these 
              studies, he discovered there were flame balls. And, he was just 
              totally amazed that much has happened in other areas where Einstein, 
              for example, predicted bending of light and much, much later it 
              was validated. Similarly this was predicted lots of years before 
              [it was] seen by Ronney, and then he came up with the idea of validating 
              it in space. With the potential benefit, again, you should always 
              be tied to something in real life, that if we can understand that 
              flame balls really work, then this can help us better understand 
              combustion modeling. Combustion modeling is one of the toughest 
              fields out there where we are still trying to figure out, based 
              on just theory and equations, that: If I solve this problem on computer, 
              can I get the real result? And, of course, any time we can do that, 
              we save a lot of resources, as has been shown, for example, in the 
              area of aircraft design. You know, commercial companies routinely 
              now use aerodynamics modeling to come up with aircraft design. In 
              the case of combustion modeling, we have been really lacking because 
              it's a very complex field, and we are unable to tie all the things 
              together. So, if we can understand this yet one simple component 
              of this whole equation and see how it works, it helps us get one 
              step further. So, as I mentioned, this experiment has flown once 
              before. A lot of very interesting parametric studies are planned 
              for our flight because Professor Ronney's better able to predict 
              that these flame balls should be able to last for a matter of hours. 
              And, the Orbiter will be in free drift during those times to minimize 
              any disturbances from jet firings, for example. And then, collect 
              video data, temperature data, and tie it to the modeling equations. 
              I think this should prove to be very interesting.</FONT></P>

              third experiment within that module that you've touched on already: 
              LSP Laminar Soot Process. Can you briefly explain the operation 
              of that experiment?</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> Laminar Soot 
              experiment, much like the MIST and SOFBALL experiment, has its own 
              experiment module that, as far as we are concerned, will integrate 
              it- the microwave oven-size module- inside the bigger refrigerator-size 
              module, connect the cables so that commands can flow in, data can 
              come out, power can go in, etc. Once we've done that, the experiment 
              is basically looking at flames and looking at the limit of flame 
              where soot is formed. Soot is collected in these collection banks, 
              they call, and temperature data is collected real time. All of this 
              is to be looked at later on based on the assumptions the scientists 
              have. By having these 12 parameters, we'll be able to tell how this 
              thing works. Why are we studying soot in space? Or what's the benefit? 
              Or, why is there a need to do this in space? It's because, on Earth, 
              soot is generally produced by turbulent flames. Turbulence and soot, 
              which is combustion chemistry, are two of the most complicated fields. 
              It's almost impossible to solve the equations or model them so that 
              you have both of these players in. It would be really very nice 
              if one of these can be chucked out. Well, if you throw away soot, 
              then you cannot study soot. If you throw away turbulence, then how 
              do you study soot? Because turbulence is the process behind it. 
              We do know, though, that laminar diffusion flames, which are very 
              similar to turbulent flames (they mimic all of their characteristics), 
              also cause soot. But, where do we generate laminar diffusion place, 
              flames? Only place to do that is in microgravity. Hence, going to 
              space. So, you go to space, use microgravity to dissociate turbulence 
              from the equation so that you just have laminar diffusion flames, 
              which mimic everything that the turbulent flame was doing yet does 
              not have the complicated math behind it, yet generates soot. So, 
              that's the reason of going to space with this experiment. So, like 
              I said before, the potential is twofold. One, of course, soot is 
              bad. It would really help to figure out what generates it and how 
              to eliminate. And second, besides that, any time we can model the 
              governing processes better than we can do today, we are better off. 
              Because now we know how this works. And, we can know the answer 
              in advance rather than doing the experiment and then figuring out, 
              "Oh, this is what happened."</FONT></P>

              What's the operation procedure?</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> The Mechanics 
              of Granular experiment is housed in the Spacehab Double Research 
              module. It sits kind of at the aft wall, has one big double locker 
              - a locker is size of a microwave, you might say - has big double 
              locker associated with it. What we have there is a test cell. The 
              test cell is about 18 inches long. It's triangular in its cross-section. 
              You can see through it. And, inside it, it has sand. When the test 
              cell is placed where it's supposed to be located inside the double 
              locker, there are three cameras, which can look at this test cell 
              from every direction. So, that allows you to see what's happening 
              to the sand inside the test cell. In addition, the sand in the test 
              cell is being pressurized by water. So, there's an accumulator. 
              It's filled with water. There's hardware out there to supply water 
              pressure onto the sand. So, what are we trying to do with it? The 
              objective is to understand the process behind liquefaction of sand 
              in coastal areas during, for example, earthquake. We want to study 
              this because we still do not understand what happens during earthquakes 
              when there are big buildings, which are sitting close to sandy areas. 
              And, we used to think that when well-packed, these materials, like 
              sand, should hold their structure and should be able to support 
              buildings and other structures (human-made structures). But, that's 
              not the case, as we've learned over time. And, it happens because 
              sand liquefies with water in there. And it starts to flow much like 
              a fluid, much like as if you did not even have a structure there 
              to support this building or bridge that you had put up. So, the 
              objective is to understand how does this liquefaction happen? What 
              sort of water pressures are you dealing with when liquefaction becomes 
              an issue? So you can know what is a good basis to go with, and where 
              is the threshold after which it's a bad idea? And, further, if you 
              were going to do reinforcements how should the sandy areas then 
              be contained by these reinforcements?</FONT></P>

              with it. And, [each] locker, as I mentioned, is size of a small 
              microwave oven, if you will. What we are doing in there is basically 
              growing cell tissue. On this particular flight, we are growing cell 
              tissue to better understand prostate cancer. The cell tissue is 
              inside a circular chamber. There is media, which is being used to 
              help feed this cell tissue, so this tissue can grow bigger. And

              tissue can consume. So on orbit, we are doing operations where we 
              are making sure that new media bags (bags filled with nutrient) 
              are being fed to the cell tissue so it can grow. In addition, we 
              are looking at the chamber on a regular basis to make sure everything 
              is fine. The cells are growing bigger. The pH level, a litmus test 
              basically; the level of how acid the medium is - is correct, is 
              not too high, not too low. We do these checks on a daily basis. 
              In addition we take out some of the cell sample and some of the

              are correct and are as expected. And if not, then we'll have to

            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> When I was 
              going to high school back in India, growing up, I think I was very 
              lucky that we lived in a town which is a very small town and one 
              of a handful of towns at that time which had flying clubs. And, 
              we would see these small Pushpak airplanes, which are not much different 
              from Piper J3 Cubs that you see in the U.S. that students were flying 
              as part of their training programs. Me and my brother, sometimes 
              we would be on bikes looking up, which you shouldn't be doing, trying 
              to see where these airplanes were headed. Every once in a while, 
              we'd ask my dad if we could get a ride in one of these planes. And, 
              he did take us to the flying club and get us a ride in the Pushpak 
              and a glider that the flying club had. I think that's really my 
              closest link to aerospace engineering that I can dig deep down and 
              find out, out there. Also growing up, we knew of this person, J. 
              R. D. Tata in India, who had done some of the first mail flights 
              in India. And also the airplane that he flew for the mail flights 
              now hangs in one of the aerodromes out there that I had had a chance 
              to see. Seeing this airplane and just knowing what this person had 
              done during those years was very intriguing. Definitely captivated 
              my imagination. And, even when I was in high school if people asked 
              me what I wanted to do, I knew I wanted to be an aerospace engineer. 
              In hindsight, it's quite interesting to me that just some of those 
              very simple things helped me make up my mind that that's the area 
              I wanted to pursue. During our school year in India, we have to 
              figure out kind of early what particular subjects you want to pursue. 
              Basically when you are in eighth grade, around 12 years of age, 
              you have to pick up a track - whether you're going science (as in 
              engineering) or science (as in medical). And, that probably is the 
              earliest decision point when I said, "Since I'm going to do aerospace 
              engineering, I'm going to study physics, chemistry, and math." And 
              from then on, pretty much you are on a set track. And hoping, if, 
              you know, this is what you want to do, and if it doesn't come out 
              true that there are some other options that you have (which I did). 
              And after pre-engineering, which is equivalent of 12th grade in 
              US - by which time now you've been specializing in basically physics, 
              chemistry, and math and some language - you are ready to go to an 
              engineering college or another profession of your choice by taking 
              part in exams or simply answering questionnaires and based on merit 
              of your results. I was lucky to get into aerospace engineering at 
              Punjab Engineering College. And really in my case the goal was, 
              at that stage anyway, to be an aerospace engineer. The astronaut 
              business is really, really farfetched for me to say, "Oh, at that 
              time I even had an inkling of it." Aircraft design was really the 
              thing I wanted to pursue. If people asked me what I wanted to do, 
              I remember in the first year I would say, "I want to be a flight 
              engineer." But, I am quite sure at that time, I didn't really have 
              a good idea of what a flight engineer did. Because flight engineers 
              do not do aircraft design, which was an area I wanted to pursue 
              and did pursue in my career. And, it's sort of a nice coincident 
              that that's what I am doing on this flight.</FONT></P>

              you, or maybe still inspire you, to do what you're doing now?</FONT></B></FONT></P>
            <P><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="-1"> I think inspiration 
              and tied with it is motivation. For me, definitely, it comes every 
              day from people in all walks of life. It's easy for me to be motivated 
              and inspired by seeing somebody who just goes all out to do something. 
              For example, some of the teachers in high school. The amount of 
              effort they put in to carry out their courses. The extra time they 
              took to do experiments with us. And then, just the compliments they 
              gave students for coming up with ideas - new ideas - [that], in 
              hindsight, I wonder how they even had the patience to look at these. 
              In general during my life, I would say I've been inspired by explorers. 
              Different times during my life I've read books. More recently, say 
              about Shackleton, the four or five books written by people in more 
              recent times, and then during the expedition. And then some of the 
              incredible feats these people carried out; like making [it] to the 
              Pole almost, but making the wise decision to stop a hundred miles 
              short and return. Lewis and Clark's incredible journey across America 
              to find a route to water, if one existed. And, the perseverance 
              and incredible courage with which they carried it out. Patty Wagstaff. 
              You know, she started out kind of late flying aerobatic airplanes. 
              And then had the where-with-all to say that she was going to take 
              part in the championships. And then, became an unlimited U.S. champion 
              three times in a row. And, that's not men's or women's; that's The 
              Champion. There are so many people out there that just how they 
              have done some incredible things. And how they inspire. You know, 
              in explorers, Peter Matthiessen and how he has explored the whole 
              world and chronicled life, animals and birds as they exist. And, 
              he's done it by simply walking on his feet. You know, across [the] 
              Himalayas. Across Africa. When I read about these people, I think 
              the one thing that just stands out is their perseverance in how 
              they carried out what they wished to carry out.</FONT></P>
