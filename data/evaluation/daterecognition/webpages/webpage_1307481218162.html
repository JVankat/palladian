										<p class="textwhite8">As one of the pioneers of partnerships for the FBI, Dan Larkin of the FBI&rsquo;s Cyber Division will outline how the FBI has taken this concept from rhetoric to reality over the past 5 years. This presentation will explore how the mantra &ldquo;make it personal&rdquo; has aided the FBI in forging exceptional alliances with key stake holders from industry, academia and law enforcement both domestically and abroad. This presentation will also outline how such collaborations have helped to proactively advance the fight against an increasingly international and organized, cyber crime threat.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Dan Larkin became unit chief of the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which is a join initiative between the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) in January 2003. Before that he was a supervisory special agent (SSA) in the White Collar Crime area for ten years. In that capacity he supervised and coordinated numerous joint agency initiatives on both regional and national levels involving corruption and fraud associated with a variety of federal, state, and local agencies. SSA Larkin acted as the congressional investigative team leader in the &ldquo;Operation Illwind&rdquo; Pentagon scandal corruption investigation. The combined effort of this team led to record settlements and convictions involving numerous top defense contractors, as well as public officials.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Prior to his current assignment UC Larkin developed and supervised the High Tech Crimes Task Force in Western Pennsylvania, one of the first such initiatives in the United States. UC Larkin also developed a national initiative known as the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) This progressive initiative maximizes overlapping public/private sector resources, in identifying and proactively targeting escalating cyber-crime perpetrators both domestically and abroad. This project also serves to attract a perpetual stream of key Subject Matter Experts (SME's) from industry, government and academia, creating a dynamic cyber-nerve-center, for tactical and proactive response, forensics and vulnerability analysis, and the development of advanced training. UC Larkin also co-authored the FBI&rsquo;s re-organization plan in 2002 which established Cyber Crime as a top priority, and underscored the need for additional Public/Private Alliances in combating priority cyber crimes word-wide.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">Windows Vista comes with redesigned support for WiFi (802.11 wireless).&nbsp;For those of us who live with a laptop in easy reach, it&rsquo;s going to have an effect on our workday.&nbsp;For users there&rsquo;s a new UI experience, helpful diagnostics and updated default behaviors. For IT pros who manage Windows clients, there&rsquo;s improved management via Group Policy and Scripting. For sysadmins &amp; geeks there&rsquo;s a new command line interface.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">But behind these more obvious changes there&rsquo;s a new software stack.&nbsp;A stack designed to be more secure, but also more open and extensible. This talk will take a deep dive into that stack, describe the various components and their interaction and show where developers can create code to modify and extend the client.&nbsp;Want to build a site survey tool, a wireless IDS, or hack your own driver?&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll show where to plug in. We&rsquo;ll describe in detail how the behavior of the wireless stack has changed from XP, explain the rational behind this, and show how this is reflected in the user experience.&nbsp;Finally we&rsquo;ll look at how Microsoft tests WiFi in Windows Vista.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">This presentation will discuss the use of RSS and Atom feeds as method of delivering exploits to client systems. In our research we have found a number of RSS clients, both local and web-based, that are far too trusting of the content that is delivered via feeds. Although this content arrives as well-formed XML, fundamentally it originated as user input elsewhere. Like any such data, it can contain malicious and mal-formed content, yet many clients fail to guard against this. And though such content by definition originates remotely, many clients use methods of display that cause it to be trusted as if it were locally originated.&nbsp; </p>
										<p class="textwhite8">As RSS becomes more ubiquitous, the scope of this problem becomes worse. Many RSS feeds are machine generated from content originating in other feeds, search engine results, and so on. This means that feed subscribers can even be targeted without them actually subscribing to your feed at all. This has potential uses for worm propagation, botnet creation, and other forms of attack.</p>

But what about the volatile memory which contains a huge amount of useful information such as the content of clipboards or the SAM database? How long can volatile data stay in the main memory? What about anti-forensic methods of defeating disk forensic and incident response tools? Why is the content of the memory not dumped during the process of data collection from a suspicious computer? What is the best way to analyze the physical memory from Windows&reg; and Linux&reg; machines? Is it possible? I will answer these questions during my Black Hat presentation which is focused on methods of finding digital evidence in the physical memory of Windows and Linux machines.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">During the presentation, methods of investigations of the physical memory from a compromised machine will be discussed. Through these methods, it is possible to extract useful information from the memory such as the full content of .dll and .exe files, various caches like clipboards, detailed information about each process (e.g. owner, MAC times, content) and information about processes that were being executed and were terminated in the past. Also, methods of correlating page frames even from swap areas will be discussed. The techniques covered during the presentation will lead you through the process of analyzing important structures and recovering the content of files from the physical memory.&nbsp; As an integral part of the presentation, new ways of detecting hidden objects and methods of detecting kernel modification will be presented. These methods can be used to identify compromised machines and to detect malicious code such memory-resident rootkits or worms.&nbsp;</p>

This presentation focuses on the two weakest links in the current generation of intrusion detection solutions: application protocols and resource limitations. Complex protocols often have the most dangerous flaws, yet these protocols are barely supported by most intrusion detection engines. Like any other networking component, intrusion detection gear often has a &quot;fast path&quot; for normal traffic, and a &quot;slow path&quot; for handling exceptions. By seeking out and finding the &quot;slow path&quot;, an attacker can control the resource usage of the system and bypass nearly any state engine or signature.

While their high potential for automation makes them desirable, they frequently suffer from a lack of &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;.&nbsp;That is, the random nature of input space exploration makes the probability of discovering vulnerabilities highly non-deterministic. Black box inputs are similar to unguided missiles.&nbsp;In this talk, we will discuss how we might turn these inputs into guided missiles by intelligently driving their selection using ideas borrowed from probability theory and evolutionary biology.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">Imagine you&rsquo;re visiting a popular website and invisible JavaScript exploit code steals your cookies, captures your keystrokes, and monitors every web page that you visit. Then, without your knowledge or consent, your web browser is silently hijacked to transfer out bank funds, hack other websites, or post derogatory comments in a public forum. No traces, no tracks, no warning sirens. In 2005&rsquo;s &quot;Phishing with Superbait&quot; presentation we demonstrated that all these things were in fact possible using nothing more than some clever JavaScript. And as bad as things are already, further web application security research is revealing that outsiders can also use these hijacked browsers to exploit intranet websites.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Most of us assume while surfing the Web that we are protected by firewalls and isolated through private NAT'ed IP addresses. We assume the soft security of intranet websites and that the Web-based interfaces of routers, firewalls, printers, IP phones, payroll systems, etc. even if left unpatched, remain safe inside the protected zone. We believe nothing is capable of directly connecting in from the outside world. Right? Well, not quite.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Web browsers can be completely controlled by any web page, enabling them to become launching points to attack internal network resources. The web browser of every user on an enterprise network becomes a stepping stone for intruders. Now, imagine visiting a web page that contains JavaScript malware that automatically reconfigures your company&rsquo;s routers or firewalls, from the inside, opening the internal network up to the whole world.  Even worse, common Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities make it possible for these attacks to be launched from just about any website we visit and especially those we trust. The age of web application security malware has begun and it&rsquo;s critical that understand what it is and how to defend against it.</p>

Although the generator is part of an open source project, its source code (about 2500 lines of code) is poorly documented, and patched with hundreds of code patches. We used dynamic and static reverse engineering to learn the operation of this generator.</p>

To an information architect, Ajax means fundamentally changing the design of web applications so they span both client and server. To the security professional, Ajax makes life difficult by increasing the attack surface of web applications and exposing internal logic layers to the entire network. With 70% of attacks coming through the application layer, Ajax makes the job of securing web applications that much harder.</p>

Specifically we will examine the different attack methodologies used against Ajax applications, how Ajax increases the danger of XSS attacks, the dangers of exposing your application logic layer to the network, how bridges can be used to exploit 3rd party sites, and more . Finally we discuss how to properly design an Ajax application to avoid these security issues and demonstrate methods to secure existing applications.</p>

With the near ubiquity of W3C compliant web browsers and advances in dynamic content generation and client-side technologies like AJAX, major players like Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft are creating powerful application accessible only through web browsers. The security risks of web applications are already largely neglected. The discovery of programs that automatically exploit web applications and self-replicate will only make the situation worse.</p>

We will discuss the shortcomings of these two attacks, what that tells us about the author&rsquo;s sophistication, and how their impact could have been worse. Then we will hypothesize two future programs, the Swogmoh worm and the 1929 virus, and discuss their capabilities to learn how these threats might evolve. Finally, we will present guidelines for implementing new web applications securely to resist these new threats.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">Online games are very popular and represent some of the most complex multi-user applications in the world. World of Warcraft<sup>&reg;</sup> takes center stage with over 5 million players worldwide. In these persistent worlds, your property (think gold and magic swords), is virtual&#151;it exists only as a record in a database. Yet, over $600 million real dollars were spent in 2005 buying and selling these virtual items. Entire warehouses in China are full of sweatshop&sbquo; workers who make a few dollars a month to &quot;farm&quot; virtual gold. In other words, these &quot;virtual&quot; worlds are real economies with outputs greater than some small countries. Being run by software, these worlds are huge targets for cheating.  The game play is easily automated through &quot;botting&quot;, and many games have bugs that enable items and gold to be duplicated, among other things. The game publishing companies are responding to the cheating threat with bot-detection technologies and large teams of lawyers. Cheaters are striking back by adding rootkits to their botting programs. The war is on. Hoglund discusses how the gaming environment has pushed the envelope for rootkit development and invasive program manipulation. He discusses World of Warcraft in particular, and an anti-cheating technology known as the &quot;Warden&quot;. </p>
										<p class="textwhite8">In 2005, Hoglund blew the whistle publically on the Warden client and began developing anti-warden technology. He discusses a botting program known as WoWSharp, including some unreleased rootkit development that was used to make it invisible to the Warden. Hoglund discusses some advanced techniques that involve memory cloaking, hyperspacing threads, shadow branching, and kernel-to-user code injection. Both offensive and defensive techniques are discussed.  Software developers working on games would be well advised to attend this talk and people working with malware in general will find the material valuable.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">This talk will go in-depth into methods for breaking crypto faster using FPGAs. FPGA's are chips that have millions of gates that can be programmed and connected arbitrarily to perform any sort of task. Their inherent structure provides a perfect environment for running a variety of crypto algorithms and do so at speeds much faster than a conventional PC. A handful of new FPGA crypto projects will be presented and will demonstrate how many algorithms can be broken much faster than people really think, and in most cases, extremely inexpensively.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Breaking WPA-PSK is possible with coWPAtty, but trying to do so onsite can be time consuming and boring. All that waiting around for things to be computed each and every time we want to check for dumb and default passwords. Well, we're impatient and like to know the password NOW! Josh Wright has recently added support for pre-computed tables to coWPAtty&#151;but how do you create a good set of tables and not have it take 70 billion years? David Hulton has implemented the time consuming PBKDF2 step of WPA-PSK on FPGA hardware and optimized it to run at blazing speeds specifically for cracking WPA-PSK and generating tables with coWPAtty.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">What about those lusers that still use WEP? Have you only collected a few hundred interesting packets and don't want to wait till the universe implodes to crack your neighbor&rsquo;s key? Johnycsh and David Hulton have come up with a method to offload cracking keyspaces to an FPGA and increasing the speed considerably.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">CheapCrack is a work in progress which follows in the footsteps of The Electronic Frontier Foundation's 1998 DES cracking machine, DeepCrack. In the intervening eight years since DeepCrack was designed, built, deployed, and won the RSA DES challenge, FPGAs have gotten smaller, faster, and cheaper. We wondered how feasible it would be to shrink the cost of building a DES cracking machine from $210,000 1998 dollars to around $10,000 2006 dollars, or less, using COTS FPGA hardware, tools, and HDL cores instead of custom fabricated ASICs. We'll show CheapCrack progress to date, and give estimates on how far from completion we are, as well as a live demo.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Lanman hashes have been broken for a long time and everyone knows it's faster to do a Rainbow table lookup than go through the whole keyspace. On many PC's it takes years to go through the entire typeable range, but on a small cluster of FPGAs, you can brute force that range faster than doing a Rainbow table lookup. The code for this will be briefly presented and Chipper v2.0 will be released with many new features.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">David Hulton and Dan Moniz will also discuss some of the aspects of algorithms that make them suitable for acceleration on FPGAs and the reasons why they run faster in hardware.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">In this talk we present a set of projects that can be combined to exploit Bluetooth devices (and users...), weaknesses building a distributed network of agents spreading via Bluetooth which can seek given targets and exploit the devices to log keystrokes, steal data, record audio data, take pictures and then send the collected data back to the attacker, either through the agents network or directly to the attacker.&nbsp;We show the different elements that compose the whole project, giving an estimate, through real data and mathematical models, of the effectiveness of that kind of attack.&nbsp;We also show what our hidden, effective and cool worm-spreading trolley looks like: say hello to the BlueBag! <br />

XSS affects a wide variety of sites and back end web technologies, but there are perhaps no more interesting targets than massively popular sites with viral user acquisition growth curves, which allow for exponential XSS worm propagation, as seen in samy's hack.&nbsp;Combine the power of reaching a wide and ever-widening audience with browser exploits (based on the most common browsers with such a broad &quot;normal person&quot; user base) that can affect more than just the browser as we saw with WMF, a insertion and infection method based on transparent XSS, and payloads which can themselves round-trip the exploit code back into the same or other vulnerable sites, and you have a self-healing distributed worm propagation platform with extremely accelerated infection vectors.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">We investigate the possibilities using MySpace and other popular sites as case studies, along with the potential posed by both WMF and The Metasploit Project's recently-released browser fuzzing tool, Hamachi, to own a site with self-replicating XSS containing a malicious browser-exploiting payload which itself will modify the browser to auto-exploit other sites, all transparent to the user. On top of this one could layer any additional functionality, some loud, some quiet, such as DDoS bots, keyloggers, other viral payloads, and more.</p>

Virtually every Win32 malware added to the WildList as well as ad- and spyware is packed with one or another runtime packer. Not only can they turn older malware into new threats again, but they might also prevent AV vendors from using more generic approaches and therefore requiring more work, which possibly generates more errors or broken updates, unless the product is able to handle all the different runtime packers out there.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Yet, there aren't any comprehensive tests of runtime packer capabilities in AV products so far. We use a testset of more than 3000 runtime-packed files (with different packers, versions, compression options) to determine how well-equipped today's AV software is in dealing with these types of threats. In this presentation, we'll not only discuss the aspects of handling and detecting runtime packed malware, but also have a look into other problems that come along. These include false positives, crashes and the very slow scanning speeds seen in way too many products. Lastly, we will give an overview of the current situation, try to specify reasons for the results we got and show what should and could be done in the future.</p>

											<li class="textwhite8">It's a call to arms. Applications running behind the firewall aren't getting audited. While vulnerability research talent fights over the scraps of Windows OS security, hundreds of thousands of machines remain vulnerable to attacks most people thought were eliminated in the early '90s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
										
										
										</ol>
										<p class="textwhite8">For the past 12 months, Matasano Security has conducted a research project into the security of internal applications. Our theory? That any code which doesn't run in front of a firewall, exposed to Internet hackers, is unaudited, wide open&#151;fertile ground for ever-adapting attackers. Our findings? Tens of applications reversed, proprietary protocols deciphered, &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; XOR encryption algorithms cracked, and it's worse than we thought. Perhaps more than any other software, save the operating system itself, insecure systems management applications pose a grave threat to enterprise security. They're the Agobot that your administrators installed for you.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">But wait, whats this? A tool chain geared around dissecting protocols like a code debugger slices through code? A protocol generation and manipulation framework with a clean, consistent interface, thats scripted instead of compiled? And a fuzzing framework to go along with it? You're saved! Or at least, maybe you'll get to sleep before the sun comes up.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">PDB is a Protocol DeBugger. GDB meets a transparent proxy. Conditionally break based on BPF filters. Modify protocol contents on the fly. Build custom actions that let you manipulate how you speak on the network. Or manually edit protocol fields and send the packets along.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Racket is a protocol generation and manipulation library, in Ruby. Why Ruby? Why not. Use it as a way of writing PDB actions, or on its own. We're flexible that way.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Ramble is a Ruby based fuzzing framework. Set it going, and it just goes on and on and on. We know people like that&#151;but unlike them, Ramble is helpful. Automates the protocol testing you're going to have to do to get full coverage. Do the hard stuff by hand. Use Ramble to do the repetitive stuff.</p>

Happily, once people started seriously thinking about RFID security issues, the ensuing discussion raised a heap of new research questions.&nbsp;This presentation will serve as a forum to address some of these recent comments and questions first-hand; I will start by explaining the fundamental concepts behind RFID malware, and then offer some qualifications and clarifications, separating out &quot;the facts vs. the myth&quot; regarding the real-world implications.</p>

Rootkit technology is growing at an exponential rate and is becoming an everyday problem. Spyware and BotNets for example are using rootkits to hide their presence. During the same time, there have been few public advances in the rootkit detection field since the conception of VICE. The detection that is out there only meets half the need because each tool is designed to detect a very specific threat. After three years, it&rsquo;s time for another run at rootkit detection.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">This presentation will review the state-of-the-industry in rootkit detection, which includes previously known ways to detect rootkits and hooks. It will be shown how the current detection is inadequate for today&rsquo;s threat, as many detection algorithms are being bypassed. The talk will outline what those threats are and how they work. The presentation will then introduce the RAIDE (Rootkit Analysis Identification Elimination) tool and detail RAIDE&rsquo;s unique features such as unhiding hidden processes, showing new ways to detect hidden processes, and restoring non-exported ntoskrnl functions.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">Injecting shellcode into a vulnerable program so you can find it reliably can be tricky. With image format vulnerabilities, sometimes the only place you can put your code is in the image itself. If a file attempting to exploit one of these vulnerabilities was rendered using a non-vulnerable application, the &lsquo;strange&rsquo; files might raise some suspicion; a file containing a NOP-sled and shellcode does not tend to look like any normal photo. What if shellcode could be injected in this way without significantly altering the appearance of the file? What if the entire file could be transformed into executable code but the original image or sound could still be rendered? In this presentation we will present Punk Ode, which combines concepts from steganography, psychophysics and restricted character-set shellcode encoding to hide shellcode in plain sight. We will discuss how to convert a media file into a stream of valid instructions while leaving the initial images/sounds intact so as not to raise suspicion. We will also release a series of tools designed to automate the generation of such files.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">Usually, a personal firewall and an antivirus monitor are the only tools run by a user to protect the system from any malware threat with any level of sophistication. This level significantly increases when malware authors add kernel mode rootkit components to their code in order to avoid easy detection. As rootkit technologies become more and more popular, we can clearly see that many AV vendors begin to integrate anti-rootkit code into their products. However, the firewall evolution is not so obvious. Firewall vendors widely advertise their enhancements to the protection against user mode code injections and similar tricks, which are used by almost any malware out there to bypass more simple firewalls, keeping much less attention to the kernel mode threats. In fact, just a few vendors evolve their kernel mode traffic filter techniques to pose an obstacle for a possible kernel rootkit.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">This presentation will focus on the attacks which may be performed by an NT kernel rootkit to bypass a personal firewall in its core component: the traffic hooking engine. Starting from the brief overview of the entire NT network subsystem, the talk will demonstrate both simple and advanced methods firewalls use to hook in-out traffic. Every firewall trick will be examined in details, and an antidote will be offered to each. It will also be shown that it is possible for a rootkit to operate at a lower level than current firewalls by using only DKOM techniques. The presentation will be accompanied by a live demo of the proof of concept rootkit which is able to bypass even the most advanced personal firewalls available on the market. Finally, a possible solution for hardening firewalls against discussed attacks will be presented.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">The premise of the demonstration is there are no secure systems. Traffic that may have malicious intent, but has not yet caused problems in any published occurrences, may reach protected services and clients after passing through edge equipment and inline IPS devices. This traffic should be sent to closely-monitored virtual machines hosting mirrors of the real services that are segregated from the primary services on the network. These virtual hosts will be the service utilized by certain types of network traffic that may have malicious intent. The purpose of sending potentially malicious traffic to the virtual services is to gain insight into the nature of the potential attack and spare the real services, thus creating an improved risk management model for the deployment of network services that are exposed to the possibility of attack scenarios. However, it is probable that in most cases, the traffic will cause no harm to the virtual system and allow the remote user access to a most likely minimal version of the service.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">The discussion will not be technical to the point where coding techniques are discussed. The premise will entail fitting the demonstrated project into an existing network security topology and a demonstration of an attack that foils current security, reaches the virtual services, and compromises the virtual services while the main services are not taken down. Knowledge of common network security practices and basic security auditing techniques are a prerequisite.</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">The Achilles' heel of network IDSs lies in the large number of false positives (i.e., false attacks) that occur: practitioners as well as researchers observe that it is common for a NIDS to raise thousands of mostly false alerts per day. False positives are a universal problem as they affect both signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. Finally, attackers can overload IT personnel by forging ad-hoc packets to produce false alerts, thereby lowering the defences of the IT infrastructure.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Our thesis is that one of the main reasons why NIDSs show a high false positive rate is that they do not correlate input with output traffic: by observing the output determined by the alert-raising input traffic, one is capable of reducing the number of false positives in an effective manner. To demonstrate this, we have developed APHRODITE (Architecture for false Positives Reduction): an innovative architecture for reducing the false positive rate of any NIDS (be it signature-based or anomaly-based). APHRODITE consists of an Output Anomaly Detector (OAD) and a correlation engine; in addition, APHRODITE assumes the presence of a NIDS on the input of the system. For the OAD we developed POSEIDON (Payl Over Som for Intrusion DetectiON): a two-tier network intrusion detection architecture.</p>
										<p class="textwhite8">Benchmarks performed on POSEIDON and APHRODITE with DARPA 1999 dataset and with traffic dumped from a real-world public network show the effectiveness of the two systems. APHRODITE is able to reduce the rate of false alarms from 50% to 100% (improving accuracy) without reducing the NIDS ability to detect attacks (completeness).</p>

										<p class="textwhite8">Traditionally, host-based anomaly detection has dealt with system call sequences, but not with system call arguments. We propose a prototype which is capable of detecting anomalous system calls in an execution flow, thus helping in tracing intrusions. Our tool analyzes each argument of the system call, characterizing its contents and comparing it with a model of the content. It is able to cluster system calls and detect &quot;different uses&quot; of the same syscall in different points of different programs. It is also able to build a Markovian model of the sequence, which is then used to trace and flag anomalies.</p>
