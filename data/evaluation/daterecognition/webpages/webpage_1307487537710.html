  <p align="left">These are some tips that will help both dentists and patients.</p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    <b>Extractions. What dentists need to know.</b> The proper technique to extract 
    a tooth is place the patient in the reclined position to allow a firm grasp 
    of the head or jaw with the left hand. The attached gingiva is loosened and 
    the tooth rocked with a small elevator if there is room. The tooth is gripped 
    with the forceps and the tips of the forceps forced apically with strong pressure, 
    while squeezing and rotating and rocking gently. You do <b>not</b> PULL a 
    tooth. You break the periodontal fibers and displace the tooth with the forceps. 
    I can't believe dentists are still doing this wrong when the proper technique 
    has been well documented in the oral surgery books for thirty years. PULLING 
    a tooth is very traumatic to the patient. EXTRACTING a tooth is usually relatively 
    simple.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Extractions. What the patient needs to know when he gets 
    home. </b>Your goal when you get home is to have the socket fill with a mature 
    blood clot that will protect the exposed bone. Loss of this clot can result 
    in a dry socket. You should begin taking your pain medication and antibiotics 
    immediately when you get home. Do not smoke, do not suck thru a straw, and 
    do not talk. The gauze resting against the socket should be dry enough to 
    absorb moisture from the blood clot. If it becomes soaked with saliva, change 
    it; because it will no longer absorb moisture. You will need gauze for 6 hours. 
    I do not recommend eating or drinking during this period. I can't emphasize 
    enough that the first 6 hours of maturation of the blood clot is critical. 
    After six to eight hours drink all the luke warm or cold fluids you want. 
    The next day you should begin salt water rinses. It helps kill the bacteria 
    that cause irritation at the extraction site. I would also suggest taking 
    Vitamin C. It helps your immune system fight infection and is important in 
    tissue repair.</p>
  <p align="left"> <b>Removal of Deep Caries.</b> <b>What the dentist needs to 
    know</b>. The dentist should<b> never</b> intentionally expose a pulp to remove 
    caries. 75% of the time a pulpal exposure results an abscess which requires 
    extraction or a root canal. Again, the proper technique has been documented 
    in dental restoration books for thirty years. As much caries are removed as 
    possible without exposing the pulp. Then a sedative dressing or preparation 
    such as Dycal is used (depending on your philosophy). The tooth is then sealed 
    for six months. The temporary alloy restoration removed and the presence of 
    caries re-evaluated. 95% of the time the caries is arrested. (So is it really 
    that critical if the patient returns for the second procedure or not?) </p>
  <p align="left"><b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>rule for all dental preparations.</b> Maintain 
    an ideal depth of 1/2 millimeter into dentin in all preparation areas. Only 
    after the ideal preparation has been performed, with caries circumscribed, 
    should the caries be removed. Failure to observed this rule results in preparations 
    that are too close to the pulp and invites tooth abscess.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Polishing MOD onlays and Class II alloys.</b> Use fine garnet, 
    medium sand, and fine cuttle snap on disks; in that order on proximal margins. 
    For MOD onlay occlusal margins use slow speed green stone, white stone, brownie, 
    and greenie. For Class II and Class I alloy occlusals use high speed white 
    stone, brownie, and greenie.</p>
  <p align="left"> <b>Alloys vs. Composites. What dentists and patients need to 
    think about</b>. Now about the phobia over mercury in amalgam fillings. Mercury 
    poisoning has only questionably attributed to amalgam fillings in a few cases. 
    On the other hand white composite fillings are <b>very </b>technique sensitive 
    and usually leak. If they leak they must be replaced, requiring the removal 
    of more tooth structure. If you want a cheap, simply placed, long lasting 
    restoration, I will pick an alloy every time. If you want the best, go for 
    gold foil or inlays and onlays.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Abscessed Tooth. What dentists need to know.</b> If a patient 
    has an abscessed tooth, for God's sake pull it! (Or extirpate the pulp and 
    take out of occlusion to prepare for a root canal!) The abscess will drain 
    through the socket and heal quickly with postoperative antibiotics. This has 
    been standard treatment for at least 30 years. There is no need to premedicate 
    with antibiotics a week before extracting the tooth. <b>You have not removed 
    the source of the infection and you prolonging the patients suffering. </b></p>
  <p align="left"> <b>Endodontic Accesses. What dentists need to know.</b> A tip 
    for dentists doing root canals. Forget the pictures in you Endodontic books 
    you memorized for preparing accesses to the pulp chamber. Use a #6 high long 
    shank carbide bur and drill straight down thru the <b>center</b> of tooth. 
    (Whether it is a molar, bicuspid, or incisor just aim for the<b> center</b> 
    of the tooth.) Use gentle pressure once you are thru the enamel. You will 
    feel the loss of resistance as you enter the roof of the pulp chamber. Be 
    careful not to touch the base of the pulp chamber with the bur. Once the pulp 
    chamber is open, repeatedly lift the bur in and out of the pulp chamber at 
    full speed to eliminate the ledges and create a natural access opening. <b>Build 
    your confidence by trying this on extracted teeth first. (Of course you should 
    be doing this with any new procedure.)</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Endodontic Fills. What dentists need to think about.</b> 
    It is my opinion that the best endodontic fill is to produce a dentin plug 
    with dentin filings at the constriction of the canal before it flares in the 
    last apical 3/4 millimeter of the tooth. The worst thing you can do is blow 
    the apex by filing to far with a large file. The purpose of an endodontic 
    filling is to seal the pulp chamber from the surrounding tissue. There is 
    no better apical plug than dentin.(Which may calcify.) Fill the remainder 
    of the pulp chamber with a cement that will extrude into the pinpoint channels 
    of the pulp chamber and complete the fill a traditional laterally condensed 
    gutta percha. I don't believe in excessive force in lateral packing of gutta 
    percha points using the spreader. (After all you are dealing with a non-vital 
    brittle tooth.) </p>
  <p align="left">The traditional radiograph with an apical button of sealant 
    is not the best fill.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>One sitting root canal.</b> <b>What dentists need to know.</b> 
    There is no reason why any root canal cannot be prepared and filled in one 
    sitting. </p>
  <p align="left"><b>Use of Antibiotics in Endodontics. What dentists need to 
    know. </b>There is no problem prescribing antibiotics after filling a root 
    canal. You are dealing with an abscessed tooth and have certainly forced some 
    bacteria apically into the tissue.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Dentures. What patients need to know</b>. A lower denture 
    is worthless for chewing. I never met a happy denture wearer. Avoid them.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Dentures. What dentist need to know. </b>Every new denture 
    will have local areas of excessive pressure that the patient will perceive 
    as sore spots. It is easy to see and eliminate these spots if you <b>use Pressure 
    Indicating Paste correctly</b>. Make a cheap effective paste yourself by combining 
    equal amounts of zinc oxide powder and Crisco with an electic mixer. Store 
    in the refrigerator. A cheap paste allows you to remove what you need for 
    each patient and discard it. This prevents cross-contamination by dipping 
    brushes into the same paste for different patients. You can use art paste 
    brushes that cost about 25 cents apiece. Discard after each patient. You will 
    probably have to cut off about half the bristle length to get a sufficiently 
    stiff brush. <b>A soft, squishy brush like comes in the kits is worthless. 
    </b>The idea is to spread a thin layer of paste over the surface of the denture. 
    You should see uniform even brush marks over the whole surface. Insert the 
    denture, <b>press down firmly</b> and remove it. You will clearly see the 
    pressure areas where the brush marks are disrupted. Shave the pressure areas 
    with a mellite bur, and repeat the process until you see a uniform layer of 
    paste when you remove the denture.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Quality Economy Dentures. </b><a href="economy-dentures.pdf">Here 
    is a link for dentists interested in making quality dentures quickly.</a></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Flossing. Using floss to prevent gum disease and cavities. 
    </b>If you are an adult you must floss daily to prevent periodontitis. You 
    must floss your children regularly to prevent interdental caries which are 
    the most destructive type of cavities. </p>
  <p align="left">Despite the importance of flossing probably fewer than one in 
    a thousand people do it daily. If you are like me regular floss sheds and 
    breaks off in between my teeth. I suggest Johnson &amp; Johnson REACH Dentotape 
    Waxed Floss. Very few people will develop the dexterity to floss themselves 
    effectively. Therefore <b>I suggest Glide Floss Picks</b>. They are so easy 
    to use that even my eleven year old daughter can floss effectively.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Crown preparations. What dentists need to know.</b> When 
    cutting crown preps keep the shank of the bur in the long axis of the tooth. 
    Let taper on the bur provide the draw for the tooth prep. Do not angle your 
    bur to create draw. I know they always say to use a mirror, but I have found 
    that a crown prep can be cut very quickly (3 minutes) with the patient in 
    the fully reclined postion, using direct vision. Initial reduction of the 
    tooth is done with a tapered 557 bur. For a full crown, open the mesial and 
    distal contacts, then do the occlusal reduction. Then come back with the diamond 
    to refine the finish lines. </p>
  <p align="left"><b>Retraction cord. What dentists need to know.</b> You can 
    make retraction cord yourself, and it is better than cord you buy commercially. 
    The cord is made from knitting yarn and Aluminum Chloride solution. Get Aluminum 
    Chloride crystals from you pharmacist. Cut the cord into pieces and soak in 
    a Aluminum Chloride solution. (Note Aluminum Chloride is the main ingredient 
    in antipersperants.)</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The two primary impression techniques I use for crowns are 
    rubber base and silicone putty-wash.</b><br>
    <b>I prefer the silicone putty-wash method</b>. You place the retraction cord 
    around the tooth and have the patient bite down on gauze to keep the area 
    dry. The silicone wash should be stored in a large syringe (10cc) to allow 
    accurate dispensing and use of the right amount of catalyst. The assistant 
    mixes the putty at the same time you mix the wash and load it into a syringe. 
    Stand behind the patient with their head forward so that impression material 
    flows out of the mouth and not back down the throat. Take out the gauze and 
    inject the wash around the tooth. Take the tray with putty and insert it. 
    Always hold the tray in place yourself till the set occurs and it is ready 
    for removal. Hold the tray firmly so it does not move, with the patients chin 
    down so material flows towards the front of the mouth. You must be in control. 
    Talk firmly, but reassuringly to the patient, praising their efforts. All 
    of this is crucial in an upper impression where the gag reflex is easily triggered. 
    Examine the impression after removal. If all the margins are not captured, 
    cut out the interpoximal tags in the impression. Replace the cord around the 
    tooth, and have them bite on down on gauze as before. Have your assistant 
    mix up the wash. Inject some wash into the old impression, such that there 
    is wash in each tooth impression. Remove the gauze and cord and inject wash 
    around the tooth. Firmly press the impression with wash into place. Hold the 
    impression as before until it sets. I have never had an impression not come 
    out the second time using this method. Some dentists say that reusing an impression 
    in this manner can result in a die that is too small and a crown that won't 
    fit. All I can say is it always worked fine for me. <br>
    <b>The second technique is rubber base. </b>You will be mixing heavy body 
    to put in the tray, and light body to put in the syringe. The problem with 
    rubber base is it can be slow setting. It is also messier. Have the assistant 
    mix the light body and load it into a syringe. You mix the heavy body. After 
    you mix the catalyst into the heavy body, place three to four drops of water 
    on top of the mix. Spatulate it in rapidly and thouroughly, taking no more 
    than 10 seconds. The water accelerates the setting time, and if you are not 
    fast it will setup before you get into the mouth. Proceed as before, remove 
    the gauze and cord. Inject the wash and place the tray with the heavy body 
    in the mouth. Remember to hold the tray firmly and patients head down while 
    the rubber cures. Remove the tray. Check that you can see all margins. If 
    not, cut out interproximal tags with a scissors. Place the cord and gauze 
    back in the mouth, and mix light body. Put light body evenly around the impressions 
    in the bottom of the tray. Remove the cord and gauze, inject light body around 
    the tooth, and firmly seat the impression in the mouth. Hold the impression 
    firmly in place with the patient's head down until the wash sets. Again, I 
    have never seen an impression not come out the second time. And again, this 
    technique has always provided good fitting crowns as the final product.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Alternatives to gold when casting crowns.</b> Gold is of 
    course best for inlays, onlays and 3/4 crowns, but there are alternatives. 
    For inlays, onlays, and 3/4 crowns a silver palladium alloy can be used. For 
    pocelain crowns a non-precious alloy can be used, and is actually stronger 
    than gold. When using silver palladium or non-precious alloys, you need the 
    maximum expansion of the molds. Use two layers of asbestos liner in the casting 
    ring and remove the mold completely from the ring before casting. Don't worry, 
    the investment used for these metals is rock hard and won't break. When adjusting 
    contacts of non-precious metals, you best use a high speed 558 bur and a high 
    speed white stone to smooth the surface, or you will be there all day adjusting 
    contacts. Be careful when using non-precious alloys such as Rexillium because 
    they contain Beryllium. Beryllium is poisenous and should not be inhaled.<a href="http://www.osha.gov/dts/hib/hib_data/hib020419.html"> 
    Here is a link to the OSHA page on beryllium.</a></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Pulpal exposures on baby teeth require formocresol pulpotomy 
    with stainless steel crown.</b> Pulpal exposures are common in baby teeth. 
    The only treatment is to open the pulp chamber, and extirpate the pulp with 
    a slow speed #8 round. Clean the pulp chamber thoroughly and dry. Put a drop 
    of formocresol on a cotton pedget and squeeze the cotton pledget firmly dry. 
    Place the squeezed cotton pledget into the pulp chamber and have the child 
    bite down on cotton gauze for several minutes. Then mix IRM or ZOE paste with 
    a drop of formocresol and fill the pulp chamber. Prepare the tooth for a stainless 
    steel crown. With a long shank tapered 556 bur slice through the mesial and 
    distal contacts. Avoid leaving any ledges, this is not a crown prep. Reduce 
    the occlusal. Select the appropriate size stainless steel crown and slide 
    it over the tooth. Scratch the gingival margin of the stainless steel crown 
    with an explorer. Remove the crown with a discoid-cleoid and adjust the margins. 
    Again, I do not use scissors. I use a 558 high speed bur to shape the stainless 
    steel crowns, and smooth with a high speed white stone. Repeatedly adjust 
    margins and try on tooth until it fits properly. The margins of the crown 
    should be under the gingiva. But if the gingiva is white, it means the crown 
    is pressing into it, and the crown is too long. Cement crown to place with 
    crown and bridge cement. It seems like a lot of work, but it should not take 
    over fifteen or twenty minutes with some experience.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Important note on cavity preparations.</b> You must prepare 
    the tooth using ideal extensions which are not more than 1/2 millitmeter into 
    the dentin at any point. First you create the ideal preparation with extensions 
    around the caries; not more that 1/2 millimeter into the dentin. Only after 
    you have completed this ideal preparation do you go deeper into the tooth 
    to carefully remove the caries. Do not mechanically expose the pulp. If you 
    are close to a pulpal exposure, leave the remaining caries. Place dycal, copalite, 
    and a temporary restoration that will not leak. In six months remove the filling 
    and examine the tooth to see if caries was arrested and place your permanent 
    restoration. </p>
  <p align="left"><b>Always use dycal when near the pulp</b>, and always use cavity 
    varnish before cementing crowns or placing alloys. Use dycal on all dentin 
    surfaces beneath a composite filling. (Do not use cavity varnish beneath composite 
    fillings.)</p>
  <p align="left"><b>You can use alginate Impressions for dentures and partial 
    removable prosthetics. </b>Fit a regular custom tray with blue border wax 
    and fit to place in the mouth. Use the quick set, heavy body alginate for 
    the impression. Pour the impression immediately. Use a double pour technique 
    to avoid distortion of the impression. First pour enough stone to cover the 
    critical portions of the impression. (Mix the stone using slurry water from 
    your model trimmer to accelerate the set.) After the initial set, pour the 
    base.</p>
  <p align="left">Note: You can easily control how much water is in the stone 
    mix after you add the water. Chances are that after mixing it will be too 
    runny. By pouring the stone mix into a two paper towels, you can dry the mix 
    to a heavier body consistency by drawing off the extra water. This is important 
    when pouring any models.</p>
  <p align="left"> <b>The following is the method I used for pouring all impressions:</b><br>
    1. Mix the stone with slurry water over a vibrator with soft rubber mixing 
    bowl and spatula to eliminate as many bubbles as possible.<br>
    2. Scoop some mix onto your spatula. Let a small amount of mix run from the 
    back molars on one side of the impression, around the front to the back end 
    of the opposite side of the impression. Don't worry if the mix seems a little 
    runny in the impression. It is important to watch it flow in and out of each 
    tooth depression, all the way around the impression to prevent bubbles. It 
    helps the mix flow if you hold the impression in your hand, and rest your 
    hand on the vibrator.<br>
    3. Pour the remainder of the stone mix from the mixing bowl into some paper 
    towels. Squeeze the mix in the paper towels to absorb the excess water. The 
    result is a mix that is easily held in your hand. Gently lay it into the impression. 
    Again hold the impression in your hand, with your hand against the vibrator. 
    The heavy body mix will displace the runny mix of stone in the bottom of the 
    impression.<br>
    4. The result is a fast setting, dense impression. The faster the set, the 
    less distortion to the impression while the mix hardens.</p>

  <h2 align="left"><a name="Veins"></a>Getting veins to &quot;pop up&quot; when 
    taking blood or placing IV's</h2>
  <p align="left">This is not a trivial topic. Sick people should not be stabbed 
    time after time while the health care professional tries to get a vein. There 
    are two techniques that work every time. Both are based on the principle that 
    if you block the flow of blood out of the arm through the veins, while allowing 
    blood into the arm through the arteries, the back pressure will cause the 
    veins to fill with blood and &quot;pop up&quot; at the surface.</p>
  <p align="left">The technique taught by an oral surgeon was a two person technique. 
    The doctor holds his fingers over the pulse on the wrist. The assistant then 
    wraps a towel around the upper arm (like a tourniquet) and tightens it until 
    the doctor says the pulse has stopped. The doctor then tells the assistant 
    to loosen the towel gradually, until the pulse just begins to return. The 
    doctor then tells the assistant to maintain this tension for 15 to 30 seconds 
    until he can feel the veins below the surface of the skin. The doctor then 
    draws the blood or places the IV. The towel is then removed.</p>
  <p align="left">A second technique uses a blood pressure cuff and can be performed 
    by one person. A blood pressure cuff measures the systolic pressure as blood 
    pumps through the arteries. The cuff measures diastolic pressure as the blood 
    returns through the veins. By maintaining the pressure of the cuff just below 
    the systolic pressure, the arteries deliver blood to the arm, but there is 
    enough pressure on the veins to prevent it from leaving the arm. Place the 
    cuff on the upper arm, with one hand on the wrist pulse. Pump the cuff till 
    the wrist pulse stops and slowly release the pressure in the cuff until the 
    pulse returns (systolic pressure). Maintain this pressure until you feel the 
    veins plump and insert the IV. The cuff is then removed.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="left"><a name="Religion"></a>Religion and Philosophy</h2>
  <p align="left">1. I believe in good and evil as professed by the Christian 
    faith. I believe all people are influenced by good and evil. I believe good 
    and evil are present in our every day lives. I believe that you that you are 
    accountable for your actions in life. I believe you are judged after death, 
    and that God evens things out. I do not believe that as living beings we will 
    know the meaning of life; or understand why God created life, death, good, 
    evil, happiness, and pain.</p>
  <p align="left">2. Some people believe you live many lives (similar to Hindu 
    beliefs). They believe a good life now is reward for a bad past life. They 
    believe a bad life now is the pay back for a past good life. This belief tends 
    to subscribe to the view that things just happen, and you have no responsibility. 
    I don't buy it.</p>
  <p align="left">3. The Jews in Jesus time (and many Christians today) believed 
    that people in pain were being punished for their sins. This type of view 
    encourages apathy for the pain and suffering of others. </p>
  <p align="left">4. Jesus said life was full of pain and that those who followed 
    him would suffer the most. But in the midst of pain there is spiritual joy 
    in doing the right thing.</p>
  <h2 align="left"><a name="What"></a>What is wrong with the public school system?</h2>
  <p align="left">1. Many children in many states do not have books to do homework 
    out of. Books provide the basis for a structure of learning independently. 
    They need books. </p>
  <p align="left">2. Learning centers such as Sylvan have incredible track records 
    for bring students skills up several grade levels with just a few hours a 
    week spread over 6 to 9 months. What the hell is wrong with the public school 
    system? They should get some tips from the Sylvan people.</p>
  <p align="left">3. Many people think using big words shows how smart they are. 
    It is not true. The sign of genius is explaining a complex operation or idea 
    in simple terms. Einstein's E = Mc2 is a classic example. Terminology helps 
    professionals discuss things they are familiar with. But any information that 
    is new to a person must be explained in simple terms first, without the confusion 
    of big words. Teaching a child concepts and how to work the problem is more 
    important than complex terminology. Anyone can understand Calculus using the 
    books I used in college. But the book my Dad used is impossible to understand.</p>
  <p align="left">4. Schools need to spend more time on basics. Starting out the 
    school year teaching <b>median, mean, and mode</b> is a waste of time when 
    a though knowledge of basic algebra operations is much more important to a 
    seventh grader.</p>
  <h2 align="left"><a name="Help"></a>Help educate the world. Put your ideas in 
    your own book on your own web page. There are lots of sites that host web 
    pages for free.</h2>

  <p align="left">The advantage to PDF files is they cannot be tampered with, 
    and any document that can be scanned can be placed on the internet without 
    special skills.</p>
  <p align="left"> You will find that when printing some PDF documents the letters 
    are run together without spaces. Try two things. First, reduce the magnification 
    of the file to 50%. Second, check the<b> print file as image</b> option in 
    the printer dialog box.. Experiment around by printing out one or two pages 
    to see if you get the results you want.</p>
  <p align="left">If you find that part of the page is cut off after printing, 
    try checking just the <b>fit to page</b> option in the printer dialog box.</p>
  <h2 align="left"><a name="Vitamins"></a>Vitamins and how they can directly help 
    you</h2>
  <p align="left">1. At the age of forty plus I am a believer in vitamins. I saw 
    an info-commercial on the benefits of Calcium. I was having extreme cramps 
    in my legs and figured I had nothing to lose. I now take Calcium, Magnesium, 
    and Vitamin E supplements for the cramps and have seen incredible improvement. 
    (Look on the internet for suggested dosages. Do the research.)</p>
  <p align="left">2. My fiancee started me taking Vitamin C supplements to ward 
    off colds. When I feel a cold coming I now take five 1000mg tablets spread 
    out daily for several days. I have not had cold symptoms for two years. She 
    started this routine after getting pneumonia three years ago and hasn't had 
    a cold since. We both take one 1000mg tablet at morning and night as a daily 
    supplement.(Do some research. Some people develop diarrhea from taking large 
    doses of Vitamin C.)</p>
  <p align="left">3. There is a bulk of evidence that Saw Palmetto can improve 
    prostate health. I take this also. At my age I need the insurance.</p>
  <p align="left">4. There is also strong evidence that people who take Selenium 
    supplements have a much lower incidence of cancer. At my age I need all the 
    insurance I can get.</p>
  <p align="left">5. In short I take the following: Selenomax Selenium 200mcg 
    once daily, Vitamin C 1000mg twice daily, Glucosamine 500mg + Chondroitin 
    400mg twice daily, Saw Palmetto 160mg twice daily, Magnesium133mg twice daily, 
    Vitamin E 400 I.U. twice daily, Calcium plus D 600mg 3-4 tablets three times 
    daily for a daily total of Calcium of 8000mg daily. Take plenty of water with 
    the vitamins. </p>
  <p align="left">6. Who knows what the long term effects are of taking all these 
    vitamins and minerals and herbs, but I feel much much better. My general energy 
    level is 20% higher. My cravings for caffeine and sweets has diminished. My 
    aerobic stamina has improved by 20%. The cramping in my legs diminished immediately 
    with the Calcium supplements. And I see I direct effect of large doses of 
    Vitamin C on cold and flu symptoms.</p>
  <p align="left">7. I use to guzzle the Cokes. I have read that excessive soft 
    drink consumption can cause a multitude of problems. I now drink Vitamin waters 
    instead. They are a little expensive, but just plain water is fine. (I prefer 
    bottled water over city tap water. It is easier on my stomach. It is only 
    $1.75 for 5 gallons if you get it yourself.) </p>
  <p align="left">8. Vitamins are relatively inexpensive at Walmart and Henry's.</p>

  <p align="left"><b>The war in Vietnam soured my generation on foreign wars.</b> 
    The war in Korea soured my father's generation on foreign wars. I admit to 
    having a glimmer of hope after Afghanistan. Enlisting the aid of determined 
    local opposition worked incredibly well. Sincere congratulations to the establishment.</p>

  <p align="left"><b>Benedryl - how it can help you rest.</b> You or someone you 
    know will deal with a stress related illness. They include ulcers, TMJ (jaw 
    pain), back pain, and headaches.<br>
    If you feel particularly stressed, taking a single dose of Benadryl will help 
    rest when you lay down. The antihistamine has a sedative side effect.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Night guards can prevent jaw pain.</b> Many people suffer 
    from TMJ (jaw pain) related symptoms. These can be experienced as jaw pain, 
    clicking of the jaws, pain in your teeth, and temporal headaches. Jaw pain 
    often feels like an earache. (You can feel the jaw joint if you put your fingers 
    just in front of your ears and open and close.) It is often associated with 
    grinding or clenching your teeth. It is no joke. The pain can be excruciating. 
    A simple preventive remedy is use of a night guard. In its simplest form a 
    night guard is the same mouthpiece athletes wear to protect their teeth. One 
    I would recommend in Custom Fit Mouth Guard by Shield Mfg. Inc, 425 Fillmore 
    Ave., Tongwanda, N.Y. 14150. It is available at Rite Aid drugstores. The kit 
    only costs about $4 and is as effective as night guards that cost $60 to $100. 
    Follow the instructions on the back carefully. Buy two kits. It may take a 
    couple tries to get it right. Use a sharp scissors to trim off the handle 
    on the front and the excess filler around the edges. Wear it while you sleep.</p>

  <h2 align="left"><a name="Soldering"></a>Soldering copper pipes in your home</h2>
  <p align="left">If you have copper piping in your home, sooner or later you 
    will have to do some soldering. I read every reference I found on soldering. 
    In practice the following technique will give you the best results. The problem 
    with soldering copper is that the solder won't flow if the pipe is too cold 
    or too hot.<b> I strongly recommend you do a couple practice joints before 
    doing the real thing.</b><br>
    1. Buy a soldering kit a someplace like Home Depot. (torch, tip, sandpaper, 
    solder, flux, with some couplings and a short length of pipe to practice on)<br>
    2. Thoroughly sand the pieces to be soldered. Unwrap 8 inches from the roll 
    of solder.<br>
    3. If the pipes have a slow drip you can place a wad of white bread into the 
    pipe to plug it. This will keep water out of the solder joint. It will dissolve 
    when you turn the water back on.<br>
    3. Apply a liberal coat of flux to both surfaces and assemble the joint.<br>
    4. Begin strongly heating the whole area around the solder joint (at least 
    two inches to either side). Always move the flame around. Do not hold it in 
    one spot.<br>
    5. When the flux begins to boil, you can back off on the heat a little bit.<br>
    6. <b>Now is the important part.</b> <b>Touch</b> the end of the solder to 
    the joint to be soldered, while maintaining heat to the joint by applying 
    flame to the opposite side of pipe. <b>Continue holding the solder against 
    the joint and heating until the solder begins to flow.</b> This will take 
    a minute or two more of heating. You now know the pipe is at the right temperature, 
    move the flame around and apply the solder to different areas of the joint 
    until it is full.<br>

  <h2 align="left"><a name="Fertilizers"></a>Fertilizers</h2>
  <p align="left">You can't beat Miracle Grow for getting young plants started. 
    But for mature lawns, shrubs, and trees I suggest the all purpose 16-16-16 
    time release granules. It seems to work better on mature plants, is cheaper, 
    easier to apply, and activates each time you water. It takes about a week 
    and a half to two weeks for the lawn to green after fertilizing and is good 
    for about a month after the grass greens. Apply the fertilizer in the afternoon 
    when the lawn is dry to avoid burning your grass. Water thoroughly immediately 
    after applying, 1 1/2 to 2 inches.</p>

    under the weed and lift out. It's incredible. A picture is worth a thousand

  <h2 align="left"><a name="Credit-cards"></a>Credit Cards Make Sense</h2>
  <p align="left">My checking account was compromised through theft using an ATM 
    machine. But I use a credit card all the time for purchases on the internet, 
    and in just about any store. Credit cards are accepted country wide, world 
    wide. Try doing that with a check. I pay no monthly fees, because I pay it 
    off monthly; and I my credit card does not charge annual fees. It has never 
    been compromised. It takes at least 3 to 5 minutes to pay for an item with 
    a check, if they take a check. It takes 30 seconds to complete a credit card 
    transaction. A credit card is great for emergencies. Try renting a car without 
    one. (Good Luck!!) A credit card used wisely makes good sense.</p>
  <h2 align="left"><a name="Training"></a>Training Dogs</h2>
  <p align="left">Yes, at the ripe age of 47 years I am training a puppy for the 
    first time in my life. It is not easy and takes a great deal of discipline. 
    I hope some of the advice that follows helps you.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Advice from the breeder. </b>&quot;Under no circumstance 
    is it acceptable to hit this kind of dog, they respond so much better to affection 
    training. If he is misbehaving take the posture of alpha male, get real aggressive 
    and growl your words at him, coming at him like you are going to kill him 
    and eat him. When he rolls over and submits put your hand around his throat, 
    gently, and then change your voice and pet him gently in recognition of his 
    submission. Then he should get lots of loving for submitting. After a bit 
    of this it will take only a sharp voice to get his attention, then follow 
    it with the affection. In this way he learns what kind of behavior is acceptable.&quot; 
    <b>(Switching back and forth between angry and loving is stressful and hard 
    work, but it is effective.)</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Advice from the Evans Guide for House training Your Dog.</b> 
    If your dog thinks that it is Alpha, you are in trouble. One way to develop 
    your Alpha-hood is to simply get your dog's eye. Take your dog on a leash, 
    and sit it. Hold a little upward tension on the lead and bend down and touch 
    hour dog's muzzle, and immediately bring your hand up to your eyes. At the 
    same time, make a clicking sound and issue a sentence like, &quot;Tippy, look 
    up here at me right now.&quot; Don't just say the dog's name or &quot;Tippy, 
    look.&quot; It won't be enough to get the dog to lock eyes with you. That's 
    what your're aiming for - three to four seconds of solid eye contact when 
    the dog looks up at you with an attitude of &quot;your wish is my command.&quot; 
    Make sure after you touch your dog's muzzle and then your eyes that you straighten 
    up right away so that the dog truly looks up at you and not you down at the 
    dog. Once you have the lock, end the moment with some light verbal (not physical) 
    praise such as, &quot;Good boy, Tippy!&quot; Then turn and go about your day.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The dog looks at its master as its mother, and the following 
    description by my fiancee of how the puppy's mother and father corrected it 
    is quite illuminating.</b> &quot;When the puppy got out of hand (a little 
    too rambunctious with it's parents) the mother would hold it down by the neck 
    while the father knocked it down. As the puppy lay on its back the mother 
    continued to hold it by the throat until it lay still. Only after it was still 
    would the mother let it up.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><b>As for me. </b>Unfortunately we live next to convalescent 
    center for the elderly; and having a whining, howling puppy was not an option. 
    I asserted my dominance with a squirt bottle. Once he knew I meant business 
    with the squirt bottle, he settled down. I only had to use the squirt bottle 
    on a total of eight occasions over two weeks. At the same time during these 
    two weeks, I held him every day, four times a day, for an hour and a half 
    to reinforce the bonding between us. I also let him lick my face, to let him 
    show affection, as he would for his father and mother. At the end of two weeks 
    the breeder's advice held true. The combination of a sharp word, followed 
    by affection when he did the right thing, was all that was necessary.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>So you are getting an adult dog. </b>Many adult dogs can 
    be retrained. Pets were trained for combat service in World War II, de-programmed 
    and returned to their owners at the end of the war.</p>
  <h2 align="left"><a name="What-puppy"></a>What you need to know when you get 
    a new puppy</h2>
  <p align="left">According to the article below the best time to get a puppy 
    is between 6 and 8 weeks of age.The puppy must have been weaned (Living separate 
    from its mother and eating dry puppy food) from its mother for at least a 
    week, and two weeks is recommended. You must ask what brand of food the puppy 
    is being fed, and use the exact same food. The treats that are given to him 
    should be the same brand also. At six to eight weeks of age the puppy is due 
    for its first shots ($20). It will cost about $65 to have the puppy microchiped 
    and registered, but it is worth it. I would also consider puppy health insurance. 
    Common medical problems that will require treatment include: objects caught 
    in the throat, urinary infections, ear infections.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The following is an excerpt</b> from <a href="http://nrta.com">The 
    National Rat Terrier Web site</a>. &quot;In the period of socialization there 
    are two basic rules for producing a well-balanced and well-adjusted dog. The 
    first of these is that the ideal time to produce a close social relationship 
    between a puppy and his master occurs between 6 and 8 weeks of age. This is 
    the optimal time to remove a puppy from the litter and make it into a house 
    pet. If this is done earlier, especially at 4 weeks or before, the puppy has 
    little opportunity to form normal social relationships with other dogs. It 
    will form close relationships with people but may have difficulty adjusting 
    to its own kind even in mating or caring for puppies. On the other hand, if 
    primary socialization with people is put off to a much later period (the outside 
    limit being about 12 weeks), the social relationships of the puppy with other 
    dogs may be very good, but he will tend to be timid and to lack confidence 
    with people. Although all dog breeds have the capacity to develop a close 
    social relationship with people, the importance of this relationship varies 
    with the dog�s future use. A strong relationship is highly important with 
    pet dogs, working dogs, and those hunting dogs which work under close direction. 
    It is probably not so important in most hounds, with which the dog-human relationship 
    is not so essential for successful hunting.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Favorite chew toys.</b> The puppies favorite chew is a small 
    rawhide stick (without the knots), that he can chew on with his back teeth. 
    His favorite tug of war item is a cloth covered, foam frisbee.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Shampoo</b>. The best shampoo is the oatmeal shampoo for 
    dogs you get at the pet store. Even Johnson's Baby Shampoo gave him a severe 
    case of dandruff. </p>
  <p align="left"><b>Living quarters.</b> The puppy lives in a large carry-all 
    designed for transporting animals. It is under an awning outside, but we also 
    placed a large piece of plywood on top of it to keep out the rain. Puppies 
    living outside will require a heat source at night. I use a heating pad, with 
    the wires protected in PVC pipe. <b>You must protect the pad and wires from 
    him chewing on them.</b></p>

    dragons, goblins, wizards, and elves. It is a tale of good vs. evil.</p>
  <p align="left"><b> The Lord of the Rings </b>by<b> J.R.R Tolkien </b>consists

  <p align="left"><b>Wyatt Earp The Life Behind The Legend </b>by<b> Casey Tefertiller. 
    </b>Yes, Dofusdaddy enjoys stories about the old West. Though I idolized him 
    as a child I have seen conflicting stories about Wyatt Earp on TV and in books. 
    This book goes into detail about his life, especially concerning Tombstone 
    and is meticulously researched.<b><br>

  <p align="left"><b>TAI-PAN </b>by <b>James Clavell. </b>A fairly long book, 
    it is enjoyable bedtime reading for adults. It will hold your attention. It 
    is a novel set in Hong Kong a the time when the British established it as

    Western culture.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The Celebrated Cases of Sherlock Holmes</b> (Treasury of 
    World Masterpieces) by<b> Sir Arthur</b> <b>Conan Doyle</b>. I picked up this 
    book for a dollar at a Salvation Army store and have thoroughly enjoyed rereading 
    the mysteries.</p>
  <h2 align="left"><a name="Saving-files"></a>Saving files to floppy or CD on 
    your computer</h2>
  <p align="left">For years the standard way of saving files on your computer 
    was to use floppy disks. Unfortunately a floppy doesn't hold much, and floppies 
    aren't as reliable as a CD. CD's only cost 14 cents a piece and one CD takes 
    the place of 450 floppies. You can buy a CD-RW (CD burner) for $40 and Easy 
    CD Creator 5 software for about $65. You need a Pentium II or better to use 
    a burner.<b> You can use the CD as a scratch pad for miscellaneous files. 
    When burning the file DO NOT FINALIZE THE CD. This allows you to reuse the 
    CD and add more files to the CD. You can use the same CD over and over.</b></p>
  <h2 align="left"><a name="A-backup-stategy"></a>A backup strategy for your home 
    computer system</h2>
  <p align="left">You need a CD burner and software. Because photos and music 
    take up so much disk space, create seperate folders for them outside My Documents. 
    <b>All </b>other files should be saved in folders in <b>My Documents</b>. 
    Whenever you add new material you want saved, burn a copy of the folders <b>Pictures</b>, 
    <b>Music</b>, or <b>My Documents</b>. Dofusdaddy backs up his file daily and 
    stores them conveniently on and empty spindle that the blank CD's come on.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Restoring your system. </b>I have had to restore my system 
    three times in two years, even though I use anti-virus software that I update 
    frequently. (Dofusdaddy didn't check downloaded files for viruses.) But all 
    my files were safely restored from my CD backup. Just copy and paste the files 
    from the CD to the My Documents folder on your computer. <b>The following 
    is IMPORTANT. </b>All the files you copy back to your computer will be <b>Read-only</b> 
    protected in the permissions for each file. You must change this to be able 
    to write to the files. <b>For Windows 98</b> an individual file can be changed 
    clicking once to high-lite, right clicking to bring up the menu, clicking 
    on properties, unchecking the Read-only box, clicking on Apply, clicking on 
    OK. This process can be speeded up by highlighting a group of files, right 
    clicking, and repeating the process described above. Changing the properties 
    of a folder will not change the properties of all the files in it.</p>
  <p align="left">An added trick I learned from my fiancee's son, who was a computer 
    tech, is to copy the <b>Favorites</b> folder from C:\Windows\Favorites and 
    paste it to My Documents. You can then restore your <b>Favorites</b> off the 
    internet when rebuilding your computer by repasting it to the C:\Windows folder.</p>

    need a micro-distribution of linux on a bootable floppy or CD. Fdisk in Windows

  <h2 align="left"><a name="Deductions"></a>Understanding income tax and deductions</h2>
  <p align="left">Federal Income Taxes are the most basic tax we deal with our 
    whole lives. It is important to understand the basics of <b>Total Income</b>, 
    <b>Taxable Income</b>, and <b>Deductions</b>. Everyone knows that the IRS 
    takes a percentage of your <b>income</b>. But what is your <b>income</b>? 
    The IRS takes a percentage of your <b>Taxable Income</b>. <b>Your Taxable 
    Income is your Total Income minus Deductions. </b> I will show you some numbers 
    to show you why this is important.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Case 1</b><br>
    Total Income $50,000<br>
    Deductions $0<br>
    Taxable Income $50,000<br>
    Assuming IRS percentage of 40%, you pay $20,000 in taxes.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Case 2</b><br>
    Total Income $50,000<br>
    Deductions $10,000<br>
    Taxable Income $40,000<br>
    Assuming IRS percentage of 40%, you pay $16,000 in taxes. I don' know about 
    you, but I can take a nice vacation with $4,000.</p>
  <p align="left">The IRS provides what is called a <b>Standard Deduction </b>of 
    about $8,000 and most people use this number for their deductions. You should 
    use <b>Itemized Deductions</b> if your total deductions are greater than the 
    <b>Standard Deduction</b>. Most individuals use the Standard Deduction. Most 
    business use Itemized Deductions. <b>Rember that if you use Itemized Deductions 
    you must keep receipts for all deductions and you will need a guide such as 
    J.K. Lasser's. </b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Sale of home exclusion rules. </b>If you have lived in your 
    home for 2 to 5 years prior to sale of your home, a single tax payer does 
    not have to pay tax on the first $250,000 of the sale. Married home owners 
    may exclude $500,000 form capital gain tax.</p>
  <h2 align="left"><a name="gifts"></a>Understanding income tax and gifts</h2>
  <p align="left">It is also important to understand what the IRS means by gifts 
    and how it affects the individual giving and the individual receiving the 
    gift. </p>
  <p align="left">If you give someone $10,000 they will receive the $10,000 as 
    income. It will be added to their total yearly income and pay taxes on it.</p>
  <p align="left">If you put down on your taxes that you <b>Gifted</b> the $10,000, 
    and they put down on their taxes they were <b>Gifted</b> $10,000, it is different. 
    The person <b>giving</b> the money will pay a special IRS gift tax. The person 
    <b>receiving</b> the gift will pay no taxes, it will not be added to their 
    total yearly income, and will pay no taxes on the money.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Inheritance and gifts </b>You have a one million dollar lifetime 
    gift tax exclusion for gift tax. That means you can give away one million 
    dollars in your lifetime without paying a gift tax. (Total gift taxes and 
    probate tax free are added together, and will cannot be over one million.) 
    You must file the appropriate forms with the IRS. In addition you can give 
    away $11,000 per year without paying gift tax.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Contributions </b>Contributions are different from gifts. 
    When you give clothes to Goodwill, or give money to the church, you are making 
    a contribution. If you give $250 or less a cancelled check or reciept from 
    the charity is adequate. If you give items totalling over $250, the charity 
    must list the items on a reciept. It is up to you to prove the value of your 
    gifts. </p>

  <h2 align="left"><a name="Enron"></a>How to Attack the Enron Type Money Problem</h2>
  <p align="left">Enron managers siphoned off hundreds of millions in special 
    benefits and dividends for years before declaring bankruptcy. You take every 
    computer they have in their business and at home. You take the computers of 
    every service company they dealt with. You duplicate the data from every harddrive, 
    then you run a commercial program that reveals deleted data on the harddrive. 
    You put it all on one system. You index it using something like a google search 
    engine and you look around. You prosecute every individual with criminal law. 
    Then the lawyers pick up the class action against for civil penalties to recover 
    the money lost in pension plans, by going after one person at a time. Then

  <p>The following picture is from a Boy Scout book. The bowline is a knot that 
    will not slip. The loop stays the same size no matter how hard you pull. Almost 
    any ordinary knot you tie in a loop will pull closed. An ordinary knot tied 
    around you will cut you in two when pulled tight. It is also the most important 
    fishing knot. It is the knot used for the loop on 8 inch leaders for fishing 
    hooks. <a href="Bowline.jpg">Click here to link to a picture that describes

  <h2><a name="enigma"></a>The State and Enigmas of Being Human</h2>
  <p>Animals in the wild kill other animals, and at the same time take pleasure 
    in the kill which provides them food or dominance. There is no thought for 
    the pain experienced by the killed animal. This makes sadism in humans understandable. 
    It is just a twist where we take pleasure in the pain of others. </p>
  <p>A human quality which animals do not have, is the ability to think. The <b>feeling 
    quality for yourself quality </b>is pervasive in all human beings. It has 
    individual survival value. It allows you gain sympathy from other human beings; 
    it allows us to focus life on self without regard for others. It allows us 
    to act in our own interest, and at the same time justify ourselves without 
    accountability. After all, life cannot possibly be worse for anyone else than 
    it is for me.</p>
  <p>What is interesting to me is that the qualities we embrace in our daily lives, 
    are not the qualities we embrace as desirable in religion or the popular movies 
    we all watch. The qualities we embrace there are compassion, assertive action, 
    and accountability. Do we not see ourselves or do not want to see ourselves 
    or are we too weak or lazy to change? Typically humans are not fond of introspection, 
    Jesus was crucified. It may seem I am picking on Jews, but remember that Jesus 
    himself was Jewish. All religions have more in common than you may think.</p>
  <p>Well, only time will tell how much long term survival value there is in lack 
    of compassion and empathy for others. With enough nuclear weapons to kill 
    the planet several times over.</p>
  <h2><a name="tips-for-voices"></a>Tips To Make Those Voices Go Away</h2>
  <p> Mentally ill people receive signals from the environment that trigger thought 
    processes in their head. Often they feel the signals are associated with a 
    supernatural being. Sometimes they hear voices in their head that they believe 
    are from supernatural beings. Often they think this supernatural being is 
    God, and take the signals seriously enough to act on them. This may be true 
    because many of us are brought up as Christians and are taught in Church from 
    an early age that if you pray your prayers will be answered. People assume 
    there is a <b>voice</b> that answers your prayers, and that is not true. I 
    have learned through hard experience these signals or voices and the thoughts 
    they trigger will bring you only pain.</p>
  <p> <b>Jesus prayed, and his prayers were answered. But his prayers were never 
    answered by a voice; they were answered by a deed, such as peace of mind or 
    a healing. The only time God talked to Jesus is when he said &quot;you are 
    my son, with whom I am well pleased.&quot;</b></p>
  <p> If there is a voice in your mind or you receive some signal that has special 
    importance to you, you must ignore it. The only trick that works for me is 
    to tell myself that the devil or an evil spirit is talking to me. If you pray 
    for these things to go away and listen to the silence they will go away. If 
    you associate these experiences with the devil it will help them go away.</p>
  <p> <b>Remember that the Bible says God is not in the thundering storm or the 
    stormy sea, but in the silence. If you hear words in your mind it is not God. 
    If you acknowledge they are from the devil and listen to the silence, they 
    will go away. </b></p>
  <h2><a name="legal-action"></a>How to Store Notes, Research, and Perform Your 
    Own Legal Action</h2>
  <p>What do your need if you have your own system? You need a Pentium II (450 
    MHz) computer with 128MB RAM, or better with a NIC for a high speed connection($200), 
    a monitor ($75), keyboard and mouse ($15), a scanner ($60), a printer ($40), 
    a CD Burner ($50), Easy CD Creator Burning software($60), Norton antivirus 
    software ($60), Adobe Acrobat ($400), DSL or Cable connection ($50 per month), 
    a DSL or cable modem ($100), a Linksys or similar router so you don't get 
    hacked ($75). The minimum operating system is Window 98SE ($100) with Microsoft 
    Word 2000(Office 2000)($200). Using a Linksys Router and inexpensive switches($15) 
    you can network 20 computers easily. </p>
  <p>The real problem is you need someone to maintain this system.You will also 
    need help learning to use the programs. I would suggest a coop, such as a 
    senior center. In San Diego there are many adult education locations with 
    free access to computers and training. You can contact the San Diego Community 
    College District at 619-388-4670 or look at their web site at www.sandiegocet.net.</p>
  <p>What is essential in legal action is a trail of bread crumbs from start to 
    finish. If you suspect things are not going quite right, they probably aren't. 
    So you document everything. Of course you can simply keep written notes in 
    a file folder, and a daily log of all phone calls and conversations. But I 
    have many projects going and a computer is essential. At the end of the day 
    I scan each new page of notes or correspondence in the scanner using Adobe 
    Acrobat. <b>Remember: To scan papers, the papers have to be in ink or the 
    lettering will not show up in the scan.</b> I have projects arranged in folders, 
    and use descriptive names for the documents I scan in. The cool thing about 
    keeping all files in your computer with descriptive names is that you can 
    use the find utility on the Start Menu to quickly locate documents you misplace. 
    Keep all files in My Documents and burn two copies at the end of the day. 
    One stays in the room, and another in a safe location.You can leave your house 
    and go on a trip with peace of mind. Everything is on the little CD. I do 
    not recommend putting bank account numbers, social security numbers, birth 
    dates, or personal information that could be used in identity theft on your 
    computer.</p>
  <p>You will also require an email address. Use hotmail.com or yahoo.com to sign 
    up for a free email account. Those companies will be there for ever, it is 
    free, and you can access your email from their web page on any computer in 
    the world.</p>
  <p>If you are a do-it-yourselfer you need books. A good source to begin is Nolo 
    - Everyday Law for Everyday People. You can call for a catalogue at 1-800-728-3555 
    or go to their web site at <a href="http://www.nolo.com">www.nolo.com</a>. 
    It covers everything from presenting your case in court, to IRS audits, to 
    becoming a citizen, to forming your own non-profit corporation.</p>
  <p><br>
    <b>When your get involved in legal action their are many different forms the 
    court requires. Some of these are standard forms available over the internet 
    or through Nolo. But you will also need Microsoft Office with its pleadings 
    wizard that helps automate the form creation process (MS Word - File - New 
    - Legal Pleadings Tab). An additional tip, that many lawyers do not know is 
    that through Adobe Acrobat you can automate filling out legal forms that you 
    only have a hard copy of. Essentially you scan the form into your computer, 
    and fill it out on your computer. (Actually it will take a day two to get 
    through the learning curve on this.</b>)</p>
  <p>The other requirement is a high speed connection. This means cable or DSL. 
    If you have no resources go to your public library or local continuing education 
    center. Use www.google.com or www.ask.com to search for the information you 
    need. <b>Not matter where you are in life you must learn to use a search engine 
    like google.com or ask.com on the internet. Knowledge is power and it is all 
    there. </b></p>
  <h2><a name="noise-control"></a>Noise Control When You Sleep</h2>
  <p>Some people can sleep through anything and some people can't. Nothing in 
    the world will cure a loud stereo, except moving. Of course if you want revenge 
    you will drag them to court as per Nolo before you move (see above). For minor 
    noises earplugs are effective. Unfortunately when used regularly you tend 
    to get minor ear infections which require daily rinse with hydrogen peroxide 
    followed by water. A better solution is playing relaxation tapes as cover 
    noise. My favorite is a rainy day at the ocean. You can download it for personal 
    use here. You can play the MP3 file on your computer or burn a CD. You can 
    get auto repeat CD players for $30 at Walmart that will play a burned CD.

  <h2><a name="kaiser"></a>Kaiser Supplement to Medicare A and B is Good Deal</h2>
  <p>Call Kaiser for details about their supplemental plan for Medicare A and 
    B. It is $60 per month. Office visits are $20 each. There is a $500 deductible 
    for any length hospital visit. The great part is you pay $10 for a three month 
    supply of generic medication and $30 for a three month supply of brand name 
    medication. That's pretty good. You can cancel at any time if you don't like 
    it. </p>
  <h2><a name="british-neighbors"></a>We Could Learn a Mass Transit Lesson From 
    Our British Neighbors</h2>
  <p>I saw a good show on some educational channel on TV concerning the Metropolitan 
    layout of London. Everyone works in London and all the major services (hospital, 
    shopping, etc.) are in London, but no one lives there. The rail lines were 
    extended out of the city into the country. When you get far enough from the 
    city to cheap land, a little suburb was created from scratch by the rail company. 
    The development of the little town paid for the railway. Instant mass transit. 
    Everyone takes the railway to work. If you think Americans are going to be 
    commuting to work in their gas guzzlers for eternity, you are wrong. Reaching 
    retirement age this has especially strong appeal to me.</p>
  <h2><a name="animal-trap"></a>The Best Small Animal Trap Money can't Buy</h2>
  <p>Animal trapping is a lost art. I am disappointed with the design of most 
    small animal traps. The mechanical trigger mechanisms are not sensitive enough. 
    Of course an electric eye trigger is the ultimate, but I have a design for 
    the rest of the world. There is no reason to starve with a ready supply of 
    rats in the world. How do you think the Russians survived in their camps? 
    (Note article in U.S News and World Report - Stalin starved about 12 million 
    of his fellow peasant country men to death, essentially to break the backbone 
    of the middle class of farmers.) Anyway, here Dofusdaddy provides rough blueprints 
    for a good trap design. A very similar design was patented in the 1800's, 
    so it is freely available. The design is adaptable for a range of animals 
    from rats to larger animals. The use of a pressure plate trigger that releases 
    a gravity drop slide provides a sensitive trigger. <a href="My-Rodent-Trap-Design-Drawings.PDF">Click

    argue some phony patent infringement, forget it. No one is going to let you 
    tie it down. And if you do, it is so simple to make, that people just build 
    there own. Here are copies of the 1800's patent on which it is based. <a href="PN472687-1790-1975-Text.pdf">Click

  <h2><a name="linux"></a>Oh Yah! What About Linux?</h2>
  <p>I outlined what you need for a basic computer system above. Obviously the 
    by far largest cost is software. I wasn't go to get into this because I felt 
    Microsoft and Red Hat did us a service by monopolizing and standardizing the 
    operating systems. But the SCO lawsuit irritates me, and it looks like something 
    Microsoft would support (I have nothing against Microsoft, but they have enormous 
    clout.) SCO will not reveal the code they are talking about because they want 
    to scare Linux customers away. They know that Linux supporters would rewrite 
    the code top to bottom in a couple weeks, just for pure spite. What to do, 
    what to do?</p>
  <p>Linux has attracted the best and brightest programmers around the world. 
    But you guys keep improving and modifying the code every six months, so no 
    one can standardize applications for the operating system. Back to reality. 
    Do you want Linux to survive or not? Do you want to make some Money? Take 
    a stable version of Linux (something out for at least a year). Add Lindows 
    type software (to give a familiar feel), an Office package, burning software, 
    and PDF software. Remember all I care about is ease of use. I want to put 
    the disk in the computer, and be able to install the software without a million 
    menu choices. There should be no decisions to make. You put in one disk to 
    install the operating system, one disk for the Lindows feel, one disk for 
    the Office package, one disk for burning software, and one disk for PDF software. 
    You offer the software on a standard computer with a minimum Pentium II (450 
    MHz, 128 MB RAM, 10 GIG HD, NIC, Modem, CDROM, CD Burner, Floppy. You offer 
    package options with an inexpensive scanner, tray feed ink jet printer (no 
    more than $40), and inexpensive monitor - That work with the software installed. 
    You offer a ready supply of all parts for replacement. All we want to do is 
    write letters, get on the internet, scan papers into PDF format, print, and 
    burn back up copies. That's it. Then you write a good, comprehensive manual 
    that tells you everything, which is how to install the software and how to 
    use it (Keep on CD to keep costs down.) Take time to be sure this system is 
    idiot and moron basic. Take the average idiot off the street - like me - and 
    ask them to setup and install the system from your manual. If they can do 
    this, you have success. Then you walk over to your friendly Walmart marketing 
    executive and and tell him you have a computer system and software that really 
    works for $500. You add the scanner and printer for another $75. <b>I Know</b> 
    you can put the hardware together for $250. The CD Burner guy gets $10 for 
    each disk he sells you, the Office guy gets $10 for each disk he sells you, 
    the PDF guy gets $10 for each disk he sells you, the Lindows feel guy gets 
    $10 for each disk he sells you, the operating system guy gets $10 for each 
    disk he sells you. You cleared $200 on the system, and Walmart is the largest 
    retailer in the U.S. You do the math.(You do the same stuff RedHat does, the 
    fees are for support, or shipping and handling.)</p>
  <p>All the software I use is over three years old. I run Windows 98SE. I like 
    my system. Duplicate it in Linux and you will be the next Bill Gates. I am 
    pretty sure I can do this all by myself, and I am not a computer programmer. 
    But I do not have time now. This is child's play for anyone who knows anything 
    at all about Linux.</p>
  <h2><a name="iraq-occupation"></a>The Iraqi Occupation</h2>
  <p>Well, well how about the Iraqi occupation? There ain't a one man in the military 
    who wants to have our troops policing Iraq. So Bush wants an Iraqi commonwealth. 
    Why not just hire Iraqi troops, like the people of Iraq want? It is certainly 
    cheaper. Do you think we will succeed where the British failed? We proved 
    our point, and that is probably good enough.</p>
  <h2><a name="shotokan"></a>Shotokan Karate Martial Arts</h2>
  <p>I was involved in Karate in Little Tokyo in Los Angeles during my college 
    years. It was one of the most important influences in my life. We were fortunate 
    to have an extremely good leader. The classes were held in the auditorium 
    of a Catholic church school in a predominately Japanese neighborhood. Karate 
    takes gut wrenching effort. It will help you develop coordination and give 
    you spiritual strength. At this particular location there were no fees. There 
    was only one demand. Do your best and show up regularly. Classes were held 
    for one and half hours twice weekly during the evenings. As uncoordinated 
    and crummy as I was, effort was respected.</p>
  <h2><a name="prostitution"></a>The Taboo Subject - Prostitution</h2>
  <p>Prostitution adds revenue to organized crime syndicates, just like boot-legging 
    during prohibition. It is a basic vice that is not going to go away if you 
    turn your back. Make it legal, tax it, regulate it. Just like Nevada. I am 
    not proposing a hedonistic society. In fact I believe porno should outlawed. 
    It fuels un-natural lust. We are consumed with sexual thoughts the way it 
    is, without the help of porno.</p>
  <h2><a name="marijuana"></a>Marijuana - Should it be legal?</h2>
  <p>Marijuana sales adds revenue to organized crime syndicates, just like boot-legging 
    during prohibition. It is another vice that is not going away. It should be 
    legal to carry under an ounce. It should be legal to grow a limited number 
    of plants at your home. It should be illegal to drive under the influence, 
    or use outside the interior of your home. You should be able to use; but just 
    like alcohol, your break the rules, you go to jail.</p>
  <h2><a name="choice"></a>Choice or No Choice?</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately because I believe in tolerance, if they knew who I was, I wouldn't 
    put it past any extremist group to blow up my car. (Fortunately no one visits 
    this web site anyway. But it is cathartic treatment for me.) <br>
    Come on, its is a woman's body, <b>it is her choice. If you beleive strongly 
    that is murder, then you provide alternative funding and volunteers for care, 
    and adoption. It is their choice.</b></p>
  <h2><a name="euthanasia"></a>Legalize Euthanasia?</h2>
  <p>Formalization of euthanasia procedures has been established in Europe. Suicide 
    death has been a part of Japanese culture for centuries, as an honorable way 
    to pass to the next plane. I am not saying we should not pass out fentanyl 
    pads to every teenager on the street, but for the terminal ill, crippled, 
    and those in intractable pain it is logical. Give them the choice. Many people 
    believe in something beyond this world.</p>
  <h2><a name="masturbation"></a>Masurbation is Appropriate Behavior</h2>
  <p>I was brought up that masturbation was aberrant. This is wrong. Especially 
    young woman need to express and feel their sexuality, and it is something 
    to be celebrated in life. Repression of sexual feelings leads to frustration, 
    and uncontrolled sexual behavior. Masturbation is a natural release that allows 
    you to take control of your sexual behavior. It is as important for boys as 
    it is for girls.</p>
  <h2><a name="lake-mead"></a>The Lake Mead - Las Vegas area could be Utopia</h2>
  <p>Lake Mead is a huge reservoir. I am not going to get involved in who gets 
    the Colorado River water. But this type of model works anywhere. <br>
    So you say who wants to live in the Nevada desert? Lake Mead provides camping, 
    fishing, water skiing and sailing. The desert provides unlimited empty space 
    for off road vehicles. It is a great climate to sit around the pool and relax. 
    You build a transit rail system out of Vegas to a remote area where land costs 
    nothing. The water comes from Lake Mead. Instead of using electric air conditioners, 
    you cool with water pipes where the water is circulated though outdoor fountains 
    to cool the water. An unlimited number of mister could keep the temperature 
    cool around buildings. You differentiate between water used for human consumption 
    and that used for all other purposes. <br>
    The end result is a low cost living area with access to all the amenities 
    of the city. You could retire there and kick back. Or commute to your job. 
    <br>
    The alternative is living in a very expensive, crowded metropolitan area with 
    a much lower quality of life for your money.</p>
  <p>I am tired of listening to the people of the world complain. They have it 
    in their power to improve life dramatically. There is no utopia. There will 
    always be pain and suffering. But you should be able to see, that there are 
    many things we can do to improve our lot in life. But they all take effort. 
    It takes effort. <b>Effort in life, whether you succeed or fail is its own 
    reward.</b> Everyone is going to physically die, but most religions believe 
    there is existence after death. But if you cannot control your mind in life, 
    how do you think you can do it in the after life? You cannot change people. 
    There are consequences to your actions. You need tolerance. You need self 
    control. Does somebody really have to pound each nail for you and wipe your 
    but in the morning?</p>
  <h2><b><a name="hitler"></a>Hitler had the Right Idea!</b></h2>
  <p>It is really not cost effective to care for the weak, elderly, mentally ill, 
    or sick. Euthanize them all. Of course you will never get old, be sick, or 
    know someone with a mental illness, you are immortal. Just like Hitler.</p>
  <h2><a name="demons-and-angels"></a>Demons and Angels</h2>
  <p>A short conversation with a born again Christian prompted me to do a little 
    quick internet surfing. Apparently humans were created somewhat in God's image. 
    Angels are special creations that are not human and can be good and bad. On 
    earth these angels can take human form or spirit form. In spirit form they 
    can possess or influence people. Satan's primary game is deceit. He always 
    takes the form of propriety or even that of a religious figure. Angels possess 
    no special knowledge. That is why trusting in them blindly or praying to them 
    is dangerous. Many false prophets who have prayed to God have received bad 
    information, and are deceived. They beleive they act on God's behalf, but 
    have been mislead. The born again Christian claims he listens to the still 
    small voice of God, that guides him. The real problem is how do you know the 
    still small voice of God is God or a deceiver. Remember some of the most terrible 
    acts in history were performed in the name of righteousness by someone just 
    as convinced as you are he is acting on God's behalf. Open your mind. The 
    Palestinian suicide bomber in Israel believes so strongly that all Jews are 
    evil that he is willing to die for it. He knows he will go to heaven for his 
    acts. The Puritan witch trials, the European witch trials, and the Spanish 
    Inquisition. Terrible tortures were performed until a confession was gained 
    from the accused. And since they always confessed they knew they were always 
    right. Generally the accused were in some way different from themselves or 
    an adversary. The point is your need to be tolerant, you do not always know 
    what is right, and you could be wrong. </p>
  <h2><a name="trades"></a>Buying or Selling Real Estate and Real Estate Trades</h2>
  <p>Everything you need to know about IRS 1031 trades is in the book Brief Exchanges 
    by Investment Property Exchange Services, Inc. Their web site is www.ipx1031.com. 
    Briefly, you must exchange a home for a home or commercial for commercial. 
    You cannot trade your home for commercial property. Why do an IRS 1031 trade? 
    Because you pay no IRS taxes on the sale of your property. Remember that the 
    deadline for identifying a property to trade for is 45 days after the close 
    of your property, and the deadline for closing on the upleg property is 180 
    days after closing on your property. The trade must set up with an intermediary 
    escrow company.</p>
  <p>Loopnet.com is the best place to identify commercial properties. A premium

  <p>If you are investing in California real estate you need the following books. 
    <b>The Complete Guide to Your Real Estate Closing</b> by Sandy Gadow, which 
    discusses escrow procedures. Escrow holds the deeds and money which go to 
    buyer and seller. You should also get <b>California Real Estate Law</b> by 
    William Pivar, which is the basis for real estate contracts in California. 
    You will be signing a real estate contract when you list your property with 
    a real estate agent. Remember the seller pays 6% commission out of the sale 
    price which goes to the buyer's and seller's real estate agents. 3% to seller's 
    real estate agent. 3% to buyer's real estate agent.</p>

  <h2><a name="arnold"></a>So Arnold Wants to be Governor</h2>
  <p>Surround yourself at public functions every night with attractive, intelligent 
    press secretaries, Hollywood and other celebrities. Get picture bites of him 
    at the functions with these woman or his wife Maria Shriver into every evening 
    newscast you can. Fishnet stockings are very popular and look attractive. 
    Surround him with charismatic happy women. Do the Tonight Show and have Maria 
    Shriver do all the talking. Arnold, just smile, the woman already adore you. 
    Look like the screen idol you are, not a serious politician. Maria Shriver 
    is attractive, presents well and talks well. She can easily win it for him 
    with her presence by his side in prime time commercials. They should both 
    talk in the commercials. Have your economic advisor endorse you. &quot;I support 
    Arnold, together we can bring an era of prosperity to California, the 6th 
    largest economy in the world.&quot; A smiling duo male, female police officers 
    &quot;San Diego Law enforcement supports Arnold for governor.&quot; There 
    is no need for him to talk or debate, President Bush never does. Others answer 
    the press for him. They must be attractive and intelligent. (Unlike Bush's). 
    Because he presents well, many people think he is the best man for the job 
    and can get things done. Emphasize his support and endorsement by intellectuals 
    and professionals who will bring prosperity to California.You must support 
    woman's rights (you don't have to say which ones). You support the hard working 
    minorities who have helped make California great. You don't need to pinpoint 
    general issues. We want prosperity. <br>
    A note on actors. Actors are often put down for one reason or another. The 
    truth is acting require a great deal of self discipline and dedication. Qualities 
    I wish we found more often in our people in political office. One man who 
    tries hard is worth ten who think they know what they are doing.</p>

  <p>While working in at Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, I did some amateur gold panning 
    in the Anchorage area. I had a great time and got the gold bug when I saw 
    my first few flakes. I panned at an established claim where they charged $10 
    per day for equipment and you kept all the gold you found. The most I ever 
    got was about $45 in a day, but I enjoyed it. I was willing to admit my inexperience 
    and the owners encouraged me to ask the other prospectors for advice. They 
    were gruff but friendly, and I soon learned the in's and outs's. Recently 
    I checked out the situation on the internet for California gold prospecting. 
    Essentially all BLM and Forest Service lands in California and Alaska have 
    been thoroughly prospected, and claims established on all the likely sites. 
    Claim jumping is not looked upon in a freindly manner. But there are a couple 
    areas in California that are open recreation lands set aside for anyone to 
    prospect on. The largest one is <a href="http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=502">Auburn 
    State Recreation Area</a>. The other is a small area in <a href="http://www.ca.blm.gov/news/2002/10/nr/CCnews07_Goldfields/Conv.htm">Yuba 
    County.</a> I also suggest joining the <a href="http://www.goldprospectors.org/">Gold 
    Prospectors Association of America.</a> There are many day trips and sites 
    available around the city of Sonora, California in the heart of the Gold Country.</p>

  <h2><a name="happiness"></a>What is Happiness? Is it What You Want the Most?</h2>
  <p>Happiness is look of trust when you tuck a child in at night. Happiness is 
    comforting words when you are in trouble. Happiness is the sense of peace 
    in a relationship. Do your want something else, or do you want happiness most 
    of all?</p>
  <h2><a name="straw-bale"></a>Straw Bale Building - The Future May be Here.</h2>
  <p>Straw bale houses look the same as any other house. The roof is traditional, 
    but the inside and outside walls are stucco over straw bales. The strength 
    of the house comes from steel poles, and box beam plywood panels. The house 
    is every bit as fire resistant as any other type of house construction, since 
    the walls are stucco. The advantage is that the walls are two foot thick, 
    and provide incredibly good insulation. </p>
  <p>I saw an article in the San Diego Union Tribune on September 21st concerning 
    building with straw bale. I plan on building an addition onto my house as 
    a show case for straw bale building. I will let you follow along step by step 
    at this website. Actually the sole reason for this small building project 
    is to provide material for this web site and a book later on. It is touted 
    as less expensive construction, energy efficient and something you can build 
    yourself with general construction knowledge. We will see. I will track costs 
    of architectural design, any difficulties in permit approval with the San 
    Diego planning commission, compare total construction costs to traditional 
    construction costs, and compare energy efficiency to traditional construction. 
    I have prepared designs, and checked zoning requirements for the stand alone 
    addition. I contacted Hubbell &amp; Hubbell Architects in San Diego to estimate 
    the cost of plans that are required for approval of construction permits. 
    Remember that any individual can build a house himself, you do not have to 
    be a contractor. But it does take a great deal of time, effort, money, and 
    paperwork. You need to carefully read all the free pamphlets provided by the 
    planning commission. This simple 850 sq. ft. stand alone addition will cost 
    about $60,000. It consists of a small living room, bedroom, bathroom, and 
    kitchen. And this is doing most of the labor, including electrical and plumbing 
    myself. Hopefully people will advertise on this web site and buy the book 
    so I recover the costs. <a href="straw-bale/index.htm">You can follow my progress

  <h2><a name="social-services"></a>The Question of Social Services</h2>
  <p> A lot of people aren't going to like what I say here. Life is not fair. 
    Americans make up a very small portion of the world's population and conusme 
    90% of the world's non-renewable resources. I live in California, with the 
    sixth largest econcomy in the world. There will always be people who don't 
    produce. But they still have mother's, father's, sisters, and brother's who 
    care about them. We will need board and cares to provide subsistence living 
    for the elderly, severly disabled, and mentally ill. If we are going to keep 
    incarcerating people we need more prisons. Most of them are triple the capacity 
    they are desgined for. I find California's mental health system acceptable, 
    and its laws for treating the relatively few mentally ill who commit crimes 
    as mostly fair. The level of care provided to people with no dental coverage 
    is adequate. I do not agree with the laws concerning prostitution, and drugs 
    abuse. I do believe that even lazy people who don't work have the right to 
    somewhere to sleep, food, emergency medical and dental care. They do not have 
    the right to disrupt the lives of others who do work, put effort into life, 
    pay taxes and essentially support their existence. The mass transit systems 
    need to be improved. Their needs to be zero tolerance for disruptive behavior 
    on buses, trolleys, and on public streets. We need more men on the police 
    force and it needs to be well defined what their goals are each day. Their 
    are going to be inequalities in the health care benefits provided. The rich 
    can afford top medical insurance and will live longer. The middle class need 
    a government regulated system with moderate health care guarentees. They will 
    not have access to transplants and high costs medical procedures. They will 
    die sometimes because they cannot afford to extend their life with an expensive 
    procedure. The poor are entitled to emergency medical care only. Everyone 
    is entitled to be treated with dignity and receive the same <b>quality</b> 
    of care, but they will not have access to the <b>same operations or types 
    of treatment</b>. Adults and children are seen differently in the eyes of 
    God and we need to see them differently too. They need access to higher levels 
    of care than adults; whether rich, poor, or middle class. I like California's 
    education system. Their are many adult education opportunities that are free. 
    Junior colleges are relatively cheap and should remain so. As we are finding 
    out now, our country is in a recession and their are only so many dollars 
    to go around. The money it costs to keep me in intensive care for a couple 
    weeks could pay for living expenses and tuition for two years at a junior 
    college for my daughter. I have an Advanced Health Care Directive to keep 
    me off life support. You see, life depends on a belief system. I do not believe 
    this world is the end, because I know life on this world is not fair. But 
    we need to do the best we can with what we have. As I tell my daughter repeatedly, 
    effort in life is its own reward. Success or failure is not important at all.</p>

  <h2><a name="schizophrenia"></a>Schizophrenia </h2>
  <p>Yes indeed, I am one of the lucky people with the disease schizophrenia. 
    It is a terrible disease. Nine out ten people who commit suicide are mentally 
    ill or have substance abuse problems. One in ten schizophrenics commits suicide. 
    For professionals, including doctors and dentists the suicide rate is one 
    in two hundred and fifty. The suicide rate in the general population is one 
    in a thousand. One in three mentally ill people who visit a psychiatrist has 
    thought about how they will commit suicide during the past year. The disease 
    is probably caused by a general condition in the brain where by nerves are 
    actived too easily. Medications that depress dopamine, a neurotransmitter, 
    are used to control the disease. That is why mental patients in hospitals 
    look doped or have a blank look about them. The medications suppress brain 
    activity, acting like a potent depressant. It has taken 20 years of therapy 
    for me to be able to put into words what I experience the world like. I believe 
    all schizophrenics have similar experiences, but I cannot talk for them, so 
    I will use the word <b>I</b>. I am an intensely sensitve person, and my mind 
    reaches out for connections with the environment. Trains of thought are activated 
    easily by every day noises, or body language in people that you ignore. A 
    single thought from what I call <b>signals, </b>agitates an intense process 
    of thinking. Unchecked, thoughts over the period of several hours result in 
    what psyciatrists call a delusion, which is a fixed false belief. Over a period 
    of days, weeks, or months conspiracy theories are formed. Because these are 
    fixed false belief, they are retained as fact in your mind. Treatment with 
    medication will end the thought cycling, but the fixed belief is an experience 
    that is retained as factual. The only way to deal with these often pervese 
    factual conspiracies is to try to forget them, or develop a belief system 
    that allows you to deal with the perversity of life. I can tell myself I was 
    delusional, but my mind always retains the &quot;delusions&quot; as real. 
    How can I deal with the perverse evil I perceive has been inflicted on me 
    by people in the past? First, I have to accept that life is unfair. Second, 
    I have to believe that God will even things out in the after life. I feel 
    an obligation to do as God tells me, but I must fear and respect societies 
    rules to survive. The problem here is what does God want? Many schizophrenics 
    interpret noises as signals from ethereal beings. Some even hear voices directly 
    talking to them. These ethereal beings can be God, the devil, angels, guardian 
    angels, or evil spirits. The voices often sound like a real person they have 
    had contact with. Off and on over the years I have experienced the feeling 
    these ethereal beings exist through signals, and occassionally through voices. 
    The first times I experienced this at Patton I thought was they were a guardian 
    angel, personified by a female psychologist. The day before I committed my 
    crime I thought I heard a distant older male voice taunting me. Ocassionly 
    in the past few years I have experienced signals from TV that give me a feeling 
    there are beings outside the human plane who influence life around us. At 
    first I thought they were freindly, then I began to realize that if they existed, 
    these beings brought me nothing but pain. Asking God to remove these thoughts, 
    or evil spirits as I saw them, seemed to work. When I thought about it, I 
    realized I never heard what I could actually say was Jesus or God influencing 
    activities. When I focused on the quiet, that I felt was God, I could make 
    the feelings that there were other beings go away. Both of my recent psychiatrists 
    have commented that the prophets, or shamans were probably schizophrenics. 
    I am not a prophet. I am introverted, and averse to public contact. Contact 
    with other humans is very stressful, if not actually painful. But I can see 
    that the feelings that there are spirits could make you a very convincing 
    prophet. All religions beleive in the after life and spiritual beings. If 
    you are Christian you beleive in God and angels in heaven. You believe in 
    the devil, guardian angels, demons, and spirits on earth. Many people beilieve 
    spirits can possess you and act through you. My concern here is false prophets. 
    Incredible atrocities are committed in the name of religious beliefs. Are 
    you sure that the voice that guides you is not an evil spirit deceiving you 
    for his amusement? Personally, the only peace I achieve in life is when I 
    listen to the quiet that is God. Angels have no special knowledge. Special 
    knowlegdge only comes from within and through the quiet that is God. This 
    special knowledge is <b>compassion, and empathy for other people. All people.</b></p>
