<p><strong>Annual meet of IISH members<br /></strong>As in the previous years,   the annual meet of IISH members will be  held at National Heritage Centre of IISH, Mazhuvanchery, near Kechery, Trissur Guruvayur highway, Trissur on 2nd October, 2008  (04885-240236 /09446361149)</p><p><strong> EDITORIAL THOUGHTS</strong></p><p><strong>The terrorism  in Keralam.<br /></strong>For many centuries, Kerala used to be the source of  great  inspiration for  all Indians    because of the contributions made by  many Rushies from  this state. Kerala’s contribution to arts, science, technology, literature, and so on are  memorable.  Sree Sankaracharya united this nation   by establishing four  matts  in the four corners of Bharath……these  are all  becoming the story of the past. Now Kerala is becoming  the source for many negatives…..the muscle power of  minority is  spreading through out the country from Kerala…the terrorism messages are going from Keralam……. The bombs  used by the   terrorists  are stored in this Parasurama Kshetra. All the political nuisances, hartals, bandhs, destruction of  temples and aasrams   have become the part of the day today  news  in Kerala.  We request all Indians  never  try to copy Keralam  which, once upon a time  was an ideal model for  all other states of India….<br /><strong>Freedom of the press!<br /></strong>Something unique  appears to happen thorough out the country.  The  print and  e media  are becoming more and more impartial  and unbiased.  This appears to very clear  in many TV channels and  national   and regional newspapers. Let the media  not produce   the reflection of the what is  happening in the society. Let the media  produce and re-produce what should happen in the  society and nation…. Let them become the guiding force  for one  and all independent of the  caste, religion, political lenience  and regional partiality. <br /><strong>India is again getting divided.<br /></strong>The Muslim organizations and few intellectuals are  taking the side of  diving India  again in the name of religion. This freedom of expression is used  only for appeasing the minority community of  Muslims.  After  sixty years of independence  the politicians have not  solved  any crucial and fundamental problems  but created  many    exclusively due to  the  selfish interest to grab  power in the states and  centre. Without far sightedness, the politicians  created  many problems  which can never be  solved  by anyone at any time.  In the name of  nationality  and secularism our politicians  have  destroyed (are destroying) our nation. They are/ were doing the same  thing for the  last six decades….<br /><strong>A new movie  and love affair politics!</strong><br />Mahathma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru  and many others   are role model for every Indians…. Now,  a news  appeared in   print media  says that  a movie  is being produced  on the  love affairs between  Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru  and the wife of Lord Mount Batten …………… a Sad  story of role model’s for Indians…..second love affair  also ruled India….. third   love affair is  now ruling India  and yet  the fourth is  going to rule India.  After   the independence,  Indians were  ruled (ruling  and perhaps will be ruled)  for 80 % of the sixty one years   by those who are the part of  love  affairs.</p><p>N. Gopalakrishnan, September –October 2008     </p><p><br /><strong>The background sad story of Chicago Lecture of Swami Vivekananda.</strong> <br />Swami wanted to visit  the west…he expressed his desire to  attend the parliament of religion to be held in Chicago in 1893……..He reviewed his experience of the past , present and  future of  mother India  and the causes of her downfall…..The picture of  ancient India appeared before his eyes  vividly in all its grandeur  and glory  and the contrast   was unbearable to the saint….some enlightened people in different part of India had previously advised him to go to the west…. he took  the decision to go to west for uplifting Bharath… the money received by begging and also  received as the blessings from the Maharajas was used for the journey……Swami reached Chicago at the end of July  via Colombo……. He was shocked to learn that  the  parliament of religion will commence only  in September…  and no delegate would be admitted without proper  credentials from organizations….he came to know the final selection of the delegates  was also over…. Swami did not foresee all these problems…he knew living in Chicago is costly  that too without money in his hand…. He left to Boston… on the way he met a lady  Miss Katherine Abbot Sanborn a co traveler in  the train…. She invited  Vivekananda to her home  and introduced  to a Greek Professor of Harvard University……. After six hours discussion, the professor could understand  the depth of knowledge of  swami and he said “ asking a credential to you is like asking the sun to state  its right to shine”…… he recommended  to the chairman of the  parliament…..” here is  a man  who is more learned than all our professors put together “  Unfortunately when  he reached Chicago  on 9th September, he found he had mislaid the address of the Committee…. The chilling September started  and he had to  find shelter  in an empty boxcar  in the railroad… he slept there trusting in the guidance of  Lord… after that he walked  and came to  the corner of rich quarters of the city  and sought  help from house to house begging… many shut their doors  seeing  his  dirty clothes  many treated him rudely   and some slammed the  doors too… he sat down on the road side. Just then the door of a fashionable residence opposite him opened and a lady of regal appearance came out and spoke to him in soft voice…. She invited   him and  gave food…. She took him to the office of the  Parliament of religions  and he could became a delegate  and was lodged with the oriental guests. .. his deliverer  was Mrs. George W Hale …. Swami was convinced that  the Lord was with him…… behind every achievement and recognition  there are stories  of pain and sufferings…</p><p><strong>PINGALA UPANISHAD<br /></strong>Pingala Upanishad is the  11th among the Sukla Yajurvedic Upanishads. It is presented as the discussion between Maharshi yajnavalkhya and his disciple Pingala, in four chapters. In the first chapter  following points are described. 1. The cosmic power and its relation with brahma chaitanya. 2. The colors of  the Brahmam.3. saathwika, raajasika and thaamasika  gunas present in this. 4.   The brahma chaitanyam is said to be filled in universe hence explained  as brahmaanda. Ie. Brahma + anda = brahmaanda. 5.  The awareness and consciousness existing in the universe is explained as the manifestation of the Brahmam itself : prajnaaanam brahma.  6.   From that  prajnaan ( awareness and consciousness) the  creation of the  ahamkaaram  (aham + kaaram) = swabhodham  takes place. 7. It is the  awareness and consciousness with correct direction (pathway)! So as to follow the manifestation and manipulation of that Brahmam ( awareness and consciousness) in all living and non living beings. 8. Defining and explaining this cosmic energy  as  prapancha purusha chaitanya  for symbolically presenting the brahmaanda concept.  9. Further presenting that cosmic energy  symbolically as Mahavishnu . 10. The formation of the pancha bhootha  from awareness and consciousness as pruthvi, ap, theja., vaayu, akaasa, + ahankaara  from macrocosm. ( the last one is the consciousness in microcosm). 11. Formation of  the elements  from  pancha bhootha and  from that the materials/compounds. 12. The formation of the material world  from these molecules. 12. From those  molecules  formed  each and every living and non living beings, including animals and plants with jeeva chaitanya (praana) in them. 13. From the molecules, the  cells, from the cells the tissues including the  sensory organs and  functional organs were formed  says the first chapter of the Pingala Upanishad.  ( this  explanation has  great similarity to the  evolution theory  and  beyond that). The second chapter of the Pingala Upanishad  is  the  answers given by Maharshi Yajnavalkhya  for the question “ how  the  divine power  manifested  as jeevaathma ?” asked by his disciple. Yajnavalkhya said 1.  The formation of pancha bhootha has taken place first.  2. In this panchabhootha based  body  the feelings  were  created/ generated  after the creation of the organs from pancha boothas. 3. Then formed the feelings like hunger, thirst, heat , cold, etc.  4. These are  created from the  agni/ theja part of the pancha bhootha. 5. All the body movements,  oxygen and air  transfer, etc  are linked  with the  vaayu part of the panchabhootha. 6. The desire, anger, jealousy,  and all the mental attitudes were generated from aakaasa ( part of the pancha bhootha)7. Then the five  state of praana  were  created  as praana – apaana – vyaana – udaana – samaana.  8. Each part of the body / organ has been attributed to one or more of the divine natural forces. 9. Each organ has  five  major foundation parameters  as annamaya kosha- praana maya kosha – manomaya kosha – vijanaanamaya kosha – aanandamaya kosha.  10. Through these pancha bhootha constituents and pancha praanas  the divinity of the nature gets manifested in body, said Yajnavalkhya Maharshi. 11. In the 3rd  chapter excellent explanation of four  mahavakyaas are given.  These  mahavakyaas are connected with the Vedas. From Rig-Veda  prajnaanam brahma, from Yajurveda, aham brahmasmi, from Sama Veda thathwam asi and from  Atharva Veda  the ayam athma brahma , (four) mahavakyaas were taught (these four mahavakyas are from the four  Upanishads  belonging respectively to the four Vedas)  12. In the 4th  chapter  the  sanyaasa charyas (acharas) and the qualifications of the  Vedic scholars who has practically implemented the Vedic messages in their life are explained.  13. The state at which the  aathma and paramaathma become one is explained as parama pada praapthi of the jeevaathma.<br /><br /><strong>VIDUROPADESHA<br /></strong>cont’d  from last issue):………..<br />51.Nothing  can affect  a person with patience. <br />52. Like the fire automatically puts off in a bare land, the  cruel actions will not affect a man with patience. <br />53. Dharma leads to glory;  Patience leads to peace;  Non violence  leads to happiness. <br />54. Like a self hiding frog in a  hole is  eaten by a snake, a manager getting himself isolated ( who does not protect  his  colleagues) get destroyed by the enemy. <br />55. Two great  qualities of a manager  are  never using harsh words and  never serving the   bad people. <br />56. Never follow the words of bad people  <br />57. Two sharp thorns  which can create pain are, desiring for a luxuries life even when remaining poor without doing work  and getting angry even when incapable of doing anything. <br />58. A family member should never keep without engaging himself in work and a sanyaasi should never lead a luxurious  life. <br />59. Two types  of people  are above the heaven they are those who have patience even when they are very powerful  and the other  spending money for charity even  if they are poor.<br />60. Two types of mis-utilizations of the wealth are  donating to the non-deserving  and not  donating to the  deserving. <br />61. There are three pathways for human beings  saatwic, raajasic and thaamasic.  <br />62. There are three types of people  utthama, madhyama and adhama, depute them to the work   according to their nature. <br />63. Never try to grab others property, wife and never  give up the close friends. <br />64. Kaama (over expectations and desires) , krodha ( anger)  and lobha (miserly) are the three gates for the hell. <br />65. Getting a boon + coming back to own country + getting a son together  will be equal to  winning   the enemy (when the achievements are compared). <br />66. Never give up our devotees, servants and those who approached for help.   <br />67. Never  disclose the secrets with  idiots, people having farsightedness, those who are doing the things very fast  and those who flatter during discussion. <br />68. A family member (gruhastha) should protect four types of people , old aged,   scholar living in poverty, friend  living in poverty  and the sister who does not  have children. <br />69. The blessings of god, prediction of  scholars, humility of great men  and destruction of sinners  are the four which may take  place at any time.  <br />70. Always protect father, mother, teacher  and the  noble  flame in the prayer hall.</p><p><strong>ACHIEVEMENTS OF IISH (August – September 2008)</strong></p><p>@ Many lectures were organized in various parts of Kerala in the first part of the month <br />@ Two new CDs were released.@ Veda pracharana varsha is picking up fast <br />@ Latest fire brand  CD of IISH  Malayalam  “Purogama  vaadikalum, yukti vadikalum , buddhijevikalum pinne aal daivangalum has been released <br />@ A series 28 lectures were organized in various districts of Keralam  and Kanyakumari district of  TN. <br />@ Lecture programs in Chennai IIT, universities, cultural and spiritual organizations in  Madras in the middle of the month <br />@Lectures were delivered in Southern Railways Madras for the top officials of Southern Railway Division.<br />@ special lectures were organized for Accountant General Officers, Kendriya Vidyalayas, in Kerala. and in Bombay and in  Malapuram district of Kerala,  during the second half @ The second floor concreting  of Bharatheeya Vidya Vihar is completed. <br />@ Janmashtami  and Independence day were  celebrated  at National heritage center of IISH  in Trissur.</p><p><strong>Message of Chanakya given in neetisara:</strong>  No austerity measures up to calmness, No joy  is better than self satisfaction; No diseases is worse than greed, and no religion cuts above compassion (2.6)<br />The deity dwells not n a piece of wood, In a stone or in a clay model;   in faith  surely is He, therefore , it’s faith, in the deity which is fundamental.

( Do not translate the bhiskhaatana word as begging. accepting bhiskhsa and giving bhiksha are two holiest dharma). 1.
