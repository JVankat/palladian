<p> </p>
<p><i>This report 
was first posted on the web on the morning of July 1. Since then, I've revised 
several sections in response to reader requests for clarifications, and have 
added additional deceits which have been pointed out by readers or journalists. 
As a result, the number of listed deceits has been raised from 56 to 59.  
As of October 2, 2004, there have been 1,036,219 page views of the full report.</i></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>
Thanks to the readers who have written to point out additional deceits or to 
point out items which need clarification. Also thanks to the readers who have 
written in defense of Moore. Many such readers have been rational and civil. Moore's 
reasonable defenders have made two main points: </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>First, 
notwithstanding the specific falsehoods, isn't the film as a whole filled with 
many important truths? </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Not really. We can divide the film into three major 
parts. The first part (Bush, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan) is so permeated with 
lies that most of the scenes amount to lies. The second, shortest part 
involves domestic issues and the USA PATRIOT Act. So far, I've identified only one 
clear falsehood in this segment (Rep. Porter Goss's toll-free number). So this 
part, at least arguably, presents useful information. The third part, on 
Iraq, has several outright falsehoods--such as the Saddam regime's murder of 
Americans, and the regime's connection with al Qaeda. Other scenes in the third 
part--such as Iraqi casualties, interviews with American 
soldiers, and the material on bereaved mother Lila Lipscomb--are not blatant 
lies; but the information presented is so 
extremely one-sided (the only Iraqi casualties are innocents, nobody in Iraq is 
grateful for liberation, all the American soldiers are disillusioned, except for 
the sadists) that the overall picture of the Iraq War is false.</i></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Second, say the 
Moore supporters, what about the Bush lies? </i></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Well there 
are lies from 
the Bush administration which should concern everyone. For example, the Bush 
administration <a href="http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/8164060.htm">suppressed data</a> from its own Department of Health and Human 
Services which showed that the cost of the new Prescription Drug Benefit would 
be much larger than the administration claimed. This lie was critical to passage 
of the Bush drug benefit bill. Similarly, Bush's characterization of his 
immigration proposal as not granting &quot;amnesty&quot; to illegal aliens is quite 
misleading; although the Bush proposal does not formally grant amnesty, the 
<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040416-120211-3587r.htm">net 
result</a> is the same as widespread amnesty. As one immigration reform group
<a href="http://www.fairus.org/Media/Media.cfm?ID=2344&c=34">put it</a>, &quot;Any 
program that allows millions of illegal aliens to receive legal status in this 
country is an amnesty.&quot; Readers who want a scathing, and factually 
reliable, critique of the Bush administration might enjoy James Bovard's new 
book </i>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/140396727X/davekopel-20/">
The Bush Betrayal</a> <i>(Palgrave MacMillan, 2004). (Free excerpt
<a href="http://www.patronsaintpr.com/samples/LFB/spooner3.htm">here</a>.) Another good choice is </i>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743262514/kopel-20/">All the 
President's Spin</a>: George W. Bush, the Media, and the Truth<i>, by Ben Fritz, 
Bryan Keefer, and Brendan Nyhan (Touchstone, 2004).</i></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>But two wrongs 
don't make a right, and the right response to Presidential lies is not more lies 
from his political opponents. Moreover, regarding the issues presented in </i>
Fahrenheit 9/11<i>, the evidence of Bush lies is extremely thin. Moore shows Bush 
claiming that a particular day at the ranch in Crawford, Texas, was a working 
vacation, but Bush appears to be dissembling. Later, after Osama bin Laden was 
driven into hiding but was not captured, Bush unconvincingly claims not to spend 
much time thinking about bin Laden. Within </i>Fahrenheit 9/11<i>, most of the rest 
of alleged Bush administration lies actually involve Moore's fabrications to 
create the appearance of a lie--such as when Moore chops a Condoleezza Rice 
quote to make her say something when she actually said the opposite. </i></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The one 
significant Bush administration lie exposed in the film involves the so-called 
USA PATRIOT Act; as</i> Fahrenheit<i> accurately claims, at least some of the 
material in the USA PATRIOT Act had nothing to do with 9/11, and instead involved 
long-sought items on the FBI agenda which had previously been unable to pass 
Congress, but which were enacted by Congress under Bush administration 
assurances that they were essential to fighting terrorism. </i></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>If 
you look up the noun &quot;deceit&quot; in the dictionary, you will find that the 
definitions point you to the verb &quot;deceive.&quot; According to </i>Webster's 9th New 
Collegiate Dictionary,<i> the main (non-archaic or obsolete) definition of 
&quot;deceive&quot; is &quot;to cause to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid.&quot; 
Although the evidence in this report demonstrates dozens of plain deceits by 
Moore, there are some &quot;deceits&quot; in this report regarding which 
reasonable people may disagree. So if you find me unpersuasive on, for example, 
three alleged deceits, consider this article to have identified &quot;Fifty-six 
Deceits&quot; rather than fifty-nine. Whether or not you agree with me on every 
single item, I think you will agree that the evidence is undeniable that </i>
Fahrenheit 9/11 <i>is filled with deceit.</i></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Quite 
obviously, there are many patriotic Americans who oppose George Bush and who 
think the Iraq War was a mistake. But Moore's deceitful movie offers nothing 
constructive to help people form their opinions. To use lies and frauds to 
manipulate people is contrary to the very essence of democracy, which requires 
people to make rational decisions based on truthful information. It's wrong when 
a President lies. It's wrong when a talk radio host lies. And it's wrong when a 
film-maker lies.</font></i></p>
<hr>

<p><i>July 
11 update: Moore's response.</font></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>
Moore's &quot;War Room&quot; has published a lengthy point-by-point defense of the movie. 
Some of the points relate to issues I've raised; others do not. For each item 
below, I'll provide a link to Moore's response, when there is one. On two 
issues (Afghanistan's President Karzai; John Ashcroft's pre-9/11 attitude 
towards terrorism) Moore's response makes 
some valid points; not necessarily that </i>Fahrenheit <i>is right on these facts, 
but at least the facts are disputable. On one issue (the unemployment rate 
in Flint), Moore is clearly right. On the rest of the items I've identified, 
Moore's responses are extremely unconvincing, mainly because they so often evade 
the evidence.</i></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The 
key to Moore's response, and to the movie itself, is summarized by Boston 
University Law Professor
<a href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2004_07_00.shtml#1088978471">Randy 
Barnett</a>:</font></i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>...I was struck by the sheer 
cunningness of Moore's film. When you read Kopel, try to detach yourself from 
any revulsion you may feel at a work of literal propaganda receiving such 
wide-spread accolades from mainstream politicos, as well as attendance by your 
friends and neighbors. <br>
<br>
Instead, notice the film's meticulousness in saying only (or mostly) &quot;true&quot; or 
defensible things in support of a completely misleading impression. In this 
way, Kopel's care in describing Moore's &quot;deceits&quot; is much more interesting 
than other critiques I have read, including that of
<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723/">Christopher Hitchens</a>. Kopel's 
lawyerly description of Moore's claims shows the film to be a genuinely 
impressive accomplishment in a perverse sort of way (the way an ingenious 
crime is impressive)--a case study in how to convert elements that are mainly 
true into an impression that is entirely false--and this leads in turn to 
another thought. <br>
<br>
If this much cleverness was required to create the inchoate &quot;conspiracy&quot; 
(whatever it may be, as it is never really specified by Moore), it suggests 
there was no such conspiracy. With this much care and effort invested in 
uncovering and massaging the data, if there really <i>was</i> a conspiracy of 
the kind Moore suggests, the evidence would line up more neatly behind it, 
rather than being made to do cartwheels so as to be &quot;true&quot; but 
oh-so-misleading. If the facts don't fit, shouldn't we acquit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>(By the way, a reader responding 
to Barnett's July 4 post criticized some aspects of my report. In subsequent 
drafts, I've revised the article in response to some of those criticisms.)</i></p>

<hr>

<p>There are many 
articles which have pointed out the distortions, falsehoods, and lies in the 
film <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i>. This report compiles the <i>Fahrenheit 9/11 </i>
deceits which have been identified by a wide variety of reviewers. In addition, 
I identify some inaccuracies which have not been addressed by other writers.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The report follows 
the approximate order in which the movie covers particular topics: the Bush 
family, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. This report focuses solely on 
factual issues, and not on aesthetic criticism of the film.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To understand the 
deceptions, it helps to understand Moore�s ideological position. So let us start 
with Moore�s belief that the September 11 attacks on the United States were 
insignificant.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Edward Koch, the 
former Democratic Mayor of New York City, writes:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  
A year after 9/11, I was part of a panel discussion 
on BBC-TV�s &quot;Question Time&quot; show which aired live in the United Kingdom. A 
portion of my commentary at that time follows: </p>
<p>&quot;One of the 
panelists was Michael Moore�During the warm-up before the studio audience, 
Moore said something along the lines of &quot;I don�t know why we are making so 
much of an act of terror. It is three times more likely that you will be 
struck by lightning than die from an act of terror.&quot;�I mention this exchange 
because it was not televised, occurring as it did before the show went live. 
It shows where he was coming from long before he produced &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edward
<a href="http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/breaking_2.html">Koch</a>, 
&quot;Moore�s propaganda film cheapens debate, polarizes nation,&quot; <i>World Tribune</i>, 
June 28, 2004.<b> </b>[Moore response: none.]</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the way, I don't disagree with the point that it is 
reasonable to consider the number of deaths from any particular problem, 
including terrorism, in 
assessing how serious the problem is. Moore's point, however, was willfully 
oblivious to the fact that <i>al Qaeda </i>did not intend 9/11 to be the last 
word; the organization was working on additional attacks, and if the 
organization obtained the right weapons, millions of people might be killed. 
More fundamentally, even if Moore's argument in London is conceded to be 
legitimate, it contradicts <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i>'s presentation of Moore as 
intensely concerned about the September 11 attacks.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we go through 
the long list of lies and tricks in<i> Fahrenheit 9/11</i>, keep in mind that 
Michael Moore has assembled a &quot;war room&quot; of political operatives and lawyers in 
order to respond to criticism of <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> and to file defamation 
suits. (Jack <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2102725/">Shafer</a>, &quot;Libel Suit 
9/11. Michael Moore�s hysterical, empty threats,&quot; <i>Slate.com</i>, June 12, 
2004.) One of Moore's &quot;war room&quot; officials is Chris Lehane; Lehane, as 
an employee of Democratic presidential candidate Wesley Clark (who was also 
supported by Moore), is alleged to have
<a href="http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/001426.html">spread rumors to the 
press</a> about John Kerry's alleged extra-marital affair, although Lehane 
denies doing so.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course if there are any genuine errors in this 
report, the errors will be promptly corrected. On July 5, I removed a complaint 
about a Presidential approval poll number, which I had wrongly thought was not 
supported by data.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this report, I 
number Moore�s deceits. Some of them are outright lies; some are omissions which 
create a false impression. Others involve different forms of deception. A few 
are false statements Moore has made when defending the film. Judge for yourself 
the credibility of Michael Moore's
<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2004-07-04">
promise</a>, &quot;</font>Every single fact I state in 'Fahrenheit 9/11' is the 
absolute and irrefutable truth...Do not let anyone say this or that isn't true. 
If they say that, they are lying.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>

Night</a></b></font></p>
<p><b>Deceits 1-2</b></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>
Fahrenheit 9/11</i> 
begins on election night 2000. We are first shown Al Gore rocking on stage 
with famous musicians and a high-spirited crowd. The conspicuous sign on stage 
reads &quot;Florida Victory.&quot; Moore creates the impression that Gore was celebrating 
his victory in Florida. Moore's voiceover claims, &quot;And little Stevie Wonder, he 
seemed so happy, like a miracle had taken place.&quot; The verb tense of past perfect 
(&quot;had taken&quot;) furthers the impression that the election has been completed.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Actually, the rally 
took place in the early hours of election day, before polls had even opened. 
Gore did campaign in Florida on election day, but went home to Tennessee to 
await the results. The &quot;Florida Victory&quot; sign reflected Gore�s hopes, not any 
actual election results. (&quot;<a href="http://www.evote.com/News/EV11072000E.html">Gore 
Campaigns Into Election Da</a>y,&quot; Associated Press, Nov. 7, 2000.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The film shows CBS 
and CNN calling Florida for Al Gore. According to the narrator, &quot;Then something 
called the Fox News Channel called the election in favor of the other guy�.All 
of a sudden the other networks said, 'Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true.'&quot;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We then see NBC 
anchor Tom Brokaw stating, &quot;All of us networks made a mistake and projected 
Florida in the Al Gore column. It was our mistake.&quot;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore thus creates 
the false impression that the networks withdrew their claim about Gore winning 
Florida when they heard that Fox said that Bush won Florida. </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In fact, the 
networks which called Florida for Gore did so early in the evening�before polls 
had even closed in the Florida panhandle, which is part of the Central Time 
Zone. NBC called Florida 
for Gore at 7:49:40 p.m., Eastern 
Time. This was 10 minutes before polls closed in the Florida panhandle. Thirty 
seconds later, CBS called Florida for Gore. And at 7:52
p.m., <i>Fox</i> called Florida 
for Gore. Moore never lets the audience know that Fox was among the networks 
which made the error of calling Florida for Gore prematurely. Then at 8:02
p.m., ABC called Florida for 
Gore. Only ABC had waited until the Florida polls were closed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>About an 
hour before the polls closed in panhandle Florida, the networks called the U.S. 
Senate race in favor of the Democratic candidate. The networks seriously 
compounded the problem because from 6-7 Central Time, they
<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/lott200312100915.asp">repeatedly 
announced</a> that polls had closed in Florida--even though polls were open in 
the panhandle. (See also Joan
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/02/02/cnn.report/cnn.pdf">
Konner</a>, James Risser &amp; Ben Wattenberg, <i>Television's Performance on 
Election Night 2000: A Report for CNN</i>, Jan. 29, 2001.)</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 
false announcements that the polls were closed, as well as the premature calls 
(the Presidential race ten minutes early; the Senate race an hour early), may have cost Bush thousands of votes from the conservative panhandle, as 
discouraged last-minute voters heard that their state had already been decided; 
some last-minute voters on their way to the polling place turned around and went 
home. Other voters who were waiting in line left the polling place. In Florida, as 
elsewhere, voters who have arrived at the polling place before closing time 
often end up voting after closing time, because of long lines. The conventional 
wisdom of politics is that supporters of the losing candidate are most likely to 
give up on voting when they hear that their side has already lost. Thus, on 
election night 1980, when incumbent President Jimmy Carter gave a concession 
speech while polls were still open on the west coast, the early concession was blamed for costing the Democrats several Congressional seats in the West, 
such as that of 20-year incumbent
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/polibig/eastbusi.htm">James Corman</a>. 
The fact that all the networks had declared Reagan a landslide winner while west 
coast voting was still in progress was also blamed for Democratic losses in the 
West; Congress even held hearings about prohibiting the disclosure of exit polls 
before voting had ended in the any of the 48 contiguous states. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if the premature television calls affected all potential voters 
equally, the effect was to reduce Republican votes significantly, because the 
Florida panhandle is a Republican stronghold. Most of Central Time Zone Florida 
is in the 1st Congressional District, which is known as the &quot;Redneck Riviera.&quot; 
In that district, Bob Dole beat Bill Clinton by 69,000 votes in 1996, even though 
Clinton won the state by 300,000 votes. So depress overall turnout in the 
panhandle, and you will necessarily depress more Republican than Democratic 
votes. A <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=276278">
2001 study</a> by John Lott suggested that the early calls cost Bush at least 
7,500 votes, and perhaps many more.
<a href="http://www.senate.gov/~gov_affairs/050301_Perrin.htm">Another study</a>

<p>At 10:00 p.m., 
which networks took the lead in retracting the premature Florida win for Gore? 
They were CNN and CBS, <i>not</i> Fox. (The two networks 
were using a shared Decision Team.) See Linda Mason, Kathleen Francovic &amp;

News Coverage of Election Night 2000</a>: Investigation, Analysis, 
Recommendations&quot; (CBS News, Jan. 2001), pp. 12-25.) </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In fact, Fox
<a href="http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/27166.htm">did not 
retract</a> its claim that 
Gore had won Florida until 2 a.m.--four hours after other networks had withdrawn 
the call.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over four hours 
later, at 2:16 a.m., Fox 
projected Bush as the Florida winner, as did all the other networks by 2:20
a.m.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At 3:59 a.m., 
CBS took the lead in retracting the Florida call for Bush. All the other 
networks, including Fox, followed the CBS lead within eight minutes. That the 
networks arrived at similar conclusions within a short period of time is not 
surprising, since they were all using the same data from the Voter News Service. 
(<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/c2k/pdf/REPFINAL.pdf">Mason, et al.</a> 
&quot;CBS News Coverage.&quot;) As the CBS timeline details, 
throughout the evening all networks used VNS data to call states, 
even though VNS had not called the state; sometimes the network calls were made 
hours ahead of the VNS call.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore�s editing 
technique of the election night segment is typical of his style: all the video 
clips are real clips, and nothing he says is, narrowly speaking, false. But 
notice how he says, &quot;Then something called the Fox News Channel called the 
election in favor of the other guy�&quot; The impression created is that the Fox call 
of Florida for Bush came soon after the CBS/CNN calls of Florida for Gore, and 
that Fox caused the other networks to change (&quot;All of a sudden the other 
networks said, 'Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true.'&quot;)</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the essence 
of the Moore technique: cleverly blending half-truths to deceive the viewer.</font></p>

Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris (who was Bush's Florida co-chair,

<p> </p>
<p>A little while 
later, <i>Fahrenheit </i>shows Jeffrey Toobin (a 
sometime talking head lawyer for CNN) claiming that if the Supreme Court had 
allowed a third recount to proceed past the legal deadline, &quot;under every scenario Gore won the election.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Fahrenheit </i>shows only a snippet of Toobin's remarks on CNN. What <i>
Fahrenheit</i> does not show is that
<a href="http://secure.mediaresearch.org/news/cyberalert/2001/cyb200111132.html">
Toobin admitted</a> on CNN that the only scenarios for a Gore victory involved a 
type of recount which Gore had never requested in his lawsuits, and which would 
have been in violation of Florida law. Toobin's theory likewise depends on 
re-assigning votes which are plainly marked for one candidate (Pat Buchanan) to 
Gore, although there are no provisions in Florida law to guess at who a voter 
&quot;really&quot; meant to vote for and to re-assign the vote.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
A study by a newspaper consortium including the 
<i>Miami Herald</i> and <i>USA Today </i>
disproves <i>Fahrenheit</i>'s claim that 
Gore won under any scenario. As <i>
USA Today </i>
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-05-10-recountmain.htm">summarized</a>, 
on May 11, 2001:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Who would have won if Al Gore had gotten manual counts he requested in 
four counties? Answer: George W. Bush.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who would have won if the U.S. Supreme Court had not stopped the hand 
recount of undervotes, which are ballots that registered no machine-readable 
vote for president? Answer: Bush, under three of four standards.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Who would have won if all disputed ballots � including those rejected by 
machines because they had more than one vote for president � had been 
recounted by hand? Answer: Bush, under the two most widely used standards; 
Gore, under the two least used.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the Florida election controversy, the 
focus was on &quot;undervotes&quot;--ballots which were disqualified because the voter had 
not properly indicated a candidate, such as by punching out a small piece of 
paper on the paper ballot. The recounts attempted to discern voter intentions 
from improperly-marked ballots. Thus, if a ballot had a &quot;hanging chad,&quot; a 
recount official might decide that the voter intended to vote for the candidate, 
but failed to properly punch out the chad; so the recounter would award the 
candidate a vote from the &quot;spoiled&quot; ballot. Gore was seeking additional recounts<i> 
only</i> of undervotes. The only scenario by which Gore would have won Florida 
would have involved recounts of &quot;overvotes&quot;--ballots which were spoiled because 
the voter voted for more than one candidate (such as by marking two names, or by 
punching out two chads). Most of the overvotes which were recoverable were those 
on which the voter had punched out a chad (or made a check mark) and had also 
written the candidate's name on the write-in line. Gore's lawsuits never sought a recount of overvotes, so even if 
the Supreme Court had allowed a Florida recount to continue past the legal 
deadline, Bush still would have won the additional recount which Gore sought. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A 
separate study conducted by a newspaper consortium including the <i>New York 
Times</i> and <i>Wall Street Journal</i> found that if there had been a 
statewide recount of all undervotes and overvotes, Gore would have won under 
seven different standards. However, if there had been partial recounts under any 
of the various recounts sought by Gore or ordered by the Florida Supreme Court, 
Bush would have won under every scenario.</font></p>
<p>A very interesting
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/images/2001/11/12/politics/recount/">web widget</a> 
published by the <i>New York Times</i> allows readers to crunch the data any way 
they want: what standards for counting ballots, whose counting system to apply, 
and how to treat overvotes. It's certainly possible under some of the variable 
scenarios to produce a Gore victory. But it's undeniably dishonest for <i>
Fahrenheit </i>to assert that Gore would win under any scenario. </p>
<p>Moore amplifies the deceit with a montage of newspaper headlines, purporting 
to show that Gore really won.
<a href="http://tvh.rjwest.com/archives/005307.html">One article</a> shows a 
date of December 19, 2001, with a large headline reading, &quot;Latest Florida

Pantagraph</i>, a daily newspaper in Bloomington, Illinois. But actually, the 
headline is merely for a letter to the editor--not a news article. The letter to 
the editor headline is significantly enlarged to make it look like an article 
headline. The <a href="http://moorewatch.com/index.php/C18/">actual printed

<p><i>The Pantagraph's </i>attorney sent<i> Fahrenheit's</i> distributor<i>

<a name="Florida_Purge_of_Convicted_Felons_from_Voter_Rolls">Florida Purge of 
Convicted Felons from Voter Rolls</a></b></font></p>
<p><b>Deceit 4</b></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to <i>
Fahrenheit</i>, Bush cronies hired Data Base Technologies to purge Florida 
voters who might vote for Gore, and these potential voters were purged from the 
voting rolls on the basis of race. (&quot;Second, make sure the chairman of your 
campaign is also the vote count woman. And that her state has hired a company 
that's gonna knock voters off the rolls who aren't likely to vote for you. You 
can usually tell 'em by the color of their skin.&quot;) As explained by the <i>
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0527-03.htm">Palm Beach Post</a></i>, 
Moore's suggestion is extremely incomplete, and on at least one fact, plainly false.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 1998 mayoral 
election in Miami was a fiasco which was declared void by Florida courts, 
because--in violation of Florida law--convicted felons had been allowed to vote. 
The Florida legislature ordered the executive branch to purge felons from the 
voting rolls before the next election. Following instructions from Florida 
officials, Data Base Technologies (DBT) aggressively attempted to identify all 
convicted felons who were illegally registered to vote in Florida.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were two 
major problems with the purge. First, several states allow felons to vote once 
they have completed their sentences. Some of these ex-felons moved to Florida 
and were, according to a court decision, eligible to vote. Florida improperly 
purged these immigrant felons. </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Second, the 
comprehensive effort to identify all convicted felons led to a large number of 
false positives, in which persons with, for example, the same name as a 
convicted felon, were improperly purged. Purged voters were, in most cases, 
notified months before the election and given an opportunity to appeal, but the 
necessity to file an appeal was in itself a barrier which probably discouraged 
some legitimate, non-felon citizens from voting. According to the <i>Palm Beach 
Post</i>, at least 1,100 people were improperly purged. </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The overbreadth of 
the purge was well-known in Florida before the election. As a result, election 
officials in 20 of Florida's counties ignored the purge list entirely. In these 
counties, convicted felons were allowed to vote. Also according to the <i>Post</i>, 
thousands of felons were improperly allowed to vote in the 20 non-purging 
counties. <a href="http://www.manhattan-institute.org/final_dissent.pdf">
Analysis</a> by Abigail Thernstrom and Russell G. Redenbaugh, dissenting from a 
report by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, suggests that about 5,600 felons 
voted illegally in Florida. (The Thernstrom/Redenbaugh dissent explains why 
little credit should be given to the majority report, which was produced by 
flagrantly ignoring data.)</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When allowed to 
vote, felons vote approximately 69 percent Democratic, according to a study in 
the <i><a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/community/article708.html">American 
Sociological Review</a></i>. Therefore, if the thousands of felons in the 
non-purging 20 counties had not been illegally allowed to vote, it is 
likely that Bush's statewide margin would have been substantially larger. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regardless, Moore's 
suggestion that the purge was conducted on the basis of race was indisputably false. 
As the<i> <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0527-03.htm">Palm Beach Post</a></i> details, all the evidence shows that Data Base 
Technologies did not use race as a basis for the purge. Indeed, DBT's refusal to 
take note of a registered voter's race was one of the reasons for the many cases 
of mistaken identity.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>DBT's computers had matched these people with felons, 
though in dozens of cases they did not share the same name, birthdate, gender or 
race...[A] review of state records, internal e-mails of DBT employees and 
testimony before the civil rights commission and an elections task force showed 
no evidence that minorities were specifically targeted. Records show that DBT 
told the state it would not use race as a criterion to identify felons. The list 
itself bears that out: More than 1,000 voters were matched with felons though 
they were of different races.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 
appeals record supports the <i>Palm Beach Post</i>'s findings. Based on the 
numbers of successful appeals, blacks were less likely to have been improperly 
placed on the purge list: of the blacks who were purged, 5.1 percent 
successfully appealed. Of Hispanics purged, 8.7 percent successfully appealed. 
Of whites purged, 9.9 percent successfully appealed. John R. Lott, Jr.,<i> </i>&quot;<a href="http://johnrlott.tripod.com/op-eds/Lott_on_Fla_2000_Elec.pdf">Nonvoted 
Ballots and Discrimination in Florida</a>,&quot;<i> Journal of Legal Studies</i>, 
vol. 32 (Jan. 2003), p. 209. Of course it is theoretically possible that the 
appeals officials discriminated against blacks, or that improperly purged blacks 
were not as likely to appeal as were people of other races.<i> </i>But no one 
has offered any evidence to support such possibilities.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/">Moore 
response</a>: Cites various articles about the felon purge. Offers no evidence 
to support the claim that voters were targeted on the basis of race.]</font></p>

<p><b>Deceit 5</b></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The movie lauds an 
anti-Bush riot that took place in Washington, D.C., on the day of Bush�s 
inauguration. He claims that protestors &quot;pelted Bush's limo with eggs.&quot; 
Actually, it was just one egg,
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1127937.stm">according to the 
BBC</a>. According to Moore, &quot;No President had ever witnessed such a thing 
on his inauguration day. &quot; According to CNN, Richard Nixon faced comparable 
protests in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0101/21/sm.03.html">1969</a> 
and
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/20/protest.wrap/index.html">
1973</a>. According to <i>USA Today</i>, the anti-Bush organizers claimed that 
they expected 20,000 protesters to show up, whereas the anti-Nixon protest in 
1973 drew 60,000 people. (<i>USA Today</i>, Jan. 20, 2001).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore says, &quot;The plan to have Bush 
get out of the limo for the traditional walk to the White House was scrapped. 
But <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1127937.stm">according to 
the BBC</a>, &quot;Mr. Bush delighted his supporters by getting out of his limousine 
and walked the last block of the parade, holding hands with his wife Laura.&quot;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore continues: 
&quot;And for the next eight months it didn�t get any better for 
George W. Bush. He couldn�t get his judges appointed; he had trouble getting his 
legislation passed; and he lost Republican control of the Senate. His approval 
ratings in the polls began to sink.&quot;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part of this is 
true. Once Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican party, Democrats 
controlled the Senate, and stalled the confirmation of some 
of the judges whom Bush had nominated for the federal courts. </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Congress did enact 
the top item on Bush�s agenda: a large tax cut. During the summer, the 
Republican-controlled House of Representatives easily passed many of Bush�s 
other agenda items, including the bill whose numbering reflected the President�s 
top priority: H.R. 1, the Bush &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; education bill. The fate 
of the Bush bills in the Democratic-controlled Senate, as of August 2001, was 
uncertain. The Senate later did pass No Child Left Behind, but some other Bush 
proposals did not pass.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore 
says that Bush's &quot;approval ratings in the polls began to sink.&quot; This is not 
entirely accurate, although I haven't counted this issue as a &quot;deceit.&quot; From 
January 2001 to September 2001, Bush's approval ratings in almost all polls 
fluctuated pretty narrowly in a 50-59% range. Moore accurately cites a <i>
Christian Science Monitor</i> poll with 45 percent approval for Bush on 
September 5, 2001, but the low result here is an outlier compared to the overall 
poll trend. What really changed for Bush, pollwise, was not that his approval 
ratings were sinking, but that his disapproval ratings had risen. The
<a href="http://www.hist.umn.edu/~ruggles/Approval.htm">national polls</a> 
showed that the approve/disapprove gap for Bush was much larger in 
January 2001 than in the late summer of 2001. So Moore is correct that Bush's 
polls numbers had deteriorated, although Moore's phrasing is not correct.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&quot;He was already beginning to look 
like a lame duck President.&quot; Maybe in Moore's imagination. No serious political 
commentator made such a claim in 2001.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bush is 
quoted as saying, &quot;</font>A dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier, 
there's no question about it.&quot; What Moore fails to note, though, is that the 
quote, from July 26, 2001, is a
<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/32902_bush27.shtml">facetious 
joke</a>, like Moore's
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040216fa_fact7">claim</a> in <i>
Dude, Where's my Country?</i> that he did not have sex until age 32. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another Bush joke is presented as an 
obvious joke, although important context is missing. Near the end of the movie, 
Bush speaks to a tuxedoed audience. He says, &quot;I call you the haves and the 
have-mores. Some call you the elite; I call you my base.&quot; The joke follows 
several segments in which Bush is accused of having started the Iraq war in 
order to enrich business. As far the movie audience can tell, Bush is speaking 
to some unknown group of rich people. The speech actually comes from the October 
19, 2000, Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The 2000 event was the 
55th annual dinner, which raises money for Catholic hospital charities in New 
York City. Candidates Bush and Gore were the co-guests of honor at the event, 
where speakers traditionally make fun of themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gore joked, &quot;The Al Smith Dinner 
represents a hallowed and important tradition, which I actually did invent.&quot; 
Lampooning his promise to put Social Security in a &quot;lock box,&quot; Gore promised 
that he would put &quot;Medicare in a walk-in closet,&quot; put NASA funding in a 
&quot;hermetically sealed Ziploc bag&quot; and would &quot;always keep lettuce in the crisper.&quot;

&quot;Presidential hopefuls Gore and Bush mix humor and politics at Al Smith Dinner,&quot;

the joke as epitomizing Bush's selfishness, the joke really was part of Bush 
helping to raise $1.6 million for medical care for the poor. Although many a 
truth is said in jest, Bush's joke was no more revealing than was Gore's claim 
to have founded the dinner in 1946, two years before he was born. (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/18/politics/main242210.shtml">CBS

<p> </p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/">Moore

Congress on Arctic drilling, campaign finance, and faith-based charity. Cites a 
California poll in which Bush's disapproval rating equaled his approval rating. 
Cites a couple of additional polls, selecting Bush's worst results. No response on 
the distortion of the Alfred E. Smith Dinner. Although Moore claims that his 
website provides line-by-line citations for the movie, there is no citation for 
the quote from the Al Smith Dinner, even though it would be easy to cite 
newspapers which reported the dinner. Apparently Moore fails to provide 
citations because any citation would show that Bush was speaking at a charity

Officials arrived from Washington at 10:00 AM. Shortly thereafter, at a press 
conference, Bush announced that General Richard B. Myers will be the Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs and General Pete Pac will serve as Vice Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs. He also announced 14 other appointments, and his intentions for 
the budget. At 11:30 AM these officials, as well as National Security Council 
experts, the Secretary of Defense, and others, met with Bush to continue the 
strategic review process for military transformation (previous meetings 
have been held at the Pentagon and the White House). The meeting ended at 
5:15. <br>
Met with Andy Card and Karen Hughes, talking about communications issues.<br>
Issued a proclamation honoring Women's Equality Day.<br>
<br>
Saturday, August 25<br>
Awoke at 5:45 AM, read daily briefs.<br>
Had an hour-long CIA and national security briefing at 7:45<br>
Gave his weekly radio address on the topic of The Budget.</font></p>

<p>Having 
shown a clip from August 25 with Bush explaining how he likes to work on the 
ranch, Moore announces &quot;George Bush spent the rest of the August at the ranch.&quot; 
Not so, as</font> Scott Marquardt found by looking 
at Bush's activity for the very next day.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sunday, August 26<br>
Speaks at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.<br>
Speaks at the U.S. Steel Group Steelworkers Picnic at Mon Valley Works, 
southeast of Pittsburgh. He also visits some employees still working, not at 
the picnic. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marquandt looked up Bush's activities for 
the next three days:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Declared a major disaster area in Ohio and orders federal aid. This affects 
Brown, Butler, Clermont and Hamilton counties.<br>
Sent a report on progress toward a &quot;solution of the Cyprus question&quot; to the 
Speaker of the House and the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations. <br>
Announced his intention to nominate Kathleen Burton Clarke to be Director of 
the Bureau of Land Management (Department of the Interior). <br>
Spoke at the American Legion's 83rd annual convention in San Antonio, 
discussing defense priorities. Decommissioned the Air Force One jet that flew 
444 missions, from the Nixon administration to Bush's retirement ceremony for the plane in Waco, Texas. <br>
Attended the dedication ceremony of the San Antonio Missions National 
Historical Park in San Antonio.<br>
Announced appointment of 13 members of the Presidential Task Force to Improve 
Health Care Delivery for Our Nations Veterans.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is 
true in a sense that the Presidency is a &quot;24/7&quot; job. But this does not mean that 
the President should be working every minute. A literal &quot;24/7&quot; job would mean 
that the President should be criticized for &quot;sleeping on the job 33 percent of 
the time&quot; if he slept for eight hours a day.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Christopher Hitchens notes:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he shot of him 
&quot;relaxing at Camp David&quot; shows him side by side with Tony Blair. I say &quot;shows,&quot; even though this photograph is on-screen so briefly that if you 
sneeze or blink, you won�t recognize the other figure. A meeting with the 
prime minister of the United Kingdom, or at least with this prime minister, is 
not a goof-off.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The president is 
also captured in a well-worn TV news clip, on a golf course, making a 
boilerplate response to a question on terrorism and then asking the reporters 
to watch his drive. Well, that�s what you get if you catch the president on a 
golf course.</font></p>

<p>
Interestingly, as detailed in Bill Clinton's 
autobiography <i>My Life</i>, in November 1995. when President 
Clinton learned that Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin had been shot, Clinton 
went out to the White House lawn and
<a href="http://www.jewishsiliconvalley.org/clinton.html">hit golf ball</a>s 
while he waited to learn if Rabin would live. That Clinton played golf after 
learning of a terrible crime in Israel obviously does not mean that he did not 
care about the crime. If a television station had recorded some footage of 
Clinton hitting golf balls that awful night, it would have easy for a 
hyper-partisan film-maker to use the footage against Clinton unfairly.</font></p>

<p>Moore wraps up the vacation segment: 
&quot;It was a summer to remember. And when it was over, he left Texas for his second

Washington,

he gave a speech</a> on August 31.</p>

<p>
<b>Moore's changing positions</b></p>
<p>
</font></p>
<p>
<i>Fahrenheit</i> 
presents a powerful segment on the September 11 attacks. There is no narration, 
and the music is dramatic yet tasteful. The visuals are reaction shots from pedestrians, 
as they gasp with horrified astonishment. </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Moore has been 
criticized for using the reaction shots as a clever way to avoid showing the 
planes hitting the buildings, and some of the victims falling to their deaths. 
Even if this is true, the segment still effectively 
evokes the horror and outrage that every decent human being still feels about September 11.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But as New York�s former Mayor Edward Koch 
reported, Moore says, &quot;I don't know why we are making so much of an act of 
terror. It is three times more likely that you will be struck by lightning than 
die from an act of terror.&quot; If there is some additional context which would 
explain Moore's remarks, he has not supplied such context on his website. It 
seems unlikely that Moore's &quot;war room&quot; is unaware of the highly critical review 
written by former NYC Mayor Koch. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore's 
first public comment about the September 11 attacks was to complain that too 
many Democrats rather than Republicans had been killed: &quot;</font>If someone did this to get back at Bush, then they did so by 
killing thousands of people who did not vote for him! Boston, New York, DC, and 
the planes' destination of California--these were places that voted against 
Bush!&quot; (The quote was originally posted as a &quot;Mike's Message&quot; on Moore's website 
on September 12, but was removed not long after. Among the many places where 
Moore's quote has been repeated is <i>
<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FQP/is_4664_132/ai_111357919">
The New Statesman</a></i>, a leftist British political magazine.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A person might feel great personal sympathy for the victim of a 
lightning strike, but the same person might feel that, overall, the &quot;lightning 
problem&quot; is not worth making a big fuss over. <i>Fahrenheit </i>presents 
September 11 as a terrible tragedy (in which Moore lost one a professional 
colleague, and 
many other people lost loved ones), and as something worth making a big fuss. On 
this latter point, <i>Fahrenheit</i>'s purported view does not appear to be the 
same as Moore's actual view.</font></p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>Fahrenheit </i>
mocks President Bush for continuing to read the book<i> My Pet Goat</i> to a classroom of elementary 
school children after he was told about the September 11 attacks.</font> 
Actually, as reported in<i>
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/?040726ta_talk_radosh">The New 
Yorker</a></i>, the book was <i>Reading Mastery 2</i>, which 
contains an exercise called &quot;The Pet Goat.&quot; The title of the book is not very 
important in itself, but the invented title of<i> My Pet Goat</i> makes it 
easier to ridicule Bush.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What Moore did not 
tell you: </font> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gwendolyn 
Tose�-Rigell, the principal of Emma E. Booker Elementary School, praised 
Bush�s action: &quot;I don�t think anyone could have handled it better.&quot; &quot;What 
would it have served if he had jumped out of his chair and ran out of the 
room?&quot;�</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>She said the 
video doesn�t convey all that was going on in the classroom, but Bush�s 
presence had a calming effect and &quot;helped us get through a very difficult 
day.&quot;</font></p>

principal defends Bush from �Fahrenheit 9/11� portrayal</a>,&quot; Associated Press, 
June 24, 2004. Also, since the President knew he was on camera, it was 
reasonable to expect that if he had suddenly sped out of the room, his hasty 
movement would have been replayed incessantly on television; leaving the room 
quickly might have exacerbated the national mood of panic, even if Bush had 
excused himself calmly.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore 
does not offer any suggestion about what the President should have done during 
those seven minutes, rather than staying calm for the sake of the classroom and 
of the public. Nor does Moore point to any way that the September 11 events 
might have turned out better in even the slightest way if the President had 
acted differently. I agree with
</font>Lee Hamilton, the Vice-Chair of the September11 Commission and a 
former Democratic Representative from Indiana: &quot;Bush made the right decision in 
remaining calm, in not rushing out of the classroom.&quot;
</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Moreover, as detailed by the <i>

holding up a legal pad with the words, &quot;DON'T SAY ANYTHING YET.&quot; The Secret 
Service may well have been cautious about moving Bush, not only because of 
hijackings, but also because
<a href="http://www.longboatobserver.com/showarticle.asp?ai=1874">on the morning

<blockquote>
<p>Deputy Secretary 
of Defense Paul Wolfowitz is shown surreptitiously licking his comb in 
preparation for Congressional testimony under the cameras. I know: Eeeuuww! 
Moore's point is that this proves Wolfowitz is a low life, a sleazy guy whose 
policy opinions should be devalued accordingly. And, of course, it's funny to 
see the famous and powerful embarrass themselves. Yet not one among us hasn't 
had dozens of questionable hygiene moments that we would be mortified to have 
witnessed by anyone, not to mention see featured in a nationally released 
documentary. Moore knows that Wolfowitz's desperate act in attempting to tame 
unruly hair for a public appearance will look much worse on movie screen than 
it really is, and he must know that periodic hygiene failings are not any kind 
of proof of depravity: after all, we're talking about a director here who 
habitually appears in public unshaven and sloppily dressed. To Moore's likely 
retort that Wolfowitz deserves to be gratuitously ridiculed for doing nothing 
worse than any member of his audience could easily recall doing himself, the 
answer is that nobody deserves to be treated this way. It is cruel and 
hypocritical, and violates basic ethical reciprocity. Doing so is wrong, and 
far more wrong, and infinitely more harmful to others, than licking one's own 
comb.</p>

<p></font></p>
<p>Castigating the 
allegedly lazy President, Moore says, &quot;Or perhaps he just should have read the 
security briefing that was given to him on August 6, 2001 that said that Osama 
bin Laden was planning to attack America by hijacking airplanes.&quot; </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore supplies no 
evidence for his assertion that President Bush did not read the August 6, 2001 
Presidential Daily Brief. Moore�s assertion appears to be a complete 
fabrication.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore smirks that 
perhaps President Bush did not read the Briefing because its title was so vague. 
Moore then cuts to Condoleezza Rice announcing the title of the Briefing: &quot;Bin 
Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.&quot; Here, Moore seems to be playing off 
Condoleezza Rice's testimony of the September 11 Commission that the <i>contents</i> 
of the memo were vague.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, no-one 
(except Moore) has ever claimed that Bush did not read the Briefing, or that he 
did not read it because the title was vague. Rather, Condoleezza Rice had told 
the press conference that the information in the Briefing was &quot;very vague.&quot; <i>

<p> </p>
<p>The content of the 
Briefing supports Rice�s characterization, and refutes Moore�s assertion that 
the Briefing &quot;said that Osama bin Laden was planning to attack America by 
hijacking airplanes.&quot; The actual
<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/pdb8-6-2001.pdf">Briefing</a> was 
highly equivocal:</font></p>
<blockquote>

We have not been able to corroborate some of the

in 1998 saying that Bin Laden wanted to hijack a U.S. aircraft to gain the 
release of &quot;Blind Shaykh&quot; �Umar� Abd aI-Rahman and other U.S.-held extremists.
</p>
<p>
  
Nevertheless, FBI information since that time 
indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with 
preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent 
surveillance of federal buildings in New York. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Some readers have 
wondered how this short segment qualifies as three deceits: 1. that Bush did not 
read the memo, 2. that the memo's title was offered as an excuse for not reading 
the memo, 3. omitting that the memo was equivocal, and that the hijacking 
warning was something that the FBI said it was &quot;unable to corroborate.&quot;)</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moore is guilty 
of a classic game of saying one thing and implying another when he describes 
how members of the Saudi elite were flown out of the United States shortly 
after 9/11. </font> </p>
<p> If you listen only to what Moore says during this segment of the movie�and 
take careful notes in the dark�you�ll find he�s got his facts right. He and 
others in the film state that 142 Saudis, including 24 members of the bin 
Laden family, were allowed to leave the country after Sept. 13. </font> </p>
<p> The date�Sept. 13�is crucial because that is when a national ban on air 
traffic, for security purposes, was eased </font> </p>
<p> But nonetheless, many viewers will leave the movie theater with the impression 
that the Saudis, thanks to special treatment from the White House, were 
permitted to fly away when all other planes were still grounded. This false 
impression is created by Moore�s failure, when mentioning Sept. 13, to 
emphasize that the ban on flights had been eased by then. The false impression 
is further pushed when Moore shows the singer Ricky Martin walking around an 
airport and says, &quot;Not even Ricky Martin would fly. But really, who wanted to 
fly? No one. Except the bin Ladens.&quot;</font></p>
<p> But the movie fails to mention that the FBI interviewed about 30 of the Saudis 
before they left. And the independent 9/11 commission has reported that &quot;each 
of the flights we have studied was investigated by the FBI and dealt with in a 
professional manner prior to its departure.&quot;</font></p>

were allowed, and the airlines were allowed to move their planes to new airports

immediately after 9/11. What the film does not mention is that

Associated Press interview</a>, Clarke said that he agreed with much of what 
Moore had to say, but that the Saudi flight material was a mistake. Clarke 
testified to the September 11 Commission, on September 3, 2003, that letting the 
Saudis go </font>&quot;was a conscious decision with complete review at the highest 
levels of the State Department and the FBI and the White House.&quot; It's possible 
to read Clarke's 2003 statement as consistent with his 2004 statements; if you 
believe that what Clarke is saying now contradicts what he said in 2003, then 
Clarke is a liar, and all other claims he makes in <i>Fahrenheit </i>are 
discredited. Although he really did not make those claims for <i>Fahrenheit</i>; 
according to <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110005402">

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I

<p><i>

</i>article headlined &quot;White House Approved Departures of Saudis after Sept. 11, 
Ex-Aide Says.&quot; The camera pans over the article far too quickly for any ordinary 
viewer to spot and read the words in which Clarke states that he approved the 
flights.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like 
Clarke, most of the political figures in <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> were not filmed 
by Moore; he used footage which had been shot by news organizations. The Internet 
Movie Database lists 40 public figures in the &quot;cast&quot; of <i>Fahrenheit</i>; of 
these, 37 are listed as from &quot;archival footage.&quot;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some Saudis left 
the U.S. by charter flight on September 14, a day when commercial flights had 
resumed, but when ordinary charter planes were still grounded. When did the bin 
Ladens actually leave? Not until the next week, as the the 9/11 Commission staff
<a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing10/staff_statement_10.pdf">
report</a> explains: </font> </p>
<blockquote>
<p> Fearing 
reprisals against Saudi nationals, the Saudi government asked for help in 
getting some of its citizens out of the country�.we have found that the 
request came to the attention of Richard Clarke and that each of the flights 
we have studied was investigated by the FBI and dealt with in a professional 
manner prior to its departure.</font></p>
<p>   No 
commercial planes, including chartered flights, were permitted to fly into, 
out of, or within the United States until September 13, 2001. After the 
airspace reopened, six chartered flights with 142 people, mostly Saudi Arabian 
nationals, departed from the United States between September 14 and 24. One 
flight, the so-called Bin Ladin flight, departed the United States on 
September 20 with 26 passengers, most of them relatives of Usama Bin Ladin. We 
have found no credible evidence that any chartered flights of Saudi Arabian 
nationals departed the United States before the reopening of national 
airspace.</font></p>
<p>   The 
Saudi flights were screened by law enforcement officials, primarily the FBI, 
to ensure that people on these flights did not pose a threat to national 
security, and that nobody of interest to the FBI with regard to the 9/11 
investigation was allowed to leave the country. Thirty of the 142 people on 
these flights were interviewed by the FBI, including 22 of the 26 people (23 
passengers and 3 private security guards) on the Bin Ladin flight. Many were 
asked detailed questions. None of the passengers stated that they had any 
recent contact with Usama Bin Ladin or knew anything about terrorist activity.</font></p>
<p>   The 
FBI checked a variety of databases for information on the Bin Ladin flight 
passengers and searched the aircraft. It is unclear whether the TIPOFF 
terrorist watchlist was checked. At our request, the Terrorist Screening 
Center has rechecked the names of individuals on the flight manifests of these 
six Saudi flights against the current TIPOFF watchlist. There are no matches.</font></p>
<p>   The 
FBI has concluded that nobody was allowed to depart on these six flights who 
the FBI wanted to interview in connection with the 9/11 attacks, or who the 
FBI later concluded had any involvement in those attacks. To date, we have 
uncovered no evidence to contradict this conclusion.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final Commission Report
<a href="http://tvh.rjwest.com/archives/005360.html">confirms</a> that Clarke 
was the highest-ranking official who made the decision to let the Saudis go, and 
that Clarke's decision had no adverse effect on September 11 investigations. See 
pages 328-29 of the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf">
Report</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Moore's line, &quot;But really, who wanted 
to fly? No one. Except the bin Ladens,&quot; happens to be a personal lie.

<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacysummary.pdf">federal law</a> (the Health

National Guard to black out the names any Guardsmen whose

released regarding George Bush's health records. In Bath's case, he had been 
suspended for failing to take an annual physical exam. So what Moore presents as a

legally-required compliance with federal law.</font></p>

<p>Moore�s film 
suggests that Bush has close family ties to the bin Laden family�principally 
through Bush�s father�s relationship with the Carlyle Group, a private 
investment firm. The president�s father, George H.W. Bush, was a senior 
adviser to the Carlyle Group�s Asian affiliate until recently; members of the 
bin Laden family�who own one of Saudi Arabia�s biggest construction firms�had 
invested $2 million in a Carlyle Group fund. Bush Sr. and the bin Ladens have 
since severed ties with the Carlyle Group, which in any case has a bipartisan 
roster of partners, including Bill Clinton�s former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt. 
The movie quotes author Dan Briody claiming that the Carlyle Group &quot;gained&quot; 
from September 11 because it owned United Defense, a military contractor. 
Carlyle Group spokesman Chris Ullman notes that United Defense holds a special 
distinction among U.S. defense contractors that is not mentioned in Moore�s 
movie: the firm�s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for 
the U.S. Army is one of the only weapons systems canceled by the Bush 
administration.</font></p>

that when Carlyle took United Defense public, they made a one-day profit of

<p>Moore alleges that

<blockquote>
<p>Moore derives the 
$1.4 billion figure from journalist Craig Unger�s book, &quot;House of Bush, House

source: contracts in the early to mid-1990�s that the Saudi Arabian government 
awarded to a U.S. defense contractor, BDM, for training the country�s military 
and National Guard. What�s the significance of BDM? The firm at the time was 
owned by the Carlyle Group, the powerhouse private-equity firm whose 
Asian-affiliate advisory board has included the president�s father, George H.W.

<p> ...The main problem with this figure, according to Carlyle spokesman Chris

Bush served as C.I.A. Director in 1976. It would not be surprising for him to 
want to follow C.I.A. activities in retirement. Earlier in the film, however,

asks Craig Unger: &quot;How much money do the Saudis have invested in America, 
roughly?&quot;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unger replies, 
&quot;Uh, I've heard figures as high as $860 billion dollars.&quot;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is 
the basis of Unger's claim? The $860 billion figure appears on page 28 of 
Unger's <i>House of Bush, House of Saud</i>. He cites two sources: The Saudi 
Ambassador's 1996 speech to the U.S.-Saudi Arabian Business Council. In that
<a href="http://www.us-saudi-business.org/p96bandr.htm">speech</a>, Prince 
Bandar discussed the Saudi economy, but said nothing about the size of Saudi 
investment in the U.S.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unger's other cited source is a 
February 11, 2002, <i>Washington Post</i> story, titled &quot;Enormous 
Wealth Spilled Into American Coffers.&quot; The $860 billion figure does not appear 
there, either. The article states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
After nearly three decades of 
accumulating this wealth, the group referred to by bankers as &quot;high net worth
Saudi 
individuals&quot; holds between $500 billion and $1 trillion abroad, most of it in 
European and American investments. Brad Bourland, chief economist of the
Saudi 
American Bank (one-quarter owned by Citibank), said in a speech in London last 
June that his bank's best estimate of the total is about $700 billion, with 
the possibility that it is as much as $1 trillion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Raymond Seitz, vice chairman of 
Lehman Brothers in London and a former U.S. ambassador to Britain, gave a 
similar estimate. Seitz said
Saudis 
typically put about three-quarters of their money into the United States, the 
rest in Europe and Asia. That would mean that  
Saudi 
nationals have invested perhaps $500 billion to $700 billion in the American 
economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, Unger's cited sources do 
not support his $860 billion figure. He may have &quot;heard&quot; the figure of $860 
billion dollars, but only from people who were repeating the factoid which he 
invented.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
According to the Institute for Research Middle Eastern Policy (a pro-Saudi think 
tank which tries to emphasize the importance of Saudi money to the United 
States), in February 2003 <i>total</i> worldwide Saudi investment was at least $700 
billion, conservatively estimated. Sixty percent of the Saudi investments were 
in the United States, so the Saudis had at least 420 billion dollars invested in 
the U.S. (Tanya C.
<a href="http://www.saudi-american-forum.org/Newsletters/SAF_Essay_22.htm">Hsu</a> 
, &quot;The United States Must Not Neglect Saudi Arabian Investment,&quot; Sept. 23, 2003.)</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unger is 
asked &quot;w</font>hat percentage of our economy is that?&quot;
(Meaning the supposed $860 billion.)
</font></p>
<p>He replies, &quot;Well, in terms of investments on Wall Street, American equities,
it's roughly six or seven percent of America</strong>. 
They own a fairly good slice of America.&quot; A little bit later, Moore states that 
&quot;Saudi Prince Bandar is perhaps the best protected ambassador in the US...Considering 
how he and his family, and the Saudi elite own seven percent of America</strong>, 
it's probably not a bad idea.&quot;</p>
<p>According the Census Bureau, the top 
countries which own U.S. stocks and bonds are the 
United Kingdom and Japan. Foreign investors owned $1,690 billion in corporate 
bonds in 2002. The Census Bureau lists the major national holders, and then 
groups all the minor holders--including Saudi Arabia--into &quot;Other Countries.&quot; <i>
All </i>of these other countries combined (including Saudi Arabia) account for 
only 6 percent of total foreign ownership of U.S. corporate bonds. Likewise, all 
&quot;Other Countries&quot; combined account for only 7 percent of total foreign ownership 
of corporate stocks. (And of course the large majority of U.S. corporate stocks 
and bonds are owned by Americans.) Bureau of the Census, <i>Statistical Abstract 
of the United States, </i>
<a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/03statab/banking.pdf">table 1203</a>.
</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
According to the
<a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/intinvnewsrelease.htm">Bureau of 
Economic Analysis</a>, total foreign investment in the United States in 2003 
was </font>$10,515 billion dollars. This means that even if the figure that 
Unger &quot;heard&quot; about Saudis having $860 billion is correct, then the Saudis would 
only have about 8 percent of total <i>foreign </i>investment in the United 
States. Unless you believe that almost all American assets are owned by 
foreigners, then it cannot possibly be true that Saudis &quot;own 
seven percent of America</strong><strong>.</strong>&quot;</p>

and repeated the Unger figure. Does not address the fact that Unger's sources do 
not support his claim. Points out that the capitalization of the New York Stock 
Exchange composite is $12 trillion and that $860 billion amounts to 
approximately 7 percent of that. But even if the Saudis owned 7% of the stocks 
on the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE does not include all of America's 
wealth--which includes real estate, businesses which are not traded on the NYSE 
because they are privately owned, and so on. The data show that the Saudis own 
between 4% (420 billion) and 7% (700 billion) of total <i>foreign investment</i>

Department, which has been notoriously supportive of pro-U.S. Arab dictatorships 
for many decades. I would much prefer that the State Department and other 
American foreign policymakers spent less time worrying about friendly relations 
with the governments of Saudi Arabia, China, and other dictatorships, and more 
time supporting the aspirations of people who want to free themselves from 
dictatorship. But complaining about the historic pro-Saudi tilt in U.S. foreign

<p>In December 1997,

Texas. The company, Unocal, was interested in building a natural gas line

met with the delegation. </font> </p>
<p> But, as Gannett

<a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1178920/posts">Enron</a> was 
not part of the consortium which expressed interest in working with Unocal on 
the pipeline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On December 9, 
2003, the new Afghanistan government did sign a protocol with Turkmenistan and 
Pakistan to facilitate a pipeline. Indeed, any Afghani government (Taliban or otherwise) 
would rationally seek the revenue that could be gained from a pipeline. But the 
protocol merely aims to entice corporations to build a 
new pipeline; no corporation has has agreed to do so. Nor 
does the new proposed pipeline even resemble Unocal's failed proposal; the new 
pipeline would the bring oil and gas from the Caspian Sea basin, whereas Unocal's proposal 
involved deposits five hundred miles away, in eastern Turkmenistan. </font></p>

showed images of pipeline construction, but the images have nothing to do with the 
Caspian Sea pipeline, for which 
<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/afghan.html">construction has never begun</a>. Nor do they have 
anything to do with the Unocal pipeline, which never existed except on paper. </font></p>

<p>According to <i>

and Karzai.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Regarding Enron, Moore cites a 1997 speech a professor, in which the professor 
said that Enron would be interested in helping to build the Unocal pipeline. 
There is no reason to doubt the professor, but the fact is that Enron was not 
among the companies which Unocal chose to work with. There is

does not attempt to

the other falsities which are detailed in this section: that Unocal had 
abandoned the project in 1998, that the 2003 Protocol involves an entirely

<p><i>
Fahrenheit 9/11</i> 
attempts in every way possible to link Osama bin Laden to George Bush. Moore 
even claims that Bush deliberately gave bin Laden &quot;a two month head start&quot; by 
not putting sufficient forces into Afghanistan soon enough. (<a href="http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/2003/cyb20030512.asp#4">On 
HBO</a>, Moore explicitly claimed that the U.S. is protecting bin Laden in order 
to please the Saudis.) However, Moore has not always been so fierce demanding 
that the Afghanistan War be prosecuted with maximal power in order to get bin 
Laden:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In late 2002, 
almost a year after the al-Qaida assault on American society, I had an onstage 
debate with Michael Moore at the Telluride Film Festival. In the course of 
this exchange, he stated his view that Osama Bin Laden should be considered 
innocent until proven guilty. This was, he said, the American way. The 
intervention in Afghanistan, he maintained, had been at least to that extent 
unjustified. Something�I cannot guess what, since we knew as much then as we 
do now�has since apparently persuaded Moore that Osama Bin Laden is as guilty 
as hell. Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any 
other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous &quot;distraction&quot; from the 
fight against him. I believe that I understand the convenience of this late 
conversion.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>

<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723">Hitchens</a>, <i>Slate</i>. That 
Osama, if captured and tried in an American court, would be entitled to a 
presumption of innocence (in the sense that the prosecution would have to prove 
guilt) does not mean that the U.S. should be morally foreclosed from destroying 
Osama's base in Afghanistan and attempting to capture or kill Osama based on 
facts demonstrating his guilt. </font> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Three days after September 11, Moore demanded that no military action be taken 
against Afghanistan:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Declare war?&quot; War against whom? One guy in the desert whom we 
can never seem to find? Are our leaders telling us that the most powerful 
country on earth cannot dispose of one sick evil f---wad of a guy? Because if 
that is what you are telling us, then we are truly screwed. If you are unable 
to take out this lone ZZ Top wannabe, what on earth would you do for us if we 
were attacked by a nation of millions? For chrissakes, call the Israelis and 
have them do that thing they do when they want to get their man! We pay them 
enough billions each year, I am SURE they would be happy to accommodate your 
request....</font></p>
<p>But do not declare war and massacre more innocents. After bin 
Laden's previous act of terror, our last elected president went and bombed 
what he said was &quot;bin Laden's camp&quot; in Afghanistan -- but instead just killed 
civilians. </font> </p>

<p>
Are we any safer because the U.S. military 
eliminated the al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, removed a government 
which did whatever al Qaeda wanted, and killed or captured two-thirds of the al 
Qaeda leadership? <i>Fahrenheit's </i>thesis that the Afghanistan War was 
solely for the pipeline and to distract attention from Saudi Arabia is 
inconsistent with the well-known results of the war. A sincere patriot could 
have opposed the Afghanistan War for a variety of reasons, such as fear that the 
invasion might stir up even more anti-American sentiment. But the only reason 
which <i>Fahrenheit</i> offers for opposing the war is the claim that not enough 
force was used in the early stages (a criticism contrary to Moore's 2001 
opposition to the use of<i> any</i> force), and the factually indefensible claim 
that the results of the war did not help American security or harm terrorists.<i>

<p>Bravo to Moore for raising the point about 
censorship of the 28 pages. It's possible that all the censorship was necessary 
to protect confidential sources, but it's also possible that at least some of 
the censorship was unnecessary, and was the result of the White House being 
overprotective of the Saudis. As I've said before, Moore is right to call 
attention to excessive Saudi influence in the U.S.; he's just wrong with many of 
his claims about particular issues, and is ridiculous in his claim that the 
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were undertaken for the benefit of the Saudis.</p>
<p>The second part of the quoted dialogue, however, 
is deceptive. The sequencing makes it appear that Kean was rebutting Bush's

<p>Much 
worse than Moore's petty slam of Senate candidate Ashcroft is Moore's false 
charge that Attorney General Ashcroft ignored warnings about the September 
11 attacks:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]fter suggesting that Ashcroft was unconcerned about terrorism before 
September 11, Moore uses phrasing that exaggerates how widespread knowledge of 
the Al Qaeda plot was before the attacks inside the FBI and Justice 
Department:</p>
<blockquote>
[Ashcroft's] own FBI knew that summer that there were Al Qaeda members in 
the US and that Bin Laden was sending his agents to flight schools around 
the country. But Ashcroft's Justice Department turned a blind eye and a deaf 
ear.</blockquote>
<p>This implies far more prior knowledge about flight school activity than 
actually existed. As the 9/11 Commission
<a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing10/staff_statement_10.pdf">
found</a> in a staff statement (72K Adobe PDF), the so-called &quot;Phoenix memo&quot; 
from an FBI agent in Arizona suggesting a possible effort by Bin Laden to send 
agents to flight schools was not widely circulated within the FBI and did not 
reach Ashcroft's desk:</p>
<blockquote>
His memo was forwarded to one field office. Managers of the Osama Bin Laden 
unit and the Radical Fundamentalist unit at FBI headquarters were 
addressees, but did not even see the memo until after September 11. No 
managers at headquarters saw the memo before September 11. The New York 
field office took no action. It was not shared outside the FBI.</blockquote>
<p>Before Sept. 11, the Minneapolis FBI also investigated Zacarias Moussaoui, 
the so-called 20th hijacker, who was enrolled in a flight school there, but no 
Al Qaeda connections were discovered until after the attacks. Again, saying 
the FBI &quot;knew&quot; of a plot to send agents to flight schools is overstated.</p>

<p>Moore claims that Bush &quot;cut terrorism funding from the FBI.&quot; Not 
so. In 2001, the Department of Justice was operating under the budget 
established in the last year of the Clinton administration, so any proposed 
change in future budgets obviously could not have prevented September 11. For 
the 2002 budget, the Bush administration did <i>not</i> propose cutting the

was not for the FBI budget. The funding was for grants to states to buy equipment; as the 
memo detailed, the equipment fund already had more than two years worth of money 
which had not been spent, because states had not yet complied with grant 
requirements that the states produce state-wide preparedness plans in order to 
receive funding. </p>

tell, the slam on Rep. Goss is the only factual error in the segment on the 
misnamed USA PATRIOT Act. While there are a few good things in the Act, Moore's 
general critique of the Act is valid. The Act does contain many items which had 
long been on the FBI wish-list, which do not have real relation to the War on 
Terror, and which were pushed through under the pretext of 9/11.
<a href="http://www.davekopel.com/Terror/LawRev/Preventing_a_Reign_of_Terror.htm">

<b>Update </b>(April 4, 2005): Several people e-mailed me to let me know 
that the House Committee web page which provides the toll-free number only 
does so (according to web archives files, which are not comprehensive, but 
which are usually reliable) on versions of the page from June 2004 or 
later. Accordingly, it is possible that <i>Fahrenheit</i>, which finished 
production before June 2004, was accurate when it was made. I called a 
secretary at the House Committee to find out if there was additional 
information about when the toll-free number was created. I never received 
a response. Accordingly, I do not believe that clear and convincing 
evidence shows that Moore was deceptive on this matter, and I withdraw the 
charge.</font></p>

asserts that Saddam�s Iraq was a nation that &quot;had never attacked the United 
States. A nation that had never threatened to attack the United States. A nation 
that had never murdered a single American citizen.&quot; Each of these 
assertions is false.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jake Tapper (ABC

<p>Moore: That isn�t 
what I said. Quote the movie directly. </font> </p>
<p>Tapper: What is

<p>Moore: 
&quot;Murdered.&quot; The government of Iraq did not commit a premeditated murder on an 
American citizen. I�d like you to point out one. </font> </p>
<p>Tapper<b>:</b> If 
the government of Iraq permitted a terrorist named Abu Nidal who is certainly 
responsible for killing Americans to have Iraq as a safe haven; if Saddam 
Hussein funded suicide bombers in Israel who did kill Americans; if the Iraqi 
police�now this is not a murder but it�s a plan to murder�to assassinate 
President Bush which at the time merited airstrikes from President Clinton 
once that plot was discovered; does that not belie your claim that the Iraqi 
government never murdered an American or never had a hand in murdering an 
American? </font> </p>
<p>Moore: No, 
because nothing you just said is proof that the Iraqi government ever murdered 
an American citizen. And I am still waiting for you to present that proof. 
</font> </p>
<p>You�re talking 
about, they provide safe haven for Abu Nidal after the committed these 
murders, uh, Iraq helps or supports suicide bombers in Israel. I mean the 
support, you remember the telethon that the Saudis were having? It�s our 
allies, the Saudis, that have been providing help and aid to the suicide 
bombers in Israel. That�s the story you should be covering. Why don�t you 
cover that story? Why don�t you cover it? </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note Moore�s 
extremely careful phrasing of the lines which appear to exonerate Saddam, and Moore�s hyper-legal response to Tapper. In fact, Saddam provided refuge to 
notorious terrorists who had murdered Americans. Saddam provided a safe haven 
for Abu Abbas (leader of the hijacking of the ship <i>Achille Lauro </i>and the 
murder of the elderly American passenger Leon Klinghoffer), for Abu Nidal, and 
for the 1993 World Trade Center bombmaker, Abdul Rahman Yasin. By law, Saddam 
therefore was an 
accessory to the murders. Saddam order his police to murder former American 
President George Bush when he visited Kuwait City in 1993; they attempted to do so, but failed. 
In 1991, he ordered his agents to murder the American Ambassador to the 
Philippines and, separately, to murder the employees of the U.S. Information 
Service in Manila; they tried, but failed. Yet none of these aggressions 
against the United States &quot;count&quot; for Moore, because he has carefully framed his 
verbs and verb tenses to exclude them.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to Laurie 
Mylroie, a former Harvard professor who served as Bill Clinton's Iraq advisor 
during the 1992 campaign (during which Vice-Presidential candidate Gore 
repeatedly castigated incumbent President George H.W. Bush for inaction against 
Saddam), the ringleader of the World Trade Center bombings, Ramzi Yousef, was 
working for the Iraqi intelligence service. Laurie Mylroie,
<i>The War Against America: Saddam Hussein and the 
World Trade Center Attacks: A Study of Revenge</i> (N.Y.: HarperCollins, 2d rev. 
ed. 2001).</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, 
Saddam's military constantly shot at (and therefore attempted to kill) American 
and British pilots enforcing the &quot;no-fly zone&quot; over portions of Iraq. The no-fly 
zone was created to prevent Saddam's air force from being able to mass murder 
Iraqis; Saddam agreed to the no-fly zone as a condition of the ceasefire in the 
1991 Gulf War, but then refused to abide by the ceasefire conditions. (As he 
likewise refused to abide by the conditions requiring him to prove that he had 
destroyed all his weapons of mass destruction.) One could argue about whether it 
is attempted &quot;murder&quot; to break the terms of a ceasefire and to attempt to kill 
foreign soldiers who are attempting to prevent you from perpetrating mass 
murder.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But even with 
Moore�s clever phrasing designed to elide Saddam�s culpability in the murders 
and attempted murders of 
Americans, Tapper still catches him with an irrefutable point: Saddam did 
perpetrate the premeditated murder of Americans. Every victim of every 
Palestinian terrorist bomber who was funded by Saddam Hussein was the victim of 
premeditated murder�including the American victims. Because Saddam's reward 
system for the families of deceased terrorists was known and publicized, the 
reward system amounted to a before-the-fact inducement for additional terrorist 
bombings.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what does Moore 
do? He tries to change the subject. Moore makes the good point that the U.S. 
media should focus more attention on Saudi financial aid to Palestinian 
terrorists who murder Americans in Israel. On NRO, I�ve
<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/2002_04_07_corner-archive.asp#85002873">
pointed</a> to Saudi terror funding, as have other NRO writers. But pointing out 
Saudi Arabia�s guilt does not excuse Moore�s blatant lie about Saddam Hussein�s 
innocence.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/index.php?id=21">Moore

been implicated in any attack against U.S. territory and the CIA has reported no

Americans in Israel. Nor does it address the undeniable fact that Iraq was

<p> </p>
<p>Moore�s pro-Saddam 
allegation that Saddam &quot;never threatened to attack the United States&quot; is true in 
the narrow sense that Saddam never gave a speech in which he threatened to, for 
example, send the Iraqi navy and army to conduct an amphibious invasion of 
Florida. But although Saddam never threatened the territorial integrity of 
America, he repeatedly threatened Americans. For example, on November 15, 1997, the main 
propaganda organ for the Saddam regime, the newspaper <i>Babel </i>(which was 
run by Saddam Hussein's son Uday) ordered: &quot;American and British interests, 
embassies, and naval ships in the Arab region should be the targets of military 
operations and commando attacks by Arab political forces.&quot; (Stephen Hayes, <i>
The Connection: How al Qaeda's Collaboration with Saddam Hussein has Endangered 
America </i>(N.Y.: HarperCollins, 2004), p. 94.) On November 25, 2000, Saddam
<a href="http://www.meib.org/articles/0101_irbr.htm">declared</a> in a televised 
speech, &quot;</font>The Arab people have not so far fulfilled their duties. They are 
called upon to target U.S. and Zionist interests everywhere and target those who 
protect these interests.&quot; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the 
first anniversary of the September 11 attacks, a weekly newspaper owned by Uday 
Hussein said that
<a href="http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&Area=iraq&ID=SA302">
Arabs should</a> &quot;</font>use all means-and they are numerous-against the 
aggressors...and considering everything American as a military target, including 
embassies, installations, and American companies, and to create suicide/martyr [<i>fidaiyoon</i>] 
squads to attack American military and naval bases inside and outside the 
region, and mine the waterways to prevent the movement of war ships...&quot; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Moreover, the Saddam regime did not need to make 
verbal threats in order to &quot;threaten&quot; the United States. The regime 
threatened the United States by giving refuge to terrorists who had murdered 
Americans, and by funding terrorists who were killing Americans in Israel. 
Saddam gave refuge to terrorists who had attacked the United States by bombing 
the World Trade Center. In addition: </font></p>

right off the shelf. (This attempt was not uncovered until after the fall of 
Baghdad, the coalition�s presence having meanwhile put an end to the

of person who was capable of using chemical weapons, since he had actually used 
them against Iraqis who resisted his tyrannical regime. As de Villepin spoke, 
Saddam was sheltering terrorists who had murdered Americans, and was subsidizing 
the murder of Americans (and many other nationalities) in Israel. </font></p>

Moore declares that George Bush fabricated an Iraq/al Qaeda connection in order to deflect attention from his

Stephen F. Hayes's book,
<i>The Connection : How al Qaeda's Collaboration with Saddam Hussein Has 
Endangered America </i>(N.Y.: HarperCollins, 2004). The 
first paragraph of the last chapter (pp. 177-78) sums up 
some of the evidence:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Iraqi intelligence documents from 1992 list Osama 
bin Laden as an Iraqi intelligence asset. Numerous sources have reported a 
1993 nonaggression pact between Iraq and al Qaeda. The former deputy director 
of Iraqi intelligence now in U.S. custody says that bin Laden asked the Iraqi 
regime for arms and training in a face-to-face meeting in 1994. Senior al 
Qaeda leader Abu Hajer al Iraqi met with Iraqi intelligence officials in 1995. 
The National Security Agency intercepted telephone conversations between al 
Qaeda-supported Sudanese military officials and the head of Iraq's chemical 
weapons program in 1996. Al Qaeda sent Abu Abdallah al Iraqi to Iraq for help 
with weapons of mass destruction in 1997. An indictment from the Clinton-era 
Justice Department cited Iraqi assistance on al Qaeda &quot;weapons development&quot; in 
1998. A senior Clinton administration counterterrorism official told the <i>
Washington Post</i> that the U.S. government was &quot;sure&quot; Iraq had supported al 
Qaeda chemical weapons programs in 1999. An Iraqi working closely with the 
Iraqi embassy in Kuala Lumpur was photographed with September 11 hijacker 
Khalid al Mihdhar en route to a planning meeting for the bombing of the USS <i>
Cole</i> and the September 11 attacks in 2000. Satellite photographs showed al 
Qaeda members in 2001 traveling en masse to a compound in northern Iraq 
financed, in part, by the Iraqi regime. Abu Musab al Zarqawi, senior al Qaeda 
associate, operated openly in Baghdad and received medical attention at a 
regime-supported hospital in 2002. Documents discovered in postwar Iraq in 
2003 reveal that Saddam's regime harbored and supported Abdul Rahman Yasin, an 
Iraqi who mixed the chemicals for the 1993 World Trade Center attack...</font></p>

The preliminary

states</a>, &quot;We have no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated on 
attacks against the United States.&quot; Some critics, including the chief prosecutor of 
the World Trade Center bombers,
<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/mccarthy/mccarthy200406170840.asp">have 
argued</a> that the staff report inexplicably ignores substantial evidence of 
Iraqi involvement in the September 11 attacks. The final Commission Report finds 
that there were </font>&quot;friendly contacts&quot; between Al Qaeda and the Saddam 
regime. The Commission does not find that there was a &quot;collaborative 
operational relationship&quot; for &quot;carrying out attacks against the United States.&quot; Whether you agree with the

report, the staff's critics, or the final commission report, there is no dispute that Saddam Hussein 
<a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/351qdcaz.asp">had a relationship</a> with al Qaeda, an organization whose only activity was terrorism.

<p>The 
family of U.S. Air Force Maj. Gregory Stone was shocked to learn that video 
footage of the major's Arlington National Cemetery burial was included by 
Michael Moore in his movie &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11.&quot; <br>
Maj. Stone was killed in March 2003 by a grenade that officials said was 
thrown into his tent by Sgt. Hasan K. Akbar, who is on trial for murder. <br>
&quot;It's been a big shock, and we are not very happy about it, to say the least,&quot; 
Kandi Gallagher, Maj. Stone's aunt and family spokeswoman, tells Washington 
Times reporter Audrey Hudson. <br>
&quot;We are furious that Greg was in that casket and cannot defend himself, and my 
sister, Greg's mother, is just beside herself,&quot; Miss Gallagher said. &quot;She is 
furious. She called him a 'maggot that eats off the dead.'&quot; <br>
The movie, described by critics as political propaganda during an election 
year, shows video footage of the funeral and Maj. Stone's fiancee, Tammie 
Eslinger, kissing her hand and placing it on his coffin. <br>
The family does not know how Mr. Moore obtained the video, and Miss Gallagher 
said they did not give permission and are considering legal recourse. <br>
She described her nephew as a &quot;totally conservative Republican&quot; and said he 
would have found the film to be &quot;putrid.&quot; <br>

whether Moore's usage of the footage was illegal. But it hardly seems ethical

Long before <i>Fahrenheit </i>was released, Moore 
promised that he had videos of Iraqi prisoner abuse. <i>Fahrenheit </i>presents 
a video of making fun of a prostrate Iraqi. To the audience, it 
seems like another Abu Ghraib. Moore told an audience, &quot;</font>You saw this 
morning the first footage of abuse and humiliation of Iraqi detainees.&quot; <i>
Fahrenheit </i>claims: &quot;Immoral behavior breeds immoral behavior. When a

<p>It's not very respectful to make fun

<p>Such teasing is an abuse of power. 
(Although it's a relatively harmless abuse of power, since the only victim can't

torturing a conscious victim. And such insults are not the result of &quot;sending 
otherwise good kids into a war based on a lie&quot;; the insults are the result of 
the fact that law enforcement personnel all over the world have to remove 
comatose drunks from the streets, and law enforcement personnel sometimes make

Bush &quot;supported closing veterans hospitals&quot; says 
Moore. The Bush Department of Veterans Affairs did propose closing seven 
hospitals in areas with declining populations where the hospitals were 
underutilized, and whose veterans could be served by other hospitals. Moore does 
not say that the Department also proposed building <i>new </i>hospitals in areas 
where needs were growing, and also building blind rehabilitation centers and 
spinal cord injury centers. (For more, see the
<a href="http://www1.va.gov/cares/">Final Report</a> of the independent 
commission on veterans hospitals, which agrees with some of the Bush proposals, 
and with some of the objections raised by critics.) </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

According to Moore, Bush &quot;tried to double the 
prescription drug costs for veterans.&quot; What Bush proposed was raising the 
prescription co-pay from $7 to $15, for veterans with incomes of over $24,000 a 
year. Prescription costs would have remained very heavily subsidized by 
taxpayers. Some, not all, veterans would have faced a doubling of their 
prescription co-pay, but only to a level which is common for many people with 
prescription insurance, and hardly a large enough increase to make a great 
difference in most cases.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

Bush, announces Moore, &quot;proposed cutting combat 
soldiers� pay by 33%.&quot; Not exactly. In addition to regular military salaries, 
soldiers in certain areas (not just combat zones) receive an &quot;imminent danger&quot; 
bonus of $150 a month. In April 2003, Congress retroactively enacted a special 
increase of $75, for the fiscal year of Oct. 1, 2002 through Sept. 30, 2003. At 
first, the Bush administration did not support renewing the special bonus, but 
then changed its position.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

Likewise, Congress had passed a special one-year 
increase in the family separation allowance (for service personnel stationed in 
places where their families cannot join them) from $100 to $250. Bush's initial 
opposition to extending the special increase was presented by Moore as 
&quot;cutting assistance to their families by 60%.&quot; (Edward

Epstein</a>, &quot;Pentagon 
reverses course, won�t cut troops� pay,&quot; <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, Aug. 
15, 2003.)</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

Even if one characterizes not renewing a special 
bonus as a &quot;cut,&quot; <i>Fahrenheit </i>misleads the viewer into thinking that the 
cuts applied to total compensation, rather than only to pay supplements which 
constitute only a small percentage of a soldier�s income. An enlisted man with 
four months of experience receives an annual salary more than $27,000. (Rod
<a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/joiningup/a/recruiter5.htm">Powers</a>, 
&quot;What the Recruiter Never Told You: Military Pay.&quot; The figure includes the value 
of health care, housing, and so on.) So allowing the $75 per month supplemental 
bonus to expire would have amounted to a &quot;cut&quot; of only about 3 percent of total 
compensation, even at the lowest levels. So Moore claim of a &quot;33%&quot; cut is a 
ten-fold exaggeration. </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Although Moore presents Bush as cutting military pay, 
Bush did the opposite: in 2003, Congress enacted a Bush administration 
proposal to raise all military salaries by 3.7%, with extra &quot;targeted&quot; pay 
increases for non-commissioned officers. NCOs are lower-ranking officers who 
typically join the military with lower levels of education than commissioned 
officers. (Sgt.

<p>Early in this 
segment, Moore states that &quot;out of the 535 members of Congress, only one had an 
enlisted son in Iraq.&quot; The action of the segment consists of Moore accosting Congressmen to try to 
convince them to have their children enlist in the military. At the end, Moore 
declares, &quot;Not a single member of Congress wanted to sacrifice their child for 
the war in Iraq.&quot;</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore�s 
second statement 
is technically true, but duplicitous. Of course no-one would want to &quot;sacrifice&quot; 
his child in any way. But the fact is, Moore's opening (&quot;only one&quot;) and his 
conclusion (&quot;not a single member&quot;) are both incorrect.

Senator Joseph Biden's son Beau is

in the Judge Advocate General Corps; 
although Beau Biden has no control over where he is deployed, he has not been 
sent to Iraq, and therefore does not &quot;count&quot; for Moore's purposes.
<a href="http://web.naplesnews.com/03/04/naples/d930340a.htm">Seven</a> members 
of Congress have been confirmed to have children in the military.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>How about Cabinet 
members? <i>Fahrenheit </i>never raises the issue, because the answer would not 
fit Moore�s thesis. Attorney General 
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/08/prisoner.abuse.whitehouse.ap/">John Ashcroft�s son</a> is 
serving on the <i>U.S.S. McFaul</i> in the Persian Gulf.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why not 
count Duncan Hunter's son? Note the phrasing: &quot;only one had an enlisted son in 
Iraq.&quot; Although Hunter's son &quot;enlisted&quot; in the Marines, he is a Second 
Lieutenant, which means that he is above the rank of an &quot;enlisted man.&quot; But why 
hide from the viewers how many Congressmen really have sons serving in the 
military in Iraq?</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 
editing of the Congressional scenes borders on the fraudulent: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
�.Representative Kennedy (R-MN), one of the lawmakers accosted in Fahrenheit 
9/11, was censored by Michael Moore. <br>
According to the 
[Minneapolis] <i>
Star Tribune</i>, 
Kennedy, when asked if he would be willing to send his son to Iraq, responded 
by stating that he had a nephew who was en-route to Afghanistan. He went on to 
inform Moore that his son was thinking about a career in the navy and that two 
of his nephews had already served in the armed forces. Kennedy�s side of the 
conversation, however, was cut from the film, leaving him looking bewildered 
and defensive.</p>
<p>
What was Michael�s excuse for trimming the key segment? Kennedy�s 
remarks didn�t help his thesis: &quot;He mentioned that he had a nephew that was 
going over to Afghanistan,&quot; Moore recounted. &quot;So then I said �No, no, that�s 
not our job here today. We want you to send your child to Iraq. Not a 
nephew.�&quot;</p>
<p>
Kennedy lambasted Moore as a &quot;master of the misleading&quot; after 
viewing the interview in question. </p>

<p>George 
Stephanopoulos, of ABC News, asked Moore about the selective cuts in the Kennedy 
footage:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stephanopoulos: 
You have a scene when you�re up on Capitol Hill encountering members of 
Congress, asking them if they would ask their sons and daughters to enlist � 
in the military. And one of those members of Congress who appears in the 
trailer, Mark Kennedy, said you left out what he told you, which is that he 
has two nephews serving in the military, one in Afghanistan. And he went on to 
say that, &quot;Michael Moore doesn�t always give the whole truth. He�s a master of 
the misleading.&quot; </font> </p>
<p>Moore: Well, at 
the time, when we interviewed him, he didn�t have any family members in 
Afghanistan. And when he saw the trailer for this movie, he issued a report to 
the press saying that he said that he had a kid in� </font> </p>
<p>Stephanopoulos: 
He said he told you he had two nephews. </font> </p>
<p>Moore:� No, he 
didn�t. And we released the transcript and we put it on our Web site. This is 
what I mean by our war room. Any time a guy like this comes along and says, &quot;I 
told him I had two nephews and one was going to Iraq and one was going to 
Afghanistan,&quot; he�s lying. And I�ve got the raw footage and the transcript to 
prove it. So any time these Republicans come at me like this, this is exactly 
what they�re going to get. And people can go to my Web site and read the 
transcript and read the truth. What he just said there, what you just quoted, 
is not true. </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>   This Week</i> followed up with the office of Rep. Kennedy. He did have two 
nephews in the military, but neither served in Iraq. Kennedy�s staff agrees 
that Moore�s Website is accurate but insists the movie version is misleading. 
In the film, Moore says, &quot;Congressman, I�m trying to get members of Congress 
to get their kids to enlist in the Army and go over to Iraq.&quot; But, from the 
transcript, here�s the rest:</font></p>
<p>Moore: Is there 
any way you could help me with that?</font></p>
<p>Kennedy: How 
would I help you? </font> </p>
<p>Moore: Pass it 
out to other members of Congress. </font> </p>
<p>Kennedy: I�d be 
happy to � especially those who voted for the war. I have a nephew on his way 
to Afghanistan. </font> </p>

<i>This Week</i></a>, ABC News, June 20, 2004.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So while <i>
Fahrenheit </i>pretended that Kennedy just stupidly looked at Moore, Kennedy agreed to help 
Moore. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notice 
also how Moore phrased his reply to Stephanopoulos: &quot;Any time a guy like this 
comes along and says, 'I told him I had two nephews and one was going to Iraq 
and one was going to Afghanistan,' he�s lying.&quot; But Kennedy never claimed that 
he had a nephew going to Iraq. The insinuation that Kennedy made such a claim is 
a pure fabrication by Moore. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Fahrenheit </i>
shows Moore calling out to Delaware Republican Michael Castle, who is talking on 
a cell phone and waves Moore off. Castle is presented as one of the Congressmen 
who would not sacrifice his children. What the film omits is that Rep. Castle
<a href="http://www.house.gov/castle/bio.html">does not have any children</a>.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Are 
Congressional children less likely to serve in Iraq than children from other 
families? Let�s use Moore�s methodology, and ignore members of extended families 
(such as nephews) and also ignore service anywhere except Iraq (even though U.S. 
forces are currently fighting terrorists in many countries). And like Moore, let 
us also ignore the fact that some families (like Rep. Castle�s) have no 
children, or no children of military age. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We 
then see that of 535 Congressional families, there are two with 
a child who served in Iraq. How does this compare with American families in 
general? In the summer of 2003, U.S. troop levels in Iraq were raised to 
145,000. If we factor in troop rotation, we could estimate that about 300,000 
people have served in Iraq at some point. According to the
<a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/p20-537.pdf">Census Bureau</a>, 
there were 104,705,000 households in the United States in 2000. (See Table 1 of 
the Census Report.) So the ratio of ordinary U.S. households to Iraqi service 
personnel is 104,705,000 to 300,000. This reduces to a ratio of 349:1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 
contrast the ratio of Congressional households to Iraqi service personnel is 
535:2. This reduces to a ratio of 268:1.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Stated another way, a Congressional household is about 23 percent <i>more </i>
likely than an ordinary household to be closely related to an Iraqi serviceman 
or servicewoman. </p>
<p>Of 
course my statistical methodology is very simple. A more sophisticated analysis 
would look only at Congressional and U.S. households from which at least one 
child is legally eligible to enlist in the military. Moore, obviously, never 
attempted such a comparison; instead, he deceived viewers into believing that 
Congressional families were extremely different from other families in 
enlistment rates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore ignores the 
fact that there are <a href="http://grunt.space.swri.edu/housevet.htm">101 
veterans currently serving in the House of Representatives</a> and
<a href="http://grunt.space.swri.edu/senatevet.htm">36 in the Senate</a>. Regardless of whether they have 
children who could join the military, all of the veterans in Congress have 
personally put themselves at risk to protect their country.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>During 
the segment, Moore is accompanied by Corporal Abdul Henderson, a Marine Corps 
Reservist. Corporal Henderson wears several ribbons and medals on his uniform; 
interestingly, a <a href="http://direwolfsg3.tripod.com/sgai/med_rib.htm">Good 
Conduct</a> ribbon or medal, which is

not yet been sent to Iraq. But <i>Fahrenheit </i>premiered at the Cannes Film 
Festival in May 2004--two months after it had been reported that Duncan Hunter's 
son had been sent to Iraq. At the least, Moore could apologize that his claim 
about &quot;only one&quot; child is inaccurate, and blame the error on his having not 
noticed the news about Hunter while the movie was in its final production 
stages. But instead, Moore continues to repeat the &quot;only one&quot; claim, which is

Fahrenheit </i>is correct in pointing out that people who enlist in the military 
are less likely to be college graduates and more likely to be black than is the 
general U.S. population. However, Moore's portrayal of the socioeconomics of the 
U.S. military is false is several respects. First, people who are at the lowest 
end of the economic spectrum--people who have failed to graduate from high 
school or to obtain a G.E.D.--are not over-represented in the military. Like 
college graduates, they are under-represented. In the case of high school 
drop-outs, the reason is that the all-volunteer military can be selective, and 
generally prefers not to enlist high-school drop-outs.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Although blacks are about twice as likely to serve in the military as is the 
general U.S. population, black people do not suffer disproportionate casualties 
in Iraq. </font>

estimates</a> that blacks comprise 12.3% of the U.S. population. 
The reason that black enlistment is disproportionate but black fatalities are 
not is that many blacks in the military serve in 
support roles (such as providing supplies) which are unlikely to suffer high 
rates of casualties. </font>Sydney J.

<p>Mrs. Lipscomb is from Flint, 
Michigan, which Moore calls &quot;my hometown.&quot; In fact, Moore
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-06-20-moore_x.htm">grew 
up in Davison, Michigan</a>, a suburb of Flint. Davison is much wealthier than 
Flint. According to the
<a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/saipe/district.html">Census Bureau</a>, 
6 percent of children in the Davison public schools are from families living in 
poverty, whereas in Flint, 31 percent of children are. Calling Flint your 
&quot;hometown&quot; when you really grew up in Davison is like calling the 
Bronx &quot;my hometown&quot; when you really grew up in Westchester County. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flint is working class, industrial, down-at-heel, where the majority of the 
population is black or Latino. It's where the factories are.</p>
<p>Davison, where Moore grew up and attended Davison High School, is 
comfortable middle class, suburban, and white. Overwhelmingly white. It's 
where the managers and professionals live. While many of the children of Flint 
go on to work at the factories...the 
normal trajectory for the children of Davison is university. Michael Moore 
went to university (though didn't stick long). Unusually, he also went to 
Flint and tried his hand on the blue-collar front line with a job on the Buick 
assembly line for General Motors. He found the conditions under which the 
working class actually worked so appalling he quit the job after one day.</p>

<p>Discussing unemployment rates, Mrs. 
Lipscomb states, &quot;But you have to take into account as well that when your 
unemployment runs out you're no longer counted.&quot; (Presumably she means that when 
your &quot;unemployment insurance benefits&quot; run out, you're no longer counted.) There 
is no reason to doubt her sincerity, but she is incorrect in this regard. The
<a href="http://stats.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm#U">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> 
unemployment rate counts all &quot;Persons 16 years and over who had no employment 
during the reference week, were available for work, except for temporary 
illness, and had made specific efforts to find employment sometime during the 
4-week period ending with the reference week.&quot; The rate has nothing do with 
whether the person is receiving unemployment insurance payments. (For more, see 
the detailed <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/lau/laumthd.htm">BLS explanation</a> 
of how unemployment rates are calculated.) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A curious reader of this article 
wrote to the Michigan Dept. of Labor &amp; Economic Growth/Bureau 
of Labor Market Information &amp; Strategic Initiatives. An official with the 
Michigan Bureau sent back a document (which is apparently not on the Internet) 
titled &quot;Labor Force, Employment, Unemployment, Unemployment Rate 
Estimates For States And Local Areas.&quot; The document explains how unemployment 
rates are calculated. In particular, the document explains the calculated rate 
specifically includes people who have exhausted their unemployment insurance 
benefits, but who are still unemployed. The unemployment rate includes:</font></p>
<blockquote>
An estimate of 
the number of individuals who have used up all of their unemployment benefits, 
but are determined, through estimation, to be still unemployed. <i>A formula 
that utilizes the parallel relationship between the rate of unemployment and 
the duration of unemployment spells, and a quarterly Current Population Survey 
average state duration average, yields a survival rate for a particular area 
depending on that area's current labor market condition. Thus an area with 
high unemployment will have a larger percentage of its unemployment claims exhaustees included into its jobless total. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Italics in original.) The Michigan 
official's letter explained, &quot;In the official statistics we produce (in 
cooperation with the BLS) for the number of unemployed for the state and local 
areas, current unemployment claimants account for about 30 to 40 percent of the 
total unemployed.&quot; <br>
</p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/index.php?id=21">Moore 
response</a>: Does not attempt to explain why he calls Flint &quot;my hometown.&quot; No defense of the misstatement about how unemployment rates are

<p> </p>
<p>In a previous draft, I had cited 
data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that Flint's unemployment 
rate in January 2004 was <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/eag/eag.mi_flint.htm">10 percent</a>, 
and said that <i>Fahrenheit</i>'s claim about a 17 percent rate was incorrect. Moore's response cited the Michigan Dept. of Labor &amp; Economic Growth for a
<a href="http://www.michlmi.org/LMI/lmadata/laus/lausdocs/049lf04.htm">17 
percent rate</a>. The BLS figure (10 percent) is labeled &quot;Flint,&quot; but actually 
includes all of Genesee Country. The Michigan DLEG figure (17 percent) is for the city of 
Flint only. So Moore was correct, and I was incorrect.]</p>

Washington Representative Jim McDermott appears in 
several segments. The McDermott 
quotes are, obviously, not like the deceitful quote of Condoleezza Rice, 
in which her words were chopped to mean the opposite of what she really said. 
McDermott is apparently quite sincere, and there is no indication that anything 
he said was taken out of context. However, McDermott's quotes about the alleged 
motivations of the Bush administration are supported by no evidence, and amount 
to nothing more than the speculative ravings of one of the very few pro-Saddam 
members of Congress--who also
<a href="http://www.siliconindia.com/shownewsdata.asp?newsno=24763">worries</a> 
that bin Laden has already been captured, and will be brought out at an 
opportune time before the election. To rely on McDermott to explain the Bush administration's 
alleged secret intentions is akin to relying on a bitter atheist to describe an 
alleged secret conspiracy in the Vatican.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
In any case, he does make one plain misstatement.
McDermott claims, &quot;Well you make them afraid by creating an aura of endless 
threat. They played us like an organ. They raised the le[vel], the orange up to 
red than they they dropped it back to orange.&quot; To the contrary, the threat level 
has never been raised above orange (high risk). It takes a highly paranoid mind

changes must have been for the purpose of psychological warfare on the American 
people.</font></p>

<p>In <i>

in Iraq�the coalition of Saddam loyalists, al Qaeda operatives, and terrorists 
controlled by Iran or Syria�who are united in their desire to murder Iraqis, and 
to destroy any possibility of democracy in Iraq. Here is what Moore says about 
the forces who are killing Americans and trying to impose totalitarian rule on 
Iraq:</font></p>

<p>
The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not &quot;insurgents&quot; or

believe that any reasonable person can equate people fighting for 
totalitarianism with people fighting for constitutional democracy), then Moore 
is still being dishonest in<i> Fahrenheit</i> when he pronounces his concern for 
American troops. To the contrary, he is cheering for the forces which are 
killing our troops, as he equates the killers with freedom-fighters. And if you 
think that the people who are slaughtering American soldiers, American 
civilians, Iraqi soldiers, and Iraqi civilians are terrorists rather than 
&quot;minutemen,&quot; then it is true that Moore supports terrorists. By the

<p>According to <i>

and two screens in Syria. 
<a href="http://www.ict.org.il/inter_ter/st_terror/syrian_terror.htm">Syria is a terrorist state</a> which invaded Lebanon in

<p> </p>
<p>Moore accuses the 
United States of sacrificing morality because of greed: &quot;The motivation for war

<p> </p>
<p>Yet it turns out 
that the self-righteous Moore is the one who is accepting aid from a terrorist 
organization which has murdered and kidnapped hundreds of Americans--and also an 
organization that works with Zarqawi and al Qaeda. Just to 
avoid a boycott on a dozen screens in a totalitarian terrorist state and its 
colony? </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore is, with 
terrorist assistance, pushing the film in Syria and a Syrian colony, both of 
which are places which supply some of the fighters who are currently killing 
Americans and anti-totalitarian Iraqis. <i>Fahrenheit </i>presents the fighters 
as noble resistance, and the American presence as entirely evil. It's not that 
the content of <i>Fahrenheit </i>is all that different from the propaganda which 
pervades the state-controlled Arab media, or on al Jazeera. But <i>Fahrenheit</i>'s 
may be more persuasive, to at least some of its Arab audience, because its 
denunciations of American and praise for the Iraqi insurgents comes from an 
American. It is 
reasonable to expect that such a film, when shown in Syria and Lebanon, will aid in the recruiting of 
additional fighters to kill Americans and Iraqis. In effect, the presentation of <i>
Fahrenheit</i> in Syria and Lebanon--especially with explicit endorsement from a 
terrorist organization--amounts to a recruiting film for terrorists (or, in 
Moore's terms, &quot;minutemen&quot;) to go to Iraq and kill Americans. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
Hezbollah likes the film so much that the terrorist organization has shown it on 
one of its television stations:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti-American Arab television stations, including one owned by the Lebanese 
branch of the Hezbollah, have broadcast chunks of Moore's attack on Bush with 
commentaries more virulent than the original. </p>
<p>&quot;We may not be able to drive the Americans out of Iraq,&quot; says Sheikh Hassan 
Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader in Lebanon. &quot;But we can drive Bush out of the 
White House by heating things up in Iraq.&quot; Bush is also seen as too pro-Israel 
in his Middle East policy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<i><a href="http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/27021.htm">New 
York Post</a></i>, Aug. 18, 2004). Fidel Castro likewise showed the film on 
Cuban state television, because the film fit his own message of the evil of the 
United States. (Since <i>Fahrenheit </i>is still in theatrical release, these 
broadcasts may not have been specifically authorized by Moore. But it does say 
something that Hezbollah and the Cuban tyrant find <i>Fahrenheit </i>such a 
congenial movie.)</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because 
of Syria's oppression of Lebanon and its support for terrorism in Iraq and other 
nations, Congress passed and President Bush signed the </font>
<font face="Times New Roman" color="black">
<a href="http://www.thepalmerpress.com/meib16.html">Syria Accountability and 
Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act</a>. The Act authorizes the U.S. government 
to freeze the assets of individuals or organizations &quot;who are determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be or 
to have been directing or otherwise significantly contributing to&quot; Syrian 
sponsorship of terrorist organizations or the destabilization Iraq.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Theoretically, it 
might be possible that Moore has no personal awareness that his Middle East 
distributor is working with terrorists. But such ignorance is unlikely for two 
reasons: First, Moore�s &quot;war room&quot; staff monitors controversial articles about 
the film, and there could hardly be anything more controversial than making 
common cause with terrorists. Not only has the <i>Hezbollah </i>relationship been publicized in a leading film trade on-line newspaper, the Moore-<i>Hezbollah
</i>connection has been reported in one of the very most significant British 
newspapers, and in an important American on-line newspaper.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Second, Moore was
<a href="http://rogerlsimon.com/archives/00001064.htm">personally questioned</a> 
about the terrorist connection at a Washington, D.C., press conference. He at 
first denied the terrorist connection, but was then confronted with the direct 
quote from his distributor. He stonewalled and refused to answer. So the man who 
spends so much time getting in other people�s faces with tough questions is 
unwilling to explain why he is accepting aid from Hezbollah.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>By way 
of reply, Moore could have said, &quot;I sold the Middle East distribution rights to 
FRE, so I can't legally control what they do. But I strongly condemn their 
relationship with Hezbollah, and I've already told them that if they don't stop 
cooperating with Hezbollah, they will never distribute another movie of mine. I 
think it's reprehensible for any business to accept terrorist assistance.&quot; But 
instead, he stonewalls. Likewise, his website has provided no explanation of 
Moore's conduct regarding Hezbollah.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Fahrenheit </i>
stitches together some
<a href="http://forums.newspeakdictionary.com/viewtopic.php?p=4215#4215">
scattered line</a>s from the screenplay of <i>1984</i>, written by
</font><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0079369/">Ralph Gilbert Bettison</a> 
and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0854789/">William Templeton</a>. Moore 
implies that the words are those of George Orwell, although the quotes do not come 
from George Orwell's novel <i>1984. </i>The screenplay depicts
a 
totalitarian state perpetually at war,
</font>and does accurately capture many of the points made in Orwell's book. As Moore quotes 
&quot;Orwell&quot; (actually, Bettison and Templeton): &quot;The war is not 
meant to be won, but it is meant to be continuous...A hierarchical society is 
only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance... The war is waged by the 
ruling group against its own subjects and its object is not the victory over 
either Eurasia or east Asia but to keep the very structure of society intact.&quot; The real purpose of war as 
&quot;to keep the very structure of society intact.&quot; <i>Fahrenheit </i>applies &quot;Orwell�s&quot; words to the United States of today.
</font>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moore�s purported 
positions on some issues in <i>Fahrenheit </i>are different from his previous 
positions: whether people should have made a big deal about September 11, 
whether Osama bin Laden is guilty of the September 11 attacks, whether American 
families, including the Lipscombs, deserve to suffer the deaths of their 
children because they supported the war. But throughout Michael Moore�s career, 
he has remained true to the central theme of <i>Fahrenheit</i>: capitalist 
America is the real terrorist state. Because America is a capitalist society, 
American use of force is necessarily evil. (Or as the <i>
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?040216fa_fact7">New Yorker</a>
</i>reported, &quot;</font>He believes that the United States should not take 
military action under any circumstances except emergency self-defense.&quot;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Four days after 
September 11, Moore
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010917014615/www.michaelmoore.com/2001_0915.html">
announced</a>: &quot;We, the United States of America, are culpable in committing so 
many acts of terror and bloodshed that we better get a clue about the culture of 
violence in which we have been active participants.&quot; (The statement has been 
deleted from Moore�s website, but is available through the web archive service 
called the Wayback Machine.) This is the view of <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i>: Iraq 
under Saddam was fine until America began terrorizing it. </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein 
agrees; after September 11, his government issued an
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/09/12/mideast.reaction/">official 
statement</a> declaring, &quot;The American cowboys are reaping the fruit of their 
crimes against humanity.&quot; Saddam's media showed him
<a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_397066.html?menu=">telling his 
generals</a>, &quot;Those who do not want to harvest evil, should not plant 
evil...Despite the contradictory humanitarian feelings on what happened in 
America, America is harvesting the thorns that its rulers have planted in the 
world...Nobody has crossed the Atlantic carrying weapons against America, but it 
has crossed the Atlantic carrying death and destruction to the whole world.&quot; 
</font></p>

Moore in his own words</a>.&quot; One of the
<a href="http://moorewatch.com/index.php/weblog/comments/803/">posters</a> for 
the European release of <i>Fahrenheit </i>features a burning American flag, with 
a cloudy death's-head skull in place of the white stripes.</font></p>

</font>
<p> </p>
<p>Throughout American 
history, there have always been patriotic Americans who criticized particular 
war-time policies, or who believed that a war was a mistake and should be 
promptly ended. Today, there are 
many patriotic Americans who oppose some or all aspects of the War on Terror. I 
am among them, in that I have strongly
<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel092101.shtml">opposed the USA PATRIOT Act</a> from its first days, have denounced the Bush administration for 
siding with corporate interests rather than with public safety by sabotaging
<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel070203.asp">the Armed Pilots 
law</a>, and have repeatedly stated that the current Saudi tyranny should be 
recognized as a major part of the problem in the War on Terror--despite the 
tyranny's close relationship with America's foreign policy 
�lite.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast to the 
large number of patriots who have argued against particular wars or wartime 
policies, a much smaller number of Americans have hated America. They 
have cheered for the fighters who were killing Americans. They have belittled America�s 
right to protect itself, and they have produced propaganda designed to destroy 
American morale and to facilitate enemy victory. To advance their anti-American 
cause, they have sometimes feigned love for the nation they despised. </font> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, during the Vietnam War, 
many sincere patriots--such as George McGovern and Robert Kennedy--opposed the 
war. But some people actively collaborated with the totalitarian government
of Ho Chi Minh, and the totalitarian armies of the Khmer Rouge and the
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~laohumrights/laowht02.html">Pathet Lao</a>. 
These people tried to convince the American public that the soldiers who 
were killing American troops were fighting in a just cause. They were not; they 
were fighting for Stalinism and genocide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Do the many 
falsehoods and misrepresentations of <i>Fahrenheit 9/11 </i>suggest a film 
producer who just makes careless mistakes? Or does a man who
<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/content_objectid=13583626_method=full_siteid=50143_headline=-THE-AWKWARD-CONSCIENCE-OF-A-NATION-name_page.html">calls Americans</a> 
&quot;possibly the 
dumbest people on the planet&quot; believe that his audience will be too dumb to tell 
when he is tricking them? Viewers will have to decide for themselves whether the 
extremist and extremely deceptive <i>Fahrenheit 9/11 </i>is a conscientious work 
of patriotic dissent, or the cynical propaganda of a man who gives wartime aid 
to America�s murderous enemies, and who accepts their aid in return.</font></p>
