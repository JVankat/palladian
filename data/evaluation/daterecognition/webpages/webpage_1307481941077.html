Hope you enjoy reading this ^_^</p><p>I started writing chapter 12 almost immediately after finishing chapter 11, and for the past months, to my chagrin, it's been languishing on some 400+ words, until I found a concert footage of "Dress" performed by Abingdon Boys School with Sakurai Atsushi of Buck-Tick, and that really gave the muse a much-needed hit upside the head *lol* Seriously, that performance was just epic: the abs cover of "Dress" with the voice of Buck-Tick himself. I totally recommend watching it.</p><p>Thanks to DarkScrivener for beta reading.</p><p><hr size=1 noshade><p><u>Chapter 12</u>: <i>In heaven whenever I see you<br>I drop all my weapons<br>You tell me the meaning to life<br>How you drive me mad</i></p><p><i><p>INSANE, MY PAIN, I'm screaming on the inside<br>Awake to the justice<br>AGAIN, IN VAIN, I'm reaching for an answer<br>My tragedy just fades away<br>I dedicate it all to you</p><p>No one will last in disguise<br>Time flies like an arrow<br>Under your halo, I'll surrender</p><p>In heaven whenever I feel you<br>I'll unload my handgun<br>You give me the will to go on<br>Do I drive you mad</p></i><p><i>INSANE, MY PAIN, I'm rushing to the outside<br>Now over the distance<br>I PRAY, IN RAIN, you're tearing off the cancer<br>My destiny will break away<br>I wanna make it up to you</i><br>— Abingdon Boys School, "Valkyrie"</p><p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"Father! Father Nightroad!" Esther screamed herself hoarse, repeating his name. Nothing but the turbulent crash of waves on the rocks from the darkness below greeted her. She was oblivious to the rest of the guard and staff imploring her to move away from the balcony and into the safety of the palace. All she knew was that she couldn't move from this place. Too many thoughts churned through her head; her heart was filled with befuddlement. She didn't quite understand why she had felt her heart sinking in her chest when she witnessed the exchange between Father Nightroad and the assassin; didn't want to acknowledge the hurt and confusion she felt when he had bypassed her to chase after that shadow. Was that what he had been waiting for? And for what purpose?</p><p>Admittedly, in the beginning, though she had chosen to stifle her curiosity, it was not an easy feat. Having him around reminded her of her time with AX; but the solemn air that had surrounded him all throughout his stay made it hard for her to grow accustomed to him. He had been like a ghost, an entirely new person enshrouded in shadows and secrets, too lost within layers of grief for her to reach. A part of Esther wanted his acknowledgment of what she so far had accomplished since ascending the throne of Albion. It was a selfish wish, she knew, but he had been a constant in her life since that fateful day they met in Istvan, and she wanted to be seen as more than a subordinate, and more than a ruler.</p><p>"Esther!" Ion's concerned voice came through the throng of guards around her as he came bursting through them. "Esther, I'm sorry to come so late. Are you alright?"</p><p>She blinked, prying her gaze away from below to stare at him. "Excellency. I-I'm fine."</p><p>"I heard you've been shot at—"</p><p>She shook her head. "It was nothing. It was actually me who did the shooting."</p><p>He reached out his hands, but at the last moment faltered from touching her. "You're not hurt?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>He nodded with a sigh of relief. "What happened?"</p><p>Esther turned her gaze back to the sea. "There was a woman. I think she snuck into the palace and into my room—"</p><p>"Did she—"</p><p>"No… I shot at her before she had any chance to do anything to me, and then Father Nightroad came and—"</p><p>"Abel? Where is he?"</p><p>"He's down there. He went after her."</p><p>"…Her," echoed Ion, perturbance wrinkling his brow, leaning over to stare beyond the railing. Even with the enhanced vision of the Methuselah, he couldn't see much. He frowned at the faint, zigzagging spark that lit up that darkness. Beneath his fingertips on the stone balcony and his feet on the ground, he felt a slight vibration that had his senses clamouring in alarm. He felt the beat of his heart quickening with dread as he turned to Esther.</p><p>"We should leave his retrieval to your men," said Ion urgently, moving to grasp her arm, but mindful of actually touching her due to the guards. "Whoever sent that assassin might have more hiding close by. It's not safe for you to be out here."</p><p>And then they both felt it: the burst of static charges in the air, their hairs standing on end. The ground beneath their feet started to rumble and shake.</p><p>Ion's eyes widened in trepidation. "Esther!" he shouted just as the cliff that supported the balcony they leaned on collapsed, and plunged down into the darkened sea.</p><p><hr size=1 noshade><p>A forceful tremour brought her to consciousness. Lilith floated, movements slow and languid, limbs at the mercy of the push and pull of her surroundings. She felt the heaviness of space, that great black vastness that stretched on, surrounding her. If she could but open her heavy eyes, she knew she'd see the brightness and the loneliness of stars, and the Earth—that world that had borne her—falling away forever. It nagged at the back of her mind, that ineffable thought, that though she was created by that world, she'd also been rejected by it, and that she'd see this mirrored so plainly in the faces of her companions. And so she pushed and shoved the idea from her mind, buried it so deeply as to have no traces of it.</p><p>She tried to open her eyes, and in seeped salty water that stung more than tears. With a start she realized where she was: the heaviness she mistook for space was, in fact, the sea. Their vastness and boundlessness had been indistinguishable.</p><p>Slowly, she became aware: of pain receding from several wounds on her chest and a gash at her shoulder; of something flowing out of her that had slowed to a trickle; of a stirring in her belly. At the last moment during the fall from the cliff, something took over her, transformed her, and cocooned her in the safety of the sea while repairing the damage she'd sustained. The blood from the last few weeks had definitely helped.</p><p><i>Abel</i>, she mouthed, bubbles forming her words and flowing away from her. She could still feel the heaviness of his hands on her—that wanted so much to tighten, to brand, to shackle—and the weight of despair over their union. It all happened so fast: a small grain of a second—found, only to be lost again.</p><p>She reached up to touch her throat amidst the tangle of hair. She swallowed, exercising muscles that she knew shouldn't be able to move any longer. Death had claimed her, hadn't it? The last thing she remembered was the lance that had fallen and felled her. But that same face, with its hunger and its madness, had stared back at her when she'd first woken.</p><p>Lilith sifted through the memories that engulfed her mind, tried to make sense of the actions taken, the words said and left unsaid, tried to get a bearing of her own self through all of them. Always, at the forefront floated images of Abel—the root that enabled her to take hold of her mind once and for all.</p><p>Muffled gurgling filled her ears, and it hurt to open her eyes. The salt of the sea mingled with the salt of dried tears. A sigh escaped in bubbles as she floated deep beneath the waves. Maybe she could stay down here forever, her final escape.</p><p>Despair loomed and hovered. She stroked her hand across her belly, mentally chiding the entity within for not letting her have her rest. It was not the first time she thought of it as a parasite nestling within her, ironically seeming to have been borne out of love. Knowing the nature of the Krusniks was enough to lead her to believe it would destroy the world once it reached full term, if she ever let it get that far. It had been the soundest decision she had ever made to let herself be killed. She thought, after saving what was left of the world from the Knightlord siblings, that she could save it from the destruction that would eventually come from 04 and this.</p><p>She spread her limbs out, limp, letting the pull of the undertow lead her where it may. She couldn't surface yet. She needed time to ruminate, to get to know the world she had woken up in, to see how different it was from before, to see what had changed. The glimpse she had of the world from a mind that wasn't fully conscious and in someone else's control was not enough to give her a full impression. And as much as her heart yearned, she knew she couldn't see Abel again. Not yet, not so soon. There were so many things that she had to figure out, and it would be better for her to quench her desire to run to him if she were far away.</p><p>But before that, there was a shackle she must break. The blue wings unfurled behind her and polychromed into the shades of sunset. The nanomachines crawled along her skin, and she felt a snap against her limbs as they dissevered the Biotechnological Threads that had bound her to that young devil with the angelic face.</p><p><i>And so, farewell</i>, she bade as the sea swept her away.</p><p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The nanomachine wings dissipated, and his long nails dug into his palm as his fists clenched tightly. Abel stood rigid on the rocks, only now through the numbness feeling the spray of the tides against him, his clothing and hair damp.</p><p>He looked up to the still-night sky, feeling the vast and empty world looming around him, mirroring the helplessness he had felt when he had left this planet so very long ago. His jaw quivered before he let a shout erupt, hoping it would reach that unceasing darkness, but even as he released it all out he felt unrelinquished from it.</p><p>Along with rage, hopelessness filled him. Twice now she had been within his reach, close enough for all his senses to be filled with her but he just could not hold her in his grasp.</p><p>For the first time in a long time since he became a Krusnik, he wanted to unleash its power and raze the world to the ground.</p><p>Behind him, he felt a sudden gush of displaced air as wings flapped, and he heard the sound of soft steps of bare feet on the rocks. It was all Abel could do to contain his fury at this intrusion. He was all too aware that this was not the place to unleash it; there was a castle that stood at the cliff's edge just above him.</p><p>"My, my, how careless indeed," said the interloper chidingly. "I practically handed her to you on a platter, and yet you still managed to clumsily mangle up this opportunity. You amaze me, 02."</p><p>"I should kill you where you stand," Abel responded gruffly through clenched teeth. He breathed heavily, his skin tingling with the crackle of electricity as the nanomachines awakened once more.</p><p>The man behind him laughed. "Despite your vow to her? I've returned what I've taken from you, shouldn't we call this even? You now have no reason for revenge."</p><p>The voice that resounded from Abel's throat was guttural with a mechanical edge. "Then why does she run from me?"</p><p>"Who knows what lies inside the dusty ghost of a woman's heart?"</p><p>He shook his head, sealed his lids tightly over his eyes as he took a deep, shaky breath. "Leave, Cain, before I lose whatever control I have left."</p><p>"Oh, you're showing mercy, 02?" Cain admonished mockingly. "How magnanimous of you! She herself had none for those vampires she massacred in Londinium. You're aware of that, yes? Or do you fear for the humans above us? Will you be able to save them from yourself, oh, Enemy of the World?"</p><p>"Enough."</p><p>"Have you looked at yourself lately? That face you make is something I haven't seen in so long. I have found the very thing that has turned you back to Contra Mundi. Her death caused you to abandon your hate, and behold what her resurrection has wrought!"</p><p>"Shut up," the words rumbled harshly from Abel's throat.</p><p>"Before me stands the paragon of wrath—"</p><p>"Shut up."</p><p>"—You must feel it. The Krusnik within you is crying out with joy that their container is no longer a dog with its tail cut off—"</p><p>Abel turned, gaze piercing and crimson, finally managing to silence his sworn adversary, the man he called brother nearly a millennium ago. As though sensing the murderous atmosphere that emanated from the black-clad figure, the tides became even more tumultuous, roaring against the rocky outcrop they stood on, baptizing both with its spray.</p><p>"Nanomachine Krusnik 02—"</p><p>"—Yes—"</p><p>"—Release of restrictions at—"</p><p>"—Give in and unbind them, brother—"</p><p>The sound of the waves drowned out Abel's voice. Jagged, blue cracks of electricity flared out from the night-dark wings that sprouted from his back, and the Krusnik nanomachines as one opened their maws to engulf everything in their path.</p><p><hr size=1 noshade><p>x</p><p>x</p><p>x</p><p>x</p><p>x</p><p>x</p><p>x</p><p>x</p><p>x</p><p>x</p><p>Thanks for reading!
