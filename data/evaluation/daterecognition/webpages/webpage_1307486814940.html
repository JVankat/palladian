<h4>Called to minister deliverance *Powerful!!*</h4>
<p><b>Sent in by Josephine</b></p>
<i>
<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>Thanks for being there brother! I found very good materials in your website, something very new to us. Our orientation is more of Baptist theology, so gifts and spiritual warfare is very foreign to us, specially demon possession. Then suddenly, we were faced with actual cases of demon possession, not just one but nine of them! During the first week, we fought the demons with prayer and love. We didn't believe we had the power and authority to use Jesus' name, so all we did was pray and whenever they turn violent, we tell them we love them and they just faint under the power of love, but they manifest daily without ceasing. We had no rest nor  sleep nor food and we got so exhausted as the days went by. In desperation, we tried to use the Name of Christ and surprise! They tremble and shiver but we couldn't still cast them out. We employed the help of more than 20 Pastors from different churches but to no avail. Some of them won't even believe that the kids are possessed. Some of them thought we're out of our minds, that we were imagining things. They wouldn't believe that we saw the victims float on air, and show all signs of demon possession as you describe it in your website. Still others used the Name of Jesus but the demons just wouldn't budge. As the days went by, we learned how to use our authority and we could already command the demons to walk, to eat, to take a bath, all sorts of things except leaving the body. Then we found out that the family of the children who were afflicted were deeply involved in witchcraft and one of them even participated in Satanic rituals. What we learned from you website is invaluable. After fasting and cleansing the whole family (3 generations of them) of their generational sins, soul ties, witchcraft and other curses, the demons finally left without a fight, exactly 1 month after the fist attack. Now we're very confident that we are very well equipped to handle demonic possession and oppression of any kind. It's like we learned the lesson of a lifetime. On top of that, we are now confident that we have the authority to heal the sick. </p>
<p>What we've learned from your website have strengthened us so much, you are mightily used of God!</p>
<p>Josephine</p>

<h4>Dealing with stubborn demons</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>
<p>I just wanted to share a testimony about a short deliverance that took place yesterday. A young woman was feeling panic and an unhealthy fear of what God is doing in these end days. We begin to confront the demons, and they manifested, but weren't going anywhere. At once point, this demon (I presume it was a spirit of fear) rose up and I felt this hovering evil presence about the person's body... it was very evident had you of been there! I kept going after these demons, but they just wouldn't budge... I must have commanded them to come out 30 times or so, with no avail! I demanded the spirit to tell me it's legal right, and it shook it's head (as in no). The person said they heard a voice that said, "NO."</p>
<p>Finally, I said, "Panic, I take all the pain, torment, and evil done to this person and to every generation up, and I multiply it 7 times greater and submit unto you the judgment of Almighty God!" then I slammed the Bible against the person's shoulder and said, "Receive the wrath of God!"... <b>WOWZA, did that throw the demon in serious torment... you could see it all over the face!</b></p>
<p>I kept pressing forward trying to drive it out, but again, with no avail... I kept going and going, and it refused to leave! I would have thought by now, it would have moved out, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>Then I said to the spirit, "Panic, do you want me to tell the angels of God to torment you?" and it shook it's head... "Then you'd better come out right now," I said. I continued my attempt to drive it out but still it would not leave.</p>
<p>Alright, by now I have had it, so I stepped back and said, "Angels of God who are present in this room, I want you to begin tormenting this foul spirit!" WOWZA! Again, <b>horror ripped across the face and emotions begin to really surface by that time as the Holy Angels were tormenting this demon.</b></p>

<p>Then I begin to command the spirits to come out, and this time, they left without a fight. They were worn down by all the torment and judgment that I called upon them.</p>
<p>Finally after the last spirit left, <b>there was a major breakthrough and release</b> that the person experienced! <u>Her face was glowing like you would not believe</u>... totally the opposite of what I was seeing just minutes earlier! The entire deliverance lasted for roughly 20 minutes.</p>
<p>GLORY to the LIVING God!!! </p>

<h4>Recent healing of another man's knee</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>

<i>
<p>Last night I was at somebody's house who had hurt their knee, so I prayed for them, rebuked the pain and <u>God healed them instantly right there on the spot!</u> He looked at me, rubbed his knee and said, "<b>Bob, the pain is GONE!</b>" Praise God!!!
<p><b>*UPDATE*</b> I talked with him yesterday, and come to find out he recently experienced pain in his other knee, but rather than living with it, he decided to do as I told him and rebuke the pain. <b>He said the pain went right away and never came back!!</b></p>

<h4>Leg lengthened at church</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>
<p>Well, today after the service, a small group of us prayed over a man's leg (which was almost 2 inches shorter than the other) and God grew the shorter leg out to match the longer one!!!</p>

<p>GLORY TO THE LIVING GOD!!!!</p>

<h4>A precious sister's deliverance</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Shae</b></p>
<i>
<p>First I would like to say THANK YOU for your heart felt prayers and interceding, words of encouragement and strength you gave me! I feel soooooooooo much better and stronger in the Lord! This was an experience like never before and it has taken me higher and deeper in our Heavenly Father. Secondly I would like to say that this is no ordinary group, This group is life changing and a definite threat and Weapon to the enemy. My husband was with me and very active in taking part of the deliverance. I don't remember it by minute detail, but my husband said that when the minister called for the spirit of fat/obesity, the spirit spoke and said "i want to kill her". I remember voices, voices, voices! and i remember as he called for the different spirits they manifested by the result of their name, for example the spirit of rejection was called on to be cast out and i couldn't look no one in the eyes as the same for shame and guilt, for pain and memories there was a lot of hurting and crying involved but the minister said that was just a smoke screen and consistently called them out and they expelled by me coughing them up. Fear and unbelief were the biggies, but guess what, No MORE. Glory to God in the Highest!!!! I'd been mentally abused, molested, raped, addicted to porn secretly, among so many other things but Now I'm Free! AND WHOM THE SON SETS FREE IS FREE INDEED! I gotta give the Lord a hand clap of Praise behind that! Listen, if you've never been through one of these, I strongly suggest it because it was things I wasn't even aware of that was dealt with. Nevertheless know that YOU ALL played a part in this and I give God the Glory, and pray blessings upon each of you and your families! you are not grouped here by chance but by divine direction and the devil don't like it because we're BLESSED LIKE THAT!</p>

<h4>Woman delivered from a spirit of death</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>

<i>
<p>This morning we walked a young woman through deliverance from a spirit of death. The demon manifested, and when I demanded its name the spirit spoke out and said DEATH. The demon was cast out and the woman set free. She's experienced a drastic release from the tormenting bondage and has been glowing all day!</p>

<h4>Delivered from mental illness</h4>
<p><b>Posted by David</b></p>
<i>
<p>As a christian years ago I was taught christians can not have demons. My pride and deception and my ego kept me from the truth for a long time. I had learned the hard way. I ended up in a mental Hospital and no treatment realy help me. After I got to my lowest part in my life I sumitted to a deliverance meeting and received much help. That was back in 1992. I am no longer in a mental Hospital, they kick me out. They said I was doing very well and I did not belong there no more. So the last 14 years I have study and learn about Deliverance and Deliverance Ministries... It is normal to have some fear of the unknown. After my first time of getting help my fear turn to courage, stronger Faith and looking forward to kicking the powers of darkness out of me and helping others to receive the same freedom.</p>

<h4>Deliverance from oppressive spirit(s)!</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>

<i>
<p>Last night we prayed over a young woman who was battling an oppressive spirit that was trying to cause her to doubt her salvation, fears of the unpardonable sin, etc. I began to confront the spirits and they manifested.... she was bent over sobbing and coughing as the spirits were cast out!</p>
<p><b>Today she said that she feels much better... the spirit that was tormenting her is gone!</b></p>

<h4>Bad soul tie brought demons</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>
<p>A while back, I ministered deliverance counseling to a young man who was being visited by demons at night. It was awful, he would hear them, see things happening around him, etc. The night I got in touch with him, he didn't want to goto bed it was so bad. As we were talking about the possible entry points in his life for the demon, he remembered that he had a girl friend who was into witchcraft. I asked him if he had ungodly relations with her, and he said that he did. Through those ungodly relations, a soul tie was formed, and either her or the demons in her were using it to send evil his way.</p>
<p>I led him to through breaking the soul tie and legal grounds in Jesus' name. I told him if this doesn't do the trick, then please seek further help to have spirits cast out. (Sometimes all that's needed is the breaking up of some legal grounds, but not always... often spirits do need to be driven out.)</p>
<p>A month later, I had an opportunity to ask him how he was doing. He said he was doing good, and that <u>the demonic attacks/visitations have stopped completely!</u></p>

<h4>Binding demon spirits</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>
<p>I work with a company where you're meeting with new people, and constantly have a nice variety of people to face and sometimes *cough* deal with. Not that long ago, the company was up against a very sticky situation with a client. The person was by far the worse we have ever dealt with. She was nearly impossible to please. She made working with her nearly impossible and VERY difficult. She would get on the phone, and cause somebody to just shake in their boots the way she carried on. When we finally got her satisfied, she changed her mind on her order and decided to dump us. She threatened to take us to court over a petty few hundred dollars (which was WELL earned). She demanded that we give her back all the money she spent with us. (hello?? the work was already done!!!) I just knew we were dealing with a demon in her (and we were!).</p>
<p>Anyways, the big meeting was approaching, where we were just going to give her back the money she spent with us and tell her to move on. That day, a couple of us went together and bound up the demon spirits in this woman before she arrived. She pulled up with her boyfriend or husband, and he stayed out in the car. She came into the office, and <u>her whole personality made a 180 change... you would NOT know this was the same person! She started crying and was bawling in the office</u>... somebody handed her a box of tissues, and when she was done, she had a mound of them laying there... <u>she stared at one of the employees and said "WHO ARE YOU???????" and kept bawling</u>... the employee (who is a Christian) was telling her about Jesus, and she was soaking it up.</p>
<p>I just thought you might enjoy that testimony, where the weapon of binding was put into action, and DRASTIC results came fourth! What an awesome God we serve, to give us the authority over the demons like that!!</p>

<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>
<p>I was talking with young woman, and she said that she felt a dark heaviness feeling since looking at some false teachings one day. She also felt a rebellion stir up in her as she tried to get into God's Word. I told her to repent for looking at the false teachings, renounce the spirit of error and command it to leave. As she followed those steps, <u>she felt pressure build in her chest and then the spirit departed</u>. Afterwards she was amazed, and said that before it left she felt like she was breathing smog, but afterwards she felt like she was breathing fresh air!! What a difference!!!</p>

<p>I invited our worship team to lead in worship, and I went in the back to drink some water. A sister came up to me (who I prayed over at a conference earlier this year) and said when I was speaking the girl that she brought for prayer started to experience extreme pain and got very agitated to the point she had to leave temporary. I told her that it was not unusual for the unclean spirits to react this way when truth is spoken about them. She then asked if I could pray over her. I told her that there was other people I had to minister first too, and if she didn't mind waiting I would.</p>
<p>It was around 9:30 pm when I sat her in a chair next to me, and asked this 19 year old girl where she fellowshipped at and how long she has been a believer. She said she's been a believer for 3 years and came over from another island to dorm at our local University for school. She then told what she was experiencing physical pain when I was speaking and got very agitated. She needed prayer because she been struggling with "stuff" and have a hard time reading the bible and going to church. I told her that I was going to invite the Holy Spirit to come and to reveal whatever needs to be revealed. Within maybe 5-10 seconds in my prayer she started to demonically react. I then started to sever all communications between the spirits, and forbade them to draw strength from each other. I started to break curses over her, and then she started to fall from her chair to the floor. I then brought her up to the alter area where there was carpet and continued as she lied down. Through the process, these were the spirits that were identified and casted out:</p>
Suicide<br />
Murder<br />
Death<br />
Deception<br />
Fear<br />
Guilt<br />

Hatred<br />
<p>I won't get into the specifics, but during this process, I was sworn at, mocked and hit once on my arm. I was told, " I hate you, and you're gonna get it!" I was told "Let's make a deal!' Of course, I told the spirit the only deal we'll make is your departure to the feet of Jesus! Her speech was hindered. Bear in mind, the demons were commanded to not to harm anyone and to obey my commands. They continued to resist, but this I know is normal. They cause the sister to comatose several times, but through experience you command and pursue. As per my posts, I'm a supporter in identifying the spirits and their stronghold. Do I do this with every spirit? No, only the ones that I sense I need to. Death was the strongman over Murder and Suicide. Death came in when she attempted suicide because she felt she was alone and no one cared about her. This was spoken thru her by the spirit in a very raspy and low voice. I then commanded Death to go down and the sister to come back up. I had her renounce Death, Murder and Suicide, and ask the Lord for forgiveness. I then casted the spirits out. I then called up the next spirit and Deception came up. What was the stronghold? Under command, Deception said she feels God does not love her. If He did he wouldn't have allowed her to go thru what she has been going thru. (What a deception!) I commanded Deception to go back down and brought the sister back up and asked her if she doubted God and his love because of what God has allowed her to go thru. She asked me how did I know? I told her that God loves her and He thru the power of the Holy Spirit is revealing information that will set her free. I told her the Adversary has deceived her in allowing her to believe that God allowed things to happened to her because He does not love her. I told her that God do love her and that is why He has brought her here tonight. I then led her thru a prayer of repentance and renouncement and asked the Lord for his forgiveness. Deception was then casted out. Fear came in when she came to the University with no friends, no one to talk to, new environment, knowing no one. Fear was then casted out. Guilt was then identified. After commanding the spirit of Guilt to tell me how he entered in, he told me she stole gum from a store when she was 12. When I brought the sister back up, I asked her if she stole gum from a store when she was 12. She said Yes! and how did I know? Again I reminded her of God's love. She said she remembered the incident and the name of the store, and how she felt so guilty of doing such a crime. The next and last spirit was Hatred. He challenged me and refuse to reveal his name. Thru experience when this happens, I then seek after how he entered in. The spirit then told me when she was nine, her friends and relatives at a party made fun of her for the way she was dressed. At that point she hated everyone! I caught that and commanded the spirit to speak truth and tell me if you're Hatred. The demon did confirm he was Hatred. I again brought the sister back up and asked her if she went to a party when she was 9 and her friends and relatives made fun of her because of the way she was dressed? She said, " How did you know that, yes it is true!" I led her in forgiving those who made fun at her at the party and asked the Lord for his forgiveness for harboring hatred. Hatred was then casted out!</p>
<p>There were many obstacles during the evening, for those of you who minister in this area, you know what I'm talking about. After the last spirit was casted out you could literally see the change in her physical appearance, especially her countenance! You could literally see the joy. There was such a dramatic change! This took a total of approx 3 hrs. It was completed at 12:30 am. After I asked the Lord to fill her the Holy Spirit, she said she felt light and that she knew oppression has lifted. Throughout the ordeal, she wrenched in pain because of the hindrance the demons were causing. She then had no pain at the end! I told her to come back as a follow-up. I always want to ensure all spirits have been casted out!</p>

<p>I was scheduled to minister to someone from another church on a Friday night early last month, when I request via e-mail asking if I could minister to another sister who has been experiencing extreme migraines and headaches almost on a daily basis. She was also experiencing horrible and frightening nightmares. I was advised that the intercessors at the church has prayed and fasted for her, but to no avail. They want to help this sister, but don't really know what to do now. She has gone to several doctors and to the emergency several times, but nothing has been found. The doctors are continuing their pursuit in diagnosing her problem. (Thank God for doctors! We do need them!) I told her if time permits I would, but it would have to be on Sat, after my scheduled breakfast with their pastor. We met at 9:00 A.M.</p>
<p>As I met with this young sister and the intercessors, she told me that she only starting to experienced these problems when she accepted the Lord less than 2-3 months ago. She also told me that recently she started to experience a migraine when one of the intercessors tried to pray over her. The intercessor told me that it was true and now she's afraid to lay hands on her? (Sounds like one of Satan's tactics, doesn't it?) She also said she felt like giving up on life, she's cannot continue with the migraines. I reaffirmed her that her decision to accept our Lord in her life was the best decision she made, and that the Adversary is creating havoc in her life for doing so.</p>

<p>We initially dialogue for about an hour, obtaining some family background and issues in her life that she's been struggling with. I won't get into the issues specifically, but she repented and forgave. I then told her that I'm going pray over her (without laying my hands on her, I was in another chair), and invite the Holy Spirit and to reveal whatever needs to be revealed. I told her to surrender and cooperate with the Holy Spirit and focus on our Lord. She said she was willing to do so.</p>
<p>I then invited the Holy Spirit and waited upon His presence. Once I felt His presence, she started to gag, placed her hand over her mouth and ran for the bathroom. Upon her return approx 5 minutes later, I asked her if she had vomited. She said. "Yes, she started to feel ill and something started to come up!" I told her that we're on the right track and the Lord has just revealed that there is an unclean spirit(s) in her, and that the Lord is directing us to remove it.</p>
<p>Did I immediately start to cast out the spirit? No.. I now felt to break curses over. I then explained to her what curses are and gave her biblical support of my perspectives, and how they can create stronghold in our lives today. I told her that I wanted to her to repeat after me, and she said she was willing.</p>
<p>In the process, the word "Freemasonry" came to my spirit. I then stopped her and asked her if she knew anyone in her family, past or present that was a Mason, a Demolay, a Rainbow Girl, a Job Daughter, or involved in any related secret society. She said she didn't know. I told her to continue to repeat after me, "I (name) renounce all practices or Freemasonry from my life." When she came to Freemasonry, she went something like Frrrrr... She could not say it! I then commanded all spirits hindering this process to step aside in the name of Jesus. We started again and then she could say it, but strenuously. I had her repeat again and then she could say it without hesitation. (For those of you who minister in this field, try this..have the person you're praying for repeat after you in breaking curses). I was led to do this by the Holy Spirit years ago. I believe this is one of the ways the Holy Spirit reveals to us curses are applicable today and what curses are existing in someone's life.</p>
<p>I then commanded the spirit that Jesus Christ is calling forward to come to attention and reveal yourself. To make a long story short, the spirit of Anger and Fear and their right to inhabit was identified. Both were casted-out. Both spirits were directly related to her issues!</p>
<p>The next morning I did a follow-up phone call because I had to catch my flight back home. The sister who initiated the request for prayer told me that <u>she had the best sleep she ever had in months</u>!</p>
<p>Last night, I received another e-mail saying that <u>she has not gotten a single headache ever since</u> that Sat. Praise God! I was also told in the e-mail she is praising God for everything!</p>

<p><b>*Followup*</b></p>
<p>This afternoon, I had lunch with her and the intercessor who arranged the initial ministry session. I asked her how she's doing (it's been over a month now)? She said <u>she hasn't had a single migraine or headache ever since her deliverance. She also said, " I sleep so good now!"</u></p>
<p>The intercessor (her friend) said she comes to church regularly and just loves the Lord!</p>
<p>I told the intercessor to ensure she continues to receive counseling and mentoring. As I've mentioned in the past, deliverance is only part of the package! Praise the Lord for his love and mercy!</p>

<p>I came with 2 other brothers, our ministry leader Rudy from xxxxxxx (church) and Jimmy from xxxxx Church. We had about 40 inmates (primarily believers) in the Chapel and started to worship. After worshiping for approximately 30 minutes, Rudy spoke for about 5-10 minutes. I then approached the podium and started to talk to the men on the subject of "Curses". About 15-20 minutes into my "unprepared so-called sermon", I felt the anointing of the Holy Spirit come and "electricity" started to flow within by my body. I knew from past experiences he was prompting me to pray for the men. So after rushing thru my sermon, I told them that God loved them, and that I felt the Holy Spirit was going to do something special tonight. I told them that I believed that he was going to break curses off some of them. I then advised them, "For those who are desiring to be set free, to stand..... close your eyes, and repeat after me in prayer". All stood....I then said, "Repeat after me only if it comes from your heart and if you agree with what I'm saying". I started to lead them in prayer by first acknowledging that Jesus is Lord...that he is our Savior and only He can set us free from curses and the strongholds of Satan. I then allowed them a few minutes to personally tell God of their sins and then led them in prayer, asking God's forgiveness for whatever sins they've committed. I then continued leading them by asking God to forgive the sins of their forefathers that has resulted in any generational curses and has come thru their blood-line. (I covered this in my sermon). I told them to ask God's forgiveness for dabbling in the occult or witchcraft.... for seeking another source of power other than God....to seek also God's forgiveness in placing any "idols" in their lives....and so forth....</p>

<p>I then invited the holy spirit to come.......(Rudy told me later, he felt a wave of the Holy Spirit wash thru him at that point). I then asked the Lord to bind all spirits and to "sever" all communications between them. I then asked the Lord by the power of the cross, by the power of his son's precious blood, and by the power of the resurrection to destroy all curses that have been placed upon my brothers before me. I then started to see some of the inmates physically react. One in particular started to have saliva drool from his mouth and his arms started to tremble. I went up to him, laid my hands on him and said, "Spirit, come out!" His entire body started to shake and "bam" down he went, hitting his chair! I asked the Holy Spirit to please continue ministering to my brother. He continued to shake as I left him lying on the carpet. I went to another inmate who was continuing "coughing". I laid my hands on him and commanded all curses to be broken and commanded all unclean spirit to leave in the name of Jesus. He later stopped coughing and told me he felt something lift out of him. I then asked, " Those who feel there is something inside of them and feels like it's stuck or want to come out to raise your hands". About 4 other inmates raised their hands....coughing at the same time...I laid hands on each one and commanded all curses to be broken and all unclean spirits to leave. They all later claimed they felt something leave or had lifted.</p>
<p>I knew we had only about 5 minutes left, so I called up the brother up who went down to tell us what he experienced. Being still in a dazed he said," My body started to feel "weird" as xxxxx (refering to me) was praying...I then started to feel my body shake. When xxxxx came and put his hands on me, I felt my whole body shaking some more and the next thing I knew I was down on the floor! I don't know what happened!" I then asked him how he felt. He said, " I have been struggling with some issues for a long time and now I feels it's no longer there. I feel good and know God did something for me tonight! With "watered and thankful eyes" he shook my hands and gave me a big hug and said, "Thank you, xxxxx!."</p>
<p>The power and love of God is tangible and evident for those who is desiring to know him in a very intimate way. There are some who say, " We should not seek experiences" .....I say seek God, and he will allow you to experience him! I do not hold back when I say.....I do seek God and I do seek to experience him!</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how thankful for God's word and promises. His word says he came to heal ALL diseases. When I started studying "A More Excellent Way" and started applying truth and looking for blocks to healing in my life and went to Pleasant Valley Church in Thomaston, Georgia, I got healed of several diseases listed below through deliverance.</p>
- Asthma - fear of abandonment in my life<br />

- Restless Leg Syndrome<br />
- Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)<br />
- Fibramyalgia<br />
- Back Pain<br />
- Insomnia - because of trauma in the womb, I never hardly slept as a young person. I was sensitive to any noise and would react.<br />
- Anxiety attacks to the point I could not get out of bed for a couple of days at a time.<br />
- Heart Disease (Mitro Valve Prolapse)<br />
- Oppression and Depression<br />
<p>I had done all the traditional stuff such as counseling, behavior modification, medication, inner healing, been in healing lines, seeding faith, and every other way to overcome my problems either physically, spiritually, emotionally, and mentally!</p>

<p>Most of these diseases were rooted in fear. Lots of fear entered in my life because of continual trauma done to me throughout my life as a very young person. I had a curse of destruction on my life that played out almost all my life because of what was in my generations (Occultism and assignments on my life - my grandfather being a mason and grandmother being an eastern star and witchcraft on that side of the family) and also because my parents took me to a clinic to get me help as a young person. They thought I had a learning problem when I was just shut down from trauma from my brother that did many bad things to me because of his Envy and Jealousy. I went to this clinic from age 3 to 5 and while there, this man was a mason and did ritual abuse on me. I was used for child pornography to bring in money into their organization.</p>
<p>When the door points to trauma was dealt with (that brings in fear) and the fear issues were dealt with, through deliverance, my body was able to finally go back to peace and not stay in fight or flight. When our bodies are in fight to flight, then you start getting diseased because of high cortisol levels, and other chemicals over secreting or under secreting like serotonin levels that causes depression, etc. Of course because of the trauma, I had a list of people to forgive in my life. The Spirit of Bitterness or kingdom of Bitterness and its underlings as described in Luke 11:21-26 (unforgiveness, resentment, retaliation, anger, hatred, murder with the tongue) and many other spirits tied into bitterness that was cast out after I took responsibility and forgave them. His word says that if we do not forgive, He will not forgive us so why would he heal us?</p>
<p>There were many dealt with through deliverance that set me free.</p>
<p>Through the teachings at Pleasant Valley, they spend a lot of time teaching to recognize our thoughts, recognizing the enemy and what walkout is. We can expect to be pierced but not broken. People are going to hurt you, and how we respond to them determines if we get pierced or broken. If we immediately forgive or recognize we don't fight against flesh and blood like it says in Ephesians 6:12 and also Paul talks about in Romans 7:17 "Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.", seeing the people that hurt us have sin in them and separate them from their sin then we just only got pierced, but if I choose not to forgive and get offended and allow a root of bitterness to fester, then I got broken.</p>
<p>I'm a whole person today and no longer fragmented and I praise the Lord for it. I no longer have flashbacks or bad dreams or tormented. I cannot thank the Lord enough what he has done for me. After my healing, I went to the professional counselor to have me tested and I was no longer DID. They could not find my parts.</p>
<p>Today I have a ministry and work with all kinds of people that are mentally tormented, people who are DID or have had satantic ritual abuse done to them, to people who have sickness in their bodies. I have the previlaged to see the finger of God heal these people. I give him all the glory.</p>
<p>People perish from lack of knowledge and we have an enemy out to kill, steal and destroy.</p>

<h4>How Deliverage Feels Afterwards</h4>

<p>"...it was one of the coolest things I've ever experienced, and I felt so light and happy afterwards too, like bags of rocks on my shoulders that weighed 50 pounds each were removed. It was so much easier to tell myself "NO" when ever I had the desire to sin..."</p>

<h4>Deliverance from depression, hopelessness, etc.</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Sherri</b></p>
<i>
<p>I grew up in the church - was a very 'good' little christian girl who did all the right things and followed God to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>The church I grew up in was very traditional in many ways and although they occasionally ran in to demons (as christians occasionally will) they didn't have a lot of knowledge of them and dealt with them in the normal, traditional christian manner. (ie just rebuked them)</p>
<p>When I became a member of a charismatic church one of my first experiences of it was a very kind lady who saw a spirit of death on me and invited me to go and see a pastors wife who did deliverence ministry. When they prayed for me I ended up on the floor unable to stand, coughing uncontrollably with something trying to choke me. The whole thing went on for a couple of hours and when I walked out I was free from so much of the depression, hopelessness, despair and inner grief that I had suffered all of my life. They didn't preach to me, they just rebuked stuff and it left.</p>

<p>I went from a church that knew very little about the demonic to contact with christains that not only acknowledged it but were very good at dealing with it.</p>
<p>I can also speak of several close friends who had similar church backgrounds to me who also received great freedom from deliverence ministry.</p>
<p>Jesus went about healing the sick and casting out demons. Not only that but he was doing it in a land of people who followed God. In otherwords he wasn't doing it to people who were witchs or idol worshipers or in whom you would assume there would be any demons. They were just everyday jews who prayed in the synagogues.</p>
<p>I have since had several bouts of deliverence ministry as I had occultic stuff and high level freemasonry in my generational background and every time I got free from more spiritual garbage and received more emotional healing, peace and freedom as a result.</p>

<h4>Asking God to send angels to assist</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>
<p>This was supposed to be a casual phone conversation, and it seems God had other things in mind! </p>

<p>Hot off the press... I just found out that my mother was praying with somebody over the phone earlier today, and when she began to bind the spirits they manifested... she heard this groaning and then dead silence... she finally hung up and tried to call back several times with a busy signal... finally about 10 or 15 minutes later she was able to get back on the phone with the person, and the person had NO idea of what happened... the demon took over in the person and blocked out their conscienceness so they were unaware of what was going on for several minutes... the woman didn't remember a thing!</p>
<p>After the demon manifested, and she was off the phone, and could not call this person back, she notified me about what was going on and we asked God to send down ministering angels to minister to this woman... I believe this is what made the difference during that time when she was unreachable!</p>
<p>My mother noticed quite a change in this person before/after praying with her on the phone, binding up the spirits and commanding them to leave! She said that the first time she talked with her on the phone, she felt something was wrong... but the 2nd time she got her on the phone (after the demon manifested), she was very chipper in personality! The difference in this woman was very evident!</p>
<p>I have seen God's angels at work different times... they are awesome ministering spirits as the Bible says!</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:14, "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"</p>

<h4>Angel protected property from fire</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Mike</b></p>
<i>

<p>A dear church member of mine was out burning trash one day. All of a sudden the wind began to blow wildly. The fire quickly spread and started heading towards her and her neighbor's houses. She rebuked the wind in Jesus' name, then asked that the Lord send an angel to protect their property. The wind stopped blowing and the fire looked as though it was hitting against glass! Then she asked the Lord to send rain to quinch the fire. It rained, in that one spot, without a cloud in the sky! The fire was completely put out.</p>
<p>This dear sain was my piano player and number 1 prayer warrior while I was at that church. Just to let you know, it was a Methodist church!</p>

<h4>Deliverance from hate and bestiality</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Jay</b></p>
<i>
<p>"I'm Hatred" </p>
<p>The demon had revealed his identity and I wanted to know why he had indwelt this man whom I was ministering to. </p>
<p>"I'm here because Jeff wants to kill his boss. He wants to murder him." </p>

<p>"What else are you doing to this man?" </p>
<p>"I'm afflicting Jeff with throat pain," boasted the evil spirit. </p>
<p>Jeff was a hurting individual with some incredible spiritual, emotional, and physical problems. He was living in Las Vegas at that time and wanted deliverance from the demonic torment he had been enduring. He began to browse the internet to find some spiritual assistance for his deep problems. He found our ministry. I arranged a time to meet him and within minutes of our conversation an evil entity manifested.that went by the name of hatred. </p>
<p>"Besides you, Hatred, are there any other spirits inside of Jeff?" </p>
<p>"There are four of us." </p>
<p>Due to Jeff's desire to kill, four spirits of hate entered his body. Each of these spirits were not only tormenting him mentally but was also afflicting him with throat pain. </p>
<p>For hours I dealt with 18 different evil entities within Jeff. After confronting "Hatred" I dealt with a demon that went by the name of "Jealously" and "Remorse." Then I dealt with a demonic spirit that called itself, "Stupidity." </p>
<p>"Stupidity, why are you within Jeff?" </p>
<p>"I'm here because of the sin of gluttony, heresy, and because of Jeff's participation in perverse sexual behavior." </p>

<p>I called Jeff from out of his trance like state and inquired about these sins that the spirit was holding unto. Jeff admitted to overeating, embracing heretical teachings such as Mormonism, and having sexual contact with a cat. Because of these sins evil spirits invaded his life and brought all kinds of physical problems such as colon and skin cancer, moles, and sinus problems. </p>
<p>I demanded to know who else was inside the body. </p>
<p>"Stupidity, who's the next spirit, which God has appointed to judgment?" </p>
<p>"There was a spirit of anger inside of Jeff that exited the body and is already 20 miles away." </p>
<p>This demon named Anger escaped knowing that he would have been next. Demons will attempt to escape detection and the interrogation of an exorcist with the hopes of staying inside the victim. Stupidity also mentioned that the spirit of anger was its way to enter Jeff's father and that another spirit, named "Beelzebub" was about 90 miles away from Jeff with the hopes of entering his body. </p>
<p>I immediately told the spirit to tell Beelzebub to stop under the authority of Jesus Christ. Stupidity confessed that the spirit had stopped and would not be heading Jeff's way. </p>
<p>I called forth the next spirit inside of Jeff. </p>
<p>"I demand the next spirit to come to attention, in the name of Jesus.' </p>

<p>"I'm here." </p>
<p>"What's your name, spirit?" </p>
<p>"I'm Chains and Karma and we are heading towards you, to attack you." </p>
<p>I immediately told the spirit that he would cease from coming near me, due to the fact that I was covered with the blood of Jesus. The demon was stopped from attacking me. I wanted to know the spiritual right the vile spirit had to Jeff. </p>
<p>"Why are you there?" </p>
<p>"Jeff had sexual contact with a cat." </p>
<p>This perverse demon had been tormenting Jeff for years because of the sin of bestiality that he participated in. My wife and I have dealt with many afflicted individuals who got demons through the sin of bestiality. </p>
<p>Jeff received this mercy and truth. I had the high honor of driving the many demons inside of him out. Not only did God deliver him from the many evil spirits tormenting him but God also healed him of the colon and skin cancer, moles, and sinus problems.</p>

<h4>A foolish vow brought a woman under bondage</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>
<p>I don't usually like to post a testimony that is "in the making", but this one shows the reality of how a person's bondages are often traced back to some kind of 'entry point' in their life.</p>
<p>The name and location of this person has been changed to protect their identity.</p>
<p>The other day I was working with somebody who was seeking a deliverance in New York. Mary went to a minister and admitted they were helped to a certain degree, but they seemed to have hit a roadblock. The minister seemed to be puzzled and wasn't sure what to do next. Needless to say, Mary went home still in bondage. She then contacted me through this site, and told me that an experience in her life allowed the demon to enter. I told her that if she was willing to share with me what happened, I would be willing to give her my advice. Come to find out, there was a vow that she made a long time ago. <b>Ever since she made this vow, she has been facing demonic harassment and trouble.</b> This was not a demonic or occult vow, this was simply a vow not to let anybody get close to her ever again. Sure enough, ever since that day she has not been able to be "herself" around others. Not only that, she's had demons harassing her and troubling her in other ways as well. But <b>it all started the day she made that vow</b>!</p>

<p>Now that she understands the root of her problem, she is continuing to seek deliverance. I explained to her how to renounce and break that vow in Jesus' name so that the legal ground would be cleaned up. I explained to her that the next step is to get the demons driven out that took advantage of that 'legal ground'. She is excited that the Lord allowed me to see the root of her problem, and fully understands what needs to be done now. </p>

<h4>Young man harassed by demons</h4>

<p>I was working with a young man who had a list of demonically rooted problems in his life. He too wondered if Christians could have demons. He was hearing voices in his mind about Satan being God, he was being attacked with fears of the unpardonable sin (a very common problem)... he's even had urges to murder others!</p>
<p>After working with him, he told me how almost all of his problems were now in the past!</p>

<h4>Freed from addiction and called to ministry</h4>

<p><b>Posted by Mike</b></p>
<i>
<p>I was called to preach at age 14. I went and told the pastor what God was calling me to do. I figured that I would have to finish High School, go to college, before I preached a sermon. When the pastor told me that his office and library were at my disposal and that he expected me to have a sermon ready in the coming weeks, I was scared silly! I began running from God. I could no longer attend church. Every time I went, I was under such conviction that I couldn't stand it! So, I ran. I began to drink, heavily, to drown out the conviction. I ran for 10 years. By the time I was 24, I was a full blown alcoholic. I was demonized by a demon of addiction. At age 24 I could run no more. I fell to my knees and cried out to God! I told the Lord that I knew that I had messed up my life. If He would clean me up, that I'd go where He wanted and do whatever He wanted. Before I said, "Amen", the demon of addiction was gone! From that day on, I've had no desire to drink! God had set me free! I didn't realize I had a demon until years later. After all, I was a good Southern Baptist, and we didn't have demons.</p>
<p>I surrendered to the Gospel Ministry in 1984. I grew up in the Southern Baptist Denomination. I was on staff, or pastored Baptist Churches until 1996. In 1996 I switched to the United Methodist Church. I was a Methodist pastor until 2003. From 2003 to present I have been in a non-denominational Pentecostal Church. Why so many denominations? Well, when I was in college I had an encounter with a demon. However, Southern Baptists do not have demons! So, there was a problem with me being confronted by a demon. Friends and co-workers tried to convince me it was my imagination. By 1996, I'd had enough of the constant fights over Spiritual gifts and the reality of demons. I was too "pentecostal" for the Baptist Church. A Methodist pastor, friend of mine, asked me to check out the United Methodist Church. He told me that they were more accepting of Spiritual gifts and the reality of demons. In 1996 I began pastoring Methodist Churches. Things were great until I received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit in 1998. The Spiritual gifts that had been operating in me were increased, greatly! Soon, I began to have the same type of disagreements with the Methodist Church that I had with the Baptist Church. In 2003 I left the Methodist Church and began ministry in the Non-Denominational Pentecostal Church. That, in short, is how I arrived at my destination.</p>

<h4>My own testimony</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>
<p>I would like to give a brief story of my testimony. This was written a while ago, but is still a great picture of what God has done!</p>
<p><b><font color='red'>Disclaimer:</font></b> If you are under the age 14, I advise you not to read this testimony. It includes some heavy duty and very real demonic stories! </p>
<p><b>A relationship beyond comprehension and experiences beyond words... </b></p>
<p>I was raised up in a very wonderful Godly home and separated from the world... I had few 'friends'... which was a good thing... but I do know this... I was baptized in the Holy Spirit about age 4 or 5, and had a love in my heart for God that was virtually un-quenchable... I would spend hours on end in God's presence... I remember night after night where I would stay up extremely late... sometimes until 6am... soaking up God's love and presence... I would turn on worship music, hymns, etc. and just weep in God's presence... I have been to various Benny Hinn crusades and been touched so deeply I could never describe it in words... a couple/few years back I was in one, and during the song Alleluia (my favorite song)... I balled to the top of my lungs in tongues, and the person (whom I knew) was next to me, and her ears were 10 inches away from my mouth and she didn't hear a THING! I remember countless times when I couldn't turn on an anointed worship song or hymn without crying... I had a love relationship with God that was 2nd to none... I remember myself telling Jesus that He's ALL I'm living for... and I meant it with every fiber of my being! I remember seeing angels, different times as little flickers of light... one time I even saw one very bold a physically moving before my eyes one night while in prayer.... it was the brightest white I've ever seen!! I feel like the most blessed person alive... I had a love relationship with God that would shake mountains... It was not uncommon for me to start thinking about him and cry, it was so awesome! Different times I have felt balls or waves of heat come at me when spending time with God. Other times I have felt a blanket of heavenly presence fall upon me as I was worshiping the Lord. One of the times I was so deep in God's presence and love during worship, I begged Him to use me to help the people who are down and out in this world... those people who are reallllllly hurting... I believe that was one of the factors that launched me towards the deliverance ministry! </p>
<p><b>From the heights of heaven to the pits of hell </b></p>
<p>Even though I was raised in a great Christian home, one day I did something that opened the door to the demonic (I read a short but very demonic natured one page story online out of curiosity)... I believe that because of the powerful and dynamic relationship I had with my heavenly Father, demonic spirits took all the advantage they could of that open door, and I got harassed badly by demon spirits. <b>I've had my body moved on me, I've been through trances, and even an out of body experience (astro projection)!</b> But all of that was <u>nothing</u> compared to the severe demonic mental harassment! I felt a demonic spirit pulling at my mind... some days it got so bad, I felt like I could barely hold on to my mind and will... demon(s) even spoke through me it got so bad... <b>I was losing control!</b> One day I felt like a walking dead man, I was emotionally dead inside, it was awful... I could have seen my closest family and friends murdered before my eyes and not shed a tear (and that was NOT like me at ALL)... it was one of the most wretched feelings... one day it got so bad I physically felt a demon on my chest... the harassment was almost unbearable! When I was down, I was down... you could have turned on the best worship and praise music and I could feel almost like a piece of wood.... emotionally dead inside. </p>
<p>Other very demonic things happened during this time frame, such as one time <u>my mom saw my body walking down the hall and it was NOT me</u>!!!! </p>
<p>One of the most interesting trances I had started with a dream... I dreamed that I walked into a deep (endlessly deep) dark garage with no lights on and the garage door shut behind me... then a wolf came barking and running towards me from back in the garage... and I ran towards the door and pried it up so I could crawl through to get away... (in reality, I was lifting up the back of a couch where I was sleeping), and crawled out about 10" until I hit another wall (in reality this wall was the wall in the room)... I began crawling along the wall to escape... I thought I was in a dream... until I looked up and turned my head to see a desk and a computer.... that was in the room where I was sleeping... <b>I DID NOT WAKE UP</b>... I suddenly realized that I was awake all along, I just came to consciencely realize what was going on... meantime a dog at this person's house was barking like mad in another room (pets are known to sense the demonic presence)... there was no reason for it, because I couldn't have made much noise... and this was far beyond your average dog bark... this animal was freaked out! To be blunt, a demonic spirit took my body and placed it under the couch that I was sleeping on when I was in a trance! </p>
<p>Then one day I got my hands on my first deliverance book... it was like a light at the end of the tunnel! <b>I realized for the first time that Christians could have demons, which explained everything</b> and I knew at that point that I COULD be set free! I continued reading book and book until I devoured many of them... I learned a lot about spiritual warfare and deliverance from some of the leaders in this ministry such as Derek Prince, Frank Hammond, etc. </p>
<p>I sought help from various ministers... most of them weren't helpful... some of them were very nice and well intending, but didn't solve my problem... one minister threw me into a condition worse than I came to them with... I know what 'bad ministering' is all about, because it happened to me... I was scared stiff! </p>
<p>Then I got in touch with an awesome person several hundred miles away... they started praying with me over the phone, and her voice was scrambled as she spoke the prayer... it got worse as we got into the prayer, and eventually her voice was so bad I couldn't make it out... I ask her to repeat it several times with no progress... she stopped and said said that this is a demon causing the problem! I heard her crystal clear while she was saying that, but not the prayer... both before/after that prayer I could hear her just fine... I was planning a trip down to see her so she could help me... then I learned of Pastor James Brandt, which was much closer to me. The moment I got this pastor on the phone, I knew he would be able to help. He glowed from head to toe with the glory of God... it was as if you were talking to Jesus, the way you felt the joy, the peace and the love of Christ all over him! </p>
<p>Meantime, before I saw James, the Lord moved upon me very strongly one night, and I KNEW something was up in the spiritual realm... it started when the demons had been tormenting my mind, and I turned to a piece of paper that had some deliverance prayers a friend sent me (they were self-deliverance prayers)... my eyes were drawn to the middle of the 3 prayers listed, it was about calling upon Jesus as your deliverer... so I prayed the middle one out loud... and that's when I felt something 'kick in' on the spiritual level... I turned on some worship music and began to come into God's presence... I felt my hands begin to tingle... my face took off tingling... and I began to go after the demonic spirit... I rebuked it and commanded it to come out... I felt something happening and braced myself over my desk, and <u>this demonic being came right up my throat and out my mouth</u>... this thing did NOT sound like me at all... afterwards it was like a heavenly breath of fresh air... I felt a BIG step forward in relief! </p>
<p>I then went to see James Brandt... I got in his office and began to shake... the remaining demons were 'bubbling' (as in, very nervous) in me... I felt plenty of confusion when trying to go through some pre-deliverances prayers... when he began rebuking the spirits they took control of my jaw and vibrated it all the way open and shut many times a second... (something I tried to duplicate later on but found <b>physically impossible</b>)... he went about casting the spirits out of me, and I felt demons in my body before they left... I felt them crawl up my body as he took the Bible and moved it up my legs and upper body towards my throat. (There is a lot of power in symbolically representing something like God's Word... just like anointing people with oil as a representation of the Holy Spirit!) After my deliverance, people said that I glowed... and I even looked different! </p>
<p>Needless to say, <b>I left there changed</b>... I can still to this day remember how awesome I felt that day... it was a sunshiny day outside, and it felt like heaven to be able to enjoy it... I was sooooo thankful!!! <b>I left that place glowing</b>!!!!!!! </p>
<p>Since then, Pastor James and I have become great friends in the ministry. I travel down to see him every once in a while, and we can't talk enough when we get hooked up! The Lord is really using his ministry, and I've seen some mighty testimonies come fourth from his church... various ones I've witnessed myself! </p>
<p>Even before my two deliverances, the Lord started to show me with my own eyes where this all makes sense in the Bible. He has also called me into this ministry. Through prophecy He made it crystal clear what I am to be doing... then He confirmed to me that He will make a way for me to preach deliverance to the captives. He has shown me countless things in His Word... many many times it feels like He has opened the flood-gates of heaven upon me... His word comes alive, and He's spoken to me about many things in this ministry... as a result I have written many teachings that have been posted on my other Web site, GreatBibleStudy.com ... He's taken what many know and practice in this ministry, and shown me where those practices are found in the Bible (so much for those who claim that this ministry is "unbiblical"!).... and seeing where these practices are laid out in the Bible builds your faith like nothing else and makes you virtually un-movable! </p>
<p>THANK GOD FOR THE BLOOD THAT JESUS SHED FOR YOU AND I!!!!!! </p>
<p>I shed some wonderful tears of joy and thankfulness while writing this testimony! </p>

<h4>Delivered from incubus by breaking a soul tie<br /><font size='2'>(Incubus is a spirit that sexually visits women)</font></h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>

<p>Yet another woman contacted me who was being visited by incubus (the demon that sexually harasses women). I talked with her about soul ties, and she remembered a soul tie in her past that needed to be broken. She walked through the steps I laid out and the tie was broken in Jesus' name.</p>
<p>This morning she said that it looks like the attacks have stopped... and it's been over two weeks now since she broke the soul tie!</p>

<h4>Delivered from occult spirits</h4>
<p><b>Send in by Thomas</b></p>
<i>
<p>I was in a gospel group For God's Glory, I was introduced to my Pastor through this group. We were discussing the subject of Deliverance. I went the church talked withe Pastor about attending his deliverance service, because of ties with the occult through dealings in Witchcraft, quaja Boards,etc. The power of the Lord manifest itself through the prayers of the assembly in this church. I was delivered of 18 spirits (pawns) plus the Strongman.</p>
<p>I told my wife about what happened and suggested that she attend the service to become delivered from her ties. She of Hispanic background and there was a lot of demonic ties in her past with the linage of her family using cudoranderas for healing purposes.</p>
<p>She didn't belive until the spirits start to come out of her and what really close the picture to this was the Strongman manifest himself and she yelled out in the church. "Pastor the Demon is trying to get back in, but he just went out of the church through the wall, "PRAISE GOD". I've been there working ever since. Conducting Spiritual Warfare. The television industry has created a block to the individual mind of the believer and non-believer that the deliverance ministry is a fake or a facade. And if the demons come out there going to jump from one person to the next and everyone is going to be possessed. "NOT". Once that demonic spirit is bound in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth the control is in your hands, because of the power and authority Jesus has given us. I thank the Lord our father in Heaven for the gift of deliverance and the authority to lay hands and cast out the works of the devil. God Bless you and this Website.</p>

<h4>God gave woman much desired children</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Kim</b></p>
<i>
<p>This isn't a deliverance testimony, but it's a very important one to me, and it's just one of many that I have about the goodness of the Lord. </p>
<p>When I had my first pregnancy, it was a tubal. I was having many complications at the time, and had no idea why. (didn't know about the tubal till later) One night at church, a brother that was preaching told me that God said "it is well". Naturally, I thought oh God, you're going to save my baby. But, that wasn't His will. I miscarried not too long after that. </p>

<p>About a month after I miscarried, I got deathly ill one day while at home by myself. I had no idea what was wrong. One thing though, my body hadn't stopped certain things after the miscarriage that should've stopped right after. I felt like I had a piece of metal in my body from head to toe, and that someone was trying to bend it the opposite way than it should go. </p>
<p>I finally made it to the ER, and there were many pain staking tests done on me, and come to find out, that my miscarried pregnancy had been a tubal, and that one tube had burst, and the poison was running rapidly through my system. I was told it was a wonder I was even able to walk into the hospital. (yes, walked in instead of wheeled in. lol) </p>
<p>I believe that God saved me from having to have an abortion, because He knew that I'd of died first before allowing the drs. to abort my baby. </p>
<p>BUT, that's NOT the testimony. I had to say all of that, to tell the testimony. </p>
<p>About a year later, hubby and I were wanting a baby. The dr. said that I'd only have a 50% chance of ever getting preg. again due to only having one tube. My heart ached so badly for a baby, and my arms ached just as bad, because they were empty. It about killed me to see people in town with a baby, specially the age mine should have been. </p>
<p>I would get prayer ever so often at church, and finally, one day, (can't remember word for word) God had told me that He'd heard my prayers, and that which I'd been praying for, He would bring to pass. </p>
<p>I just "knew" what God meant. I was so excited that I couldn't stand it, but afraid to be too excited too, as I'd had many disappointments over the few yrs. before. </p>
<p>Before I found out that I was pregnant, I was also having to feed horses and cows 2x a day with bales of hay. I would be lifting anywhere from 700-1,000 lbs. of hay a day (ea. bale was about 100 lbs.) to load the truck to feed the animals. </p>
<p>I was about 6 weeks preg. when I found out the news, and had been working doing that lifting every single day before that. (I had to do that work, as it was for rent and utilities, and hubby held down a reg. job during those feeding hrs.) </p>

<p>So, after all of this story telling, my testimony is this. God blessed me with 3 miracles. I had my first child, (oldest son) then, my daughter was born almost exactly 2 years later, and my youngest son was born just 2 days before my oldest son's birthday 4 years later. </p>
<p>My children are all 2 years apart. I always said I wanted children to be close in age, so they could be close to ea. other. God blessed me with 3 beautiful babies, and he blessed me well. </p>
<p>I had to get my tubes tied to keep from getting blessed any more! lolol </p>
<p>I love the Lord with all of my heart, and I don't deserve the goodness He has bestowed upon me. I am so thankful every day for everything He has given me. </p>
<p>God Bless, Kim</p>

<h4>Emotional healing and deliverance</h4>
<p><b>Sent in by Jennifer</b></p>

<p>First, I was so excited when I saw the note "Share your testimony" it says in the Word of God, that they overcome Him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. Amen. When I was a little girl I went to church. I went and remember loving it. I had a tough home life. Dad struggled with Alcoholism and mom was co-dependant and didn't know how to deal with this. Both my parents went to church. But due to the addictions and disfunction in the home, life was aweful. Their was physical abuse and mental abuse. I eventually lost and interest in church and stopped going. I was looking for escape and thought it might be in acohol. I might mention that I was a fatter little girl and had a horrible last name it just gave kids a reason to alienate me and call me names.(enemy!) In no time I was to lost at the age of 17 in an addiction to alcohol. Lost my virginity to a 26 year pushy boy, at the age of 17. Which escalated my drinking and spiral down hill. I did graduate from school, and got a job right after at the local mill with my dad. I used to come to work just wasted. After a few years of that I was 22 and tried cocain for the first time. Then Methamphetamines. I had obviously opened myself up to many things. I was physically sick and emotionally very sick. After over 20 years of torment, I went back to church. At 30 years old I went to an encounters and it was life changing. After deep repentance of my sins, I was one of the first girls up to recieve what-ever it was that God wanted me to have. I was convienced by then that it had to be awesome, and better than anything I'd ever recieved. I was radically delivered! The first thing I felt was love, deep deep love and that I was loved! Forgiveness, and then I heard a woman shout "Spirit of shame, come out in the name of Jesus!" and I felt like a feather and fell. I can remember then seeing many woman praying over me. I remember my body kind of jerking around like their was a fight inside of me, and then finally just complete peace. I sat on a chair in the room for what seemed to be hours, with a smile from ear to ear and couldn't move. My body felt like it was still plugged in. I just couldn't move and didn't. It's been 3 years, last month. I recieved healing emotionally towards my parents, and love them more than I ever have. I love myself too. But most of all my Jesus, my saviour, and my Deliverer! Hallelujah!~</p>

<h4>Spirit behind knee pain... GONE!</h4>

<h4>Demons driven out of young lady</h4>

<p><b>Posted by Robert L.</b></p>
<i>
<p>Recently ran a young lady through a short deliverance... demons manifested, coughed, etc. When I ran a Bible across her and said, "I now cut the cords of bondage with the Word of God", the demons caused sharp pains right where I was rubbing the Bible and cried "OUCH!!!!" and jumped back... evil spirits were cast out and there was a definite change afterwards!!</p>
<p>I might also add that during this short deliverance, a demon spoke out in a foreign voice (clearly not the person) and told me, "DON'T BE SO LOUD" as I was commanding them to come out... I immediately responded by saying, "Who just spoke to me?" and her head went down to avoid looking at me. Afterwards she described what it felt like; she said that even though she was conscience, she felt these words flowing out of her mouth and it's like there was nothing she could do about it. Such happenings are not uncommon in this type of ministry!</p>

<h4>Demons driven out of young lady</h4>
<p><b>Sent in by Jay Bartlett</b></p>
<i>
<p>Dear Friends of Jesus, </p>
<p>I have a wonderful report to send -- Jesus delivered! </p>

<p>As many of you know a young lady from London, England traveled last week to meet my wife and I for prayer -- to find liberation from the evil spirits that have tormented her for years. My heart broke over the life she had lived -- drug abuse, self mutilation, severe abuse, mental torment, Satanism, occult activity, communion with demons, and other evils. Though the evil was immense the grace of God was extended, in a loving manner, to this young lady these past two weeks. </p>
<p>She arrived last Monday to Dallas, on Tuesday she met us for prayer. </p>
<p>For seven straight days the body of Christ battled the forces of darkness in the power of the Holy Spirit. We held nightly prayer / exorcism sessions for this young lady at the beautiful Mt. Olive Free Methodist Church in Dallas. For seven straight days, some of the sessions lasting late into the night, we battled the forces of darkness, each night evil spirits were cast out -- many very powerful spirits that resisted (but not for long as God's power overcame their strength). </p>
<p>The demonic powers would place this young lady in a trance like state and demons spoke out of her, often times in a strange voice unlike hers (some even growled and acted like an animal). Most of the time her eyes had rolled in the back of her head, we saw only the white -- the demon looking at us. </p>
<p>Each night, it seemed as though we were dealing with stronger spirits then the night before but God was merciful and allowed us to minister to this young lady in love as we asked her to repent of the sins that allowed the various evil spirits access to her life. She did and God forgave her. </p>
<p>The evil powers named themselves and gave us the spiritual right they held unto in the lady's life. This allowed us to systematically demolish the various strongholds that the demonic beings that built over the years. Glory to Jesus Christ of Nazareth. </p>
<p>The body of Christ at Mt. Olive Free Methodist Church stood in their Christ given authority and earnestly prayed for this woman's deliverance. For 30 hours, over seven days, we battled and battled. We persevered. But we were not alone -- God's Holy angels arrived to the church and assisted us in battled. Allow me to explain... </p>
<p>Often times the demons would completely knock the young lady to the ground (even cause her to crawl around like an animal at times). In each instance, we commanded the angels to pick her up off the ground and in each instance the angels listened and obeyed our commands. The angels literally, without the aid of any human assistance, picked the body of the lady up off the ground and placing her in a position where we could minister to her. What an awesome display of God's goodness and power! Many angels showed up and one angel actually appeared to the lady in the sanctuary. </p>
<p>The angels assisted in also restraining the demons, binding them, and holding them (as there were a number of times the demons attempted to force the young lady outside of the church). In several instances the demons did cause her to leave the church only for the angels to bring her back in by our commands in the name of Jesus. </p>

<p>What a good God we serve as He allows us to minister alongside His angels for His glory.</p>
<p>Then the finale was a few nights ago. For hours we battled and battled the evil forces that remained. Anointing oil, the Word of God (the sword of the Spirit), holy water, the sacred symbols of the cross, the blood of Christ, and consecrated materials were utilized to drive out the demons. </p>
<p>I also equipped the saints that were present. I wanted them to be a part of the work of the Holy Spirit, so I invited many of them to cast out the demons in the name of Jesus. I gently instructed the saints on how to minister to the young lady and they exercised their faith and their were RESULTS -- evil spirits were cast out of the body in the name of Christ, our eternal God. </p>
<p>One of the saints present was a 10 year old boy who loves Jesus. He commanded two of the demons out. Other saints also participated and more evil spirits were cast out. This isn't about Jay Bartlett -- it's about the body of Christ working together for the glory of God alone. The church was so encouraged and now desires to assist others whom are demonized. </p>
<p>Toward the end of our session the senior pastor and I dealt with the last evil spirit who threatened to kill me. It was an intense war -- but the last evil spirit was driven out. <b>Fifty-seven evil spirits were expelled, sins were renounced, emotional healing took place, and <u>the young lady was instantly healed of various physical aliments</u></b>. </p>
<p>Whew!!!! What a awesome series of meetings we had in Dallas and we are eternally grateful to God for His mercy, goodness, and love that was displayed these last seven days. The young lady feels so much better and is now desiring to serve Jesus with all of her heart!</p>

<h4>Woman set free from a tormenting spirit of fear</h4>
<p><b>Posted by Robert L</b></p>
<i>
<p>Before deliverance, this woman was feeling a presence of fear and actually heard foot steps in the kitchen while trying to sleep! The other day, we cast out a tormenting spirit of fear, and it came out with a loud scream... just as in the Bible...</p>
<p>Acts 8:7, "For unclean spirits, <u>crying with loud voice</u>, came out of many that were possessed with them..."</p>
<p>I spoke with this woman today, and she hasn't had even a HINT of that presence following her around since!</p>
