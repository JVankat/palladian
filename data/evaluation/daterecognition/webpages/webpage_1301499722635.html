            <p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-19400" title="Picture 8" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/09/Picture-8-660x526.png" alt="" width="660" height="526" /></p>
<p>The Obama administration has urged a federal appeals court to allow the government, without a court warrant, to affix GPS devices on suspects&#8217; vehicles to track their every move.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is demanding a federal appeals court rehear a case in which it <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/08/gps-tracking-unconstitutional/">reversed the conviction and life sentence of a cocaine dealer</a> whose vehicle was tracked via GPS for a month, without a court warrant. The authorities then obtained warrants to search and find drugs in the locations where defendant Antoine Jones had travelled.</p>
<p>The administration, in urging the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to reverse a three-judge panel&#8217;s August ruling from the same court, said Monday that Americans should expect no privacy while in public.</p>
<p>&#8220;The panel&#8217;s conclusion that Jones had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the public movements of his Jeep rested on the premise that an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/09/gps.pdf">in the totality of his or her movements in public places</a>, &#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Smith wrote the court in a petition for rehearing.</p>
<p>The case is an important test of privacy rights as GPS devices have become a common tool in crime fighting, and can be affixed to moving vehicles by an officer shooting a dart. Three other circuit courts have already said the authorities do not need a warrant for GPS vehicle tracking, Smith pointed out.</p>
<p><span id="more-19399"></span>The circuit&#8217;s ruling means that, in the District of Columbia area, the authorities need a warrant to install a GPS-tracking device on a vehicle. But in much of the United States, including the West, a warrant is not required. Unless the circuit changes it mind, only the Supreme Court can mandate a uniform rule.</p>
<p>The government said the appellate panel&#8217;s August decision is &#8220;vague and unworkable&#8221; and undermines a law enforcement practice used &#8220;with great frequency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legal dispute centers on a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court decision concerning a tracking beacon affixed to a container, without a court warrant, to follow a motorist to a secluded cabin. The appeals court said that decision did not apply to today&#8217;s GPS monitoring of a suspect, which lasted a month.</p>
<p>The beacon tracked a person, &#8220;from one place to another,&#8221; whereas the GPS device monitored Jones&#8217; &#8220;movements 24 hours a day for 28 days.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government argued Monday that the appellate court&#8217;s decision &#8220;offers no guidance as to when monitoring becomes so efficient or &#8216;prolonged&#8217; as to constitute a search triggering the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The appeals court ruled the case &#8220;illustrates how the sequence of a person&#8217;s movements may reveal more than the individual movements of which it is composed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court said that a person &#8220;who knows all of another&#8217;s travels can deduce whether he is a weekly churchgoer, a heavy drinker, a regular at the gym, an unfaithful husband, an outpatient receiving medical treatment, an associate of particular individuals or political groups &#8212; and not just one such fact about a person, but all such facts.&#8221;</p>

As far as the court not offering guidelines, I think they did.  If you use the device to tail someone from one place to another, it&#8217;s not a search (think probable cause).  But if you use the device to follow someone from one place to multiple places&#8230;when you build a profile of the person&#8217;s movements&#8230;that&#8217;s a search.</p>

Whether its justifiable or not is a matter of the court to decide. This case hinged on the assumption that a lower standard of proof, reasonable suspicion, which doesn&#8217;t require the courts say, was enough to follow this individual indeffinitely. This was 28 days of continuous surveilance. In most jusrisdiction you can only be held for 24 hours on reasonable suspicion, that time frame might be what the court should prescribe as reasonable.</p>

They may need to justify it in terms of spending the manpower. I am guessing the theory here is that placing a GPS is the same as physically following the person.  Thing is, it&#8217;s also legal for private citizens to physically follow someone. It seems to me it ought to be illegal for me to use technology to physically track people, but I can&#8217;t see how they make it legal for law enforcement but not for everyone else.</p>

It may gather applause when it concerns a drug kingpin, but what about cases of mistaken identity where you are the target. If information is tantamount to power, then our government would seem too powerful for any of our good.

I&#8217;m not sure what the warrant requirements are for them to do this, but I doubt that it matters as the Constitution and US Laws only apply to US agencies. If we outsource the tracking to a foreign nation then warrant laws are irrelevant by our current security cooperation agreements.<br />

Attaching something directly to my car is a completely different animal altogether. For one thing just like dcx_2 posted, the GPS doesn&#8217;t shut off when it enters a private place. Just like always the law enforcement entities are just trying to protect us from very nasty bad people, I understand that and respect it&#8230; greatly, but there are ways to abuse any rule or law and ones of this variety can be seriously abused. Besides, if they are trying to track someone by doing this then they damn well have enough time to petition for the court order they need or better yet, have probably cause to just bust the slime right now.

They have no more right to privacy in a public place than I do.  This means if they want privacy in a public place they must have a warrant.  Their actions and the results of their actions must be publicly observable unless they are operating under a warrant.</p>
<p>I fully believe that the Fed has a right to place a “street viewable” GPS unit on my car if my car is left in public place.  This is the same as restaurant putting a pizza coupon on my car or a police officer leaving a parking ticket.  Neither the police officer nor the restaurant employee has the right to hide or act in private as they leave hidden coupons and tickets on my car.</p>
<p>If the Fed wants to place a “private” non-publicly viewable GPS unit on my car while it is in a public place they must have a warrant.  Why is that so hard for them unless they are doing something unlawful. Not wanting to take the time to get a warrent makes them look like the bad guys.</p>
<p>The public should be very concerned about any official that actually believes that the public has no right to privacy in public places but the Fed does have the right to privacy in public places.  Saying it is ok to privately hide a GPS o my car is like saying it is okay for the Fed to crash into my legally parked car and then pull a “hit and run” and hide the fact they damaged my car.</p>
<p>Let’s re-title the article to say what they are really wanting.  “Feds: Protection From The Actions of The Fed Does Not Exist in Public Places.”  They want to be able to crash into your car without any recourse in the name of National Security.</p>

<p>Saying the police can track anyone without a warrant would assume that the person would never drive onto private property, which I&#8217;m sure it did at some point.

Whereas technology and other developments have eroded the traditional privacy protections of the Citizens of the states of the Union as well as citizens of the United States, the following restrictions are hereby placed on the actions of federal and state governments.</p>
<p>A warrant shall be required at every instance to access or acquire any information about a Citizen of a state of the Union or a citizen of the United States unless said information has been placed in the public domain by that citizen. A warrant is required to access [or acquire] a citizen’s information even if it is in the custody of a third party. The use of electronic or other devices including, but not limited to, unmanned aerial vehicles, helicopters, satellites, thermal imaging, GPS, and night vision to track or monitor a citizen shall require a warrant unless in pursuance of a post conviction parole requirement or as a condition of bail. This prohibition does not apply in cases in which law enforcement is in hot pursuit of a person where probable cause exists to believe that person has committed a felony.</p>
<p>No record of physical attributes or biometrics [, which includes but is not limited to fingerprints, face recognition, DNA, palm print, hand geometry, iris recognition, retina scan, bacteria counts and odor or scent] may be taken unless upon conviction of a felony. Fingerprints may be taken only upon conviction of a misdemeanor or felony. [ The above restriction does not prevent the governments from storing or using the biometrics of government employees who are citizens for use as an authentication factor to access computers, networks, secure areas or other similar applications. Upon termination of government employment all such employee biometrics shall be expunged. ]</p>
<p>Biometric samples may be taken from the deceased if the death is directly attributable to a violent crime. Crime victims may volunteer their physical biometrics or other physical media, including that media presumptively belonging to a perpetrator, to the police for purpose of a criminal investigation. Police shall maintain said biometric or other physical media only until such time as the case is closed or the victim rescinds consent.<br />
All warrants obtained under this Amendment shall be served with the sworn statement of probable cause submitted to the court by the officer seeking the warrant. If the warrant and the statement of probable cause are not presented to the citizen who is the target of the search warrant prior to the search being conducted no evidence from the search shall be admitted into evidence in any proceeding and the officer or officers who conducted the search may be sued in their personal capacity in the court of the state in which the violation occurred for a violation of the Citizen’s inalienable rights in the case of a state Citizen or civil rights in the case of a citizen of the United States.</p>
<p>This Amendment makes federal officer and state officers both liable to the judgment of state courts for litigation brought under this provision. The governments are without authority to use any device that intrudes into the consciousness or subconscious of a citizen or alters or captures any information directly or indirectly from the citizen’s brain. The judicial branch is without authority to create judicial exceptions of any kind to this Amendment under any rationale or pretense.</p>

<p>Our legal system is built on a presumption of innocence. It is built on a prerequisite that prosecution must prove guilt. The defendant does not need to prove innocence, just lack of guilt. If someone is using a vehicle to engage in legal activity, whether they are a criminal or not, does using a tether squaree with constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable search and seizure? Is this significantly different than illegal stop and frisk laws? And as will SURELY occur, what recourse does a citizen have if the tether is attached to the WRONG vehicle, and is arrested and detained because the drivers movements violate some probationary restriction on the real criminal? There is no prevailing public interest here that offsets the right of our citizens to be secure and free in their movemments that could not be served by some real old fashioned detective work, like human surveillance.</p>

This will NOT stop at police tagging cars with a gps device. This will move into tracking you with your cell phone, any time the &#8220;Goverment&#8221; wants. Think about this scenario. Theres a fight at a night club, some one gets punched in the face and the perp runs away. Normally the police would do interviews with people and try to find the guy, but good luck with that. Then this gps tracking becomes legal. All they do is ask att show me every one that was around this building from 8-2am with no court order.. Of couse AT&amp;T will work with a mapping company to block all private places from the gps data so only to show the cops public places peoeple went and will gladly do it to make $$$ (or just give authorities a web site to type in any one name or a location to search). at this point the cops call every one in and put them in a line up to be identified but the defendant. Now this case would be fine, the guy should get charged for punching some one. But what happens when this is use to find protesters at a rally, some on cheating with a cops/FBI, CIA etcs wife, see where some woman hangs out to try to hook up with her, see where your x wife is going. It goes on and on. With the government having the ability to Legally track any one while in public, easily with out any court order then our freedom is pretty much gone.</p>

Do they think the federal judges are too incompetent to rule properly?  Or are they engaging in surveillance having nothing to do with law enforcement?  The recent IG report revealing how they illegally monitor protestors without reasonable suspicion answers that question.  Time for some new laws to reign them in.</p>

It&#8217;s under this administration with all the Libs in it that this using GPS to follow people everywhere without a warrant and being the &#8220;people of interest&#8221; being followed are druggies then more than likely they are also Libs since according to demographics most pro-drug people in this country are Lib Dims! Ironically under this administration we are seeing some of the most invasive surge in using technology to invade everyones privacy whether it&#8217;s the cyber strip search at the airport to listening, following and recording everyone and everything whether there is cause or not, while at the same time prohibiting the recording of law enforcement officials while they are arresting someone, even when they are violating that persons rights! There was another group, who were also Socialist, in fact National Socialist, who not long ago purported to be doing these same types of activities for the public safety and security? Of course after they were defeated we found out the real truth?</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-106174" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>To understand the government’s seemingly unending encroachment of control over Americans, it is necessary to learn the underlying jurisdictional basis from which the government is proceeding.</p>
<p>  The Founding Fathers fought to establish a country based upon individual sovereignty and wrote the Declaration of Independence.  The main principle is stated succinctly &#8211; “all men are created equal”.<br />
  The Founding Fathers fought to adopt the Constitution that would establish a government that would uphold the rights of the individual sovereign.<br />
  Which of the Founding Fathers would have run to the nanny State for any kind of insurance or “benefits”.  NOT ONE !!<br />
  Americans now run to the government for Social Security &#8211; the government that had absolutely no nexus with the individual sovereign.  Americans gave away their sovereignty by asking for a nanny State.</p>
<p>  The Constitution only granted the federal government certain enumerated powers, and, due to the principle that “all men are created equal”, only granted the federal government jurisdiction over foreign commerce, interstate commerce, and trade with the Indians (Article I, section 8).  Since the principle of “all men are created equal” is at the base of our government, the Constitution could not grant the federal government any jurisdiction over intrastate commerce &#8211; our individual freedom is based upon that.<br />
  Then we Americans threw our sovereignty away.  How, you ask?  We went running to the federal government for an insurance program and health benefits.<br />
  The federal government had no way to offer any such program to sovereign Americans, since it has absolutely no jurisdiction over the sovereign individual and no jurisdiction over any intrastate commerce, so it created Social Security.  The “Form SS-5” that an applicant uses to apply for a S.S.# is actually a federal employment form.  You gave away all sovereignty by becoming a federal employee &#8211; the “taxpayer”.  “Taxpayer” is a legal term defined at 26 CFR 2.1-1(a)(5) as a member of the Merchant Marine.  At 26 CFR 2.1-1(b) it states that this is the definition of the term as used throughout the Code and the regulations for all calculation of taxes.<br />
  Tell me, which of the Founding Fathers would have gone running to the nanny State for any kind of insurance or benefits?  NOT ONE OF THEM!!  The Founding Fathers fought to set up a country and a government based upon individual sovereignty and we Americans turned around and asked this government for benefits.<br />
  We are all in the Merchant Marine since we applied for a S.S.# and the Merchant Marine is involved in foreign commerce, so now the government is no longer chained down by the limits of the Constitution.<br />
  FICA and the self-employment taxes are U.S. possession taxes (see 26 USC §7655) &#8211; the federal government was granted jurisdiction over its possessions by the Constitution (Article IV, section 3).  The U.S. possessions are treated as foreign countries (see 26 USC §§ 865(i)(3), 872(b)(7), and  2014(g)) &#8211; this is necessary to be within foreign commerce.<br />
  Once the New Deal was done, every federal regulatory agency that exists today was bound to come into being.  Nowadays a lot of people are clamoring for help &#8211; everyone needs something.  Well, the government is just pleased to help you as one of its employees.  But as an employee, you have absolutely no say in where the money will be spent, nor who will receive the benefit.<br />
  All regulatory government is based upon the threat, or even the actual initiation, of force &#8211; something that the federal government can only do under foreign commerce and over its own employees.  Regulatory government is basically a form of Socialism.  Americans cannot fix Socialism by voting.<br />
  The authority granted to the FBI is cited at title 28 U.S.C., “Judiciary and Judicial Procedure”, section 533, “Investigative and other officials; appointment”, where it directs that the FBI is charged with investigating crimes against the United States, protecting the President, protecting the Attorney General, and other matters under the Department of Justice and the Department of State.  The only people over which the FBI has jurisdiction is set out in title 28 U.S.C. section 535, “Investigation of crimes involving Government officials and employees; limitations”, as government officials and employees.  There is no section of law that grants the FBI any investigative jurisdiction over sovereign Americans.  An American has given up all sovereignty when applying for a Social Security number by becoming a federal employee and, therefore, subject to the FBI’s investigative powers.<br />
  Do you really want to restore American sovereignty?  Abolish Social Security, return everyone’s money, with interest, and then you’ll have your sovereignty.  Otherwise, just keep asking the federal government for “benefits”.<br />

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-106180" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Well, once again, in a long string of abuses, usurpations of power, and downright anti-American sentiments issuing from the almighty DoJ (left/right/doesn&#8217;t matter), the apparently believe they are authorized to tell us what our rights are and where we can &#8216;enjoy&#8217; the use of them.  This is all backwards, all wrong.  The federal government exists to protect our rights, not to undermine or threaten them, and have ONLY the powers we grant them, enumerated in the Constitution and further discussed/debated/legislated/interpreted/enforced by the various branches of government.  </p>
<p>The 4th amendment makes it quite clear that we are not to be subject to unreasonable search and seizure, and monitoring someone&#8217;s travel from point A to point B, regardless of whether those endpoints are private or public property, is the very definition of unreasonable.  Authorities are supposed to demonstrate and document the reasonable suspicion behind a search, the places to be searched, the things or persons to be searched/seized, and yet year after year they beg, threaten, wheedle, and intimidate to get out from under these restrictions.  While perhaps making a VERY narrow exception for emergency situations, there is absolutely no reason for authorities to bypass these safeguards, considering they can still get their &#8216;man&#8217; or prove their case using old-fashioned and time-tested investigative techniques.  Is it too much to ask for them to exercise a little creativity and intelligence to prove wrongdoing rather than simply asking for broad authority to watch anyone for any reason with zero accountability and oversight?  Obviously it is.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;re screwed, there is really no way around it.  The only solution at this point is to watch the watchers.  They have no respect for our rights, and haven&#8217;t for a long time. There is no such thing as a law-abiding citizen in this day and age.</p>

Shouldn&#8217;t they be out there on lampposts to watch us where we have no expectation of privacy?  They haven&#8217;t done it primarily because people would lose their minds.

It is amazing just how much of our Civil and Privacy Rights have been revoked or eroded since the bush years and the advent of the P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act. The Obama Administration has shown that it is no better than bush was when it comes to protecting Us, The People, from violations of our Constitutional Right to Privacy. The Government is slowly but surely whittling away at every privacy right we have ever had and is pushing us ever closer to a Totalitarian Police State. It is truly shameful that Obama is not only allowing this to happen but is apparently happily endorsing it. I expected so much more from him instead of just &#8216;more of the same&#8217;, especially since he claimed when he was running for President that he was against these type of abuses of the bush era. Just goes to show that you can NEVER trust what a politician tells you.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-106218" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>We are now entering a technological era when every law can be enforced, all the time, on everyone, anywhere. Even if it&#8217;s a bad law. Even if nobody cares. Even if the only reason someone cares is because your nephew knocked up the police cheif&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p>Many of our laws are vestigial from a time of limited government knowledge, or were designed to do one thing, or were ment for use as a &#8217;spitting on the sidewalk&#8217; defense against people whom they could not prove some other larger crime against, things that can now be proven directly given government omnipresence&#8230;.Or are just plain bad laws, founded in superstition and ignorance, such as the cannabis laws, or for the purpose of enforcing morality that may or may not still resonate.(It is a crime to not open the door for a lady in some places in Texas, it will soon be a crime to not purchase health-care.) These laws still exist, the things they prohibit are still illegal, and people still go to jail/have their lives ruined because they break them.</p>
<p>Combine the simple fact that everyone breaks laws all the time because everything is illegal(I.E. spitting on the sidewalk, not signaling properly to change lanes.) with the fact that our society is one of the most punitive in the world, with longer and harsher prison sentences, longer parole, less discretion in sentencing(Talk to a 19 year old who slept with a 17 year old for an example of overboard penalties);(The most punitive in fact, with more people in jail per person than anywhere in the world. Take that land of the &#8216;free&#8217;.) and you realize that only the good graces of the local cops/government/politicians keeps you out of jail.</p>
<p>When anyone can go to jail at any time for anything, you have a police state, not a rule-of-law state. One where those with more power can act with total impunity toward anyone with less power at any time in any fashion they choose, because they can imprison anyone they wish at any time for some violation of the &#8216;law&#8217; or other. Your only defense is, paradoxically, not to not break the law(that&#8217;s impossible) but to do whatever you have to, legal or not, to stay on the enforcer&#8217;s good sides. It&#8217;s no longer a civil society, it becomes a cut-throat Darwinian land of strong-vs-weak.</p>
<p>Our system was designed on discretion in the application of law and government not being omnipotent. With that social contract broken both ways around, tyranny will soon follow.</p>
<p>Other societies have maintained one or the other social contracts, and are therefore still civil societies, or have made concentrated efforts that we have not to reduce the number of laws applying to commonsensical ones. Or are just more tolerant and less punitive.</p>
<p>Once civil society is lost, it can not be regained. This country is doomed to a Darwinian struggle between the rich and the not-so-rich with winner take all and the losers in jail.</p>
<p>Get out while you can.</p>
