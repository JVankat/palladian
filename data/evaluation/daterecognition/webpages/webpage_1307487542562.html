<P>At first glance, the reader might assume that this report should be classed
under religion.&quot; By the time the concluding paragraphs have been reached,
that reader should nod in agreement with our decision to present this under the
departmental heading of &quot;Strategy.&quot; To make the connections needed to
make the strategic issues clear to the reader, I must deal with closely related
problems of religious belief itself. This requires that we give significant
attention to certain religious matters here, a subject on which the relatively
greatest number tend toward extremely impassioned opinions, but, perilously,
little actual knowledge. </P>
<P><A NAME="b1">This report is in response</A> to extremely important
strategic issues referenced by Josef Cardinal Ratzinger's June 9 statement on
the behavior of certain Protestant cults. [See box.] The statement is not merely
factually accurate, but addresses a matter of highest strategic concern.
<A HREF="#n1"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 1 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> When one
takes into account the spread of the same corruption into the Catholic Church,
which is illustrated by, for example, the case of Michael Novak, the problem
identified by that distinguished Cardinal poses an issue which should be of
utmost concern to the patriots of every civilized nation today. </P>
<P>From the standpoint of history, epistemology, and statecraft, the pervasive,
essential issue is clear. Contrary to the minority opinion expressed by Thomas
Jefferson in his time, the issue raised by the Cardinal, is essentially the
invasion of religion by reactionary politics. Unfortunately, virtually all
efforts to discuss such connections end up in a swamp of conflicting bigotries,
popularized sophistries, and similar confusion. The pathways customarily,
foolishly selected for discussion on this topic, lead through a swamp of
muddleheadedness. Few travellers survive the nightmare-journey through that
swamp, minds intact, to arrive at the point of taking the essential issue
directly into account. The only effective way to address the issue, is to take a
short-cut through the high road, avoiding the swamps of popular theology which
lie below. I must take direct aim at the <B><I>political</I></B> essence of
the matter, as no churchman is prone to do publicly, but as I do here. </P>
<P><A NAME="b2">Approach the underlying issue</A> <A NAME="b3">in the most
direct</A> and efficient way. Begin with those most soiled aspects of organized
religious confessions, which are typified by the case of &quot;low church&quot;
televangelist &quot;Diamond Pat&quot; Robertson. <A HREF="#n2"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 2 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> I refer to those &quot;Elmer
Gantrys,&quot; by means of whom so-called &quot;high church&quot; channels are
used by intelligence agencies, to coordinate the politically motivated
proliferation and deployment of missionary and other charismatic cults operating
under &quot;low church&quot; cover. Former Vice-President, and President George
Bush's 1981-1992 network of military-based &quot;Quangos,&quot; typifies the
intelligence operations engaged in such practices. <A HREF="#n3"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 3 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> To understand the empirical
reality of the Cardinal's categorical charges, the most efficient approach is to
target those operations in which Catholic organizations are sometimes morally
corrupted by their &quot;ecumenical&quot; interface with Protestant
organizations operating under British or other intelligence services' direction.
</P>
<P>Observe certain of ex-President Bush's more shameless, recent money-grubbing
deployments to the dark side of the Moon. This shows clearly the immediate, and
monstrous threat to the welfare of the population of entire nations below our
Rio Grande border, and elsewhere. We see &quot;Diamond Pat&quot; Robertson
consorting with the same coven of backers of a holocaust of genocide in Africa,
the which is also backed personally by ex-President Bush. Bush's and similar
meddling in religious covers for irregular-warfare operations against the people
of friendly nations, is also a threat to the United States itself. There have
been numerous phenomena of a similar type during the recent five centuries of
European civilization's history. This present, new &quot;Babylonian captivity&quot;
of religion, has become, during the recent thirty years, the gravest strategic
threat to civilization as a whole since the nightmare known as the
Fourteenth-Century New Dark Age. </P>
<P>To show such heavily tainted connections, one might choose nominal Catholics
such as U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, or Michael Novak.
For the case at hand, Novak is the appropriate case to illustrate the way in
which the political corruption referenced by Ratzinger works.             </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>The singular grammar of reason</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is readily documented, that the political and philosophical views on
religious subjects which I represent here, are those long-standing, Leibnizian,
ecumenical premises of the philosophical association which I have headed since
its inception. Nonetheless, I must write in the first person singular. I do not
do this as a concession to the relatively tiny handfuls of my associates who
have differences with my views on some related matters. I do this, because the
power of Reason is not a collective quality, but one which exists only within
the sovereign precincts of the individual person's cognitive powers for
generating experimentally validatable, original discoveries of universal
principle. </P>
<P>I proceed now, by lingering here long enough to explain the relevant issue
of method obliging me to resort, in this case, to utterance in the first person
singular. </P>
<P>Serious religion addresses directly the most profound issues of earthly
principle, respecting the nature of the individual person, of mankind, man's
relationship to nature, and the nature of relations among persons occasioned by
mankind's relationship to nature. Actual communication respecting the content of
matters of principle, can not be made by mere choice of words, never by literal
interpretations of text. Interpretation of text is feasible, and often
important. However, contrary to disciples of France's and George Soros's satanic
Jacques Derrida, text can not speak for itself. Respecting the most important
classes of matters, such as the <B><I>New Testament</I></B>, or Chapter I of
<B><I>Genesis</I></B>, as also relative to Classical art, or to science, the
most moronic of all religious cults are those which rely upon &quot;dictionary
nominalism.&quot; To arrive at a correct interpretation, one must rely on
something higher, the which no dictionary, no grammar can supply to mere words.
</P>
<P><A NAME="b4">Contrary to the late Professor </A>Norbert Wiener, and his
younger, positivist sibling, the late John von Neumann, <A HREF="#n4"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 4 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
<B><I>ideas</I></B> are not merely linear constructs, which might be
generated, or anatomized, by tinker-toy games with vocabularies, grammars,
algebra, or statistics. <B><I>Ideas</I></B> are discovered principles of the
universe. Such ideas are generated through resolution of those kinds of
paradoxes which shatter faith in the monkey-gods of simple sense-certainty. </P>
<P>These discoveries can be made only through the sovereign cognitive processes
internal to the individual mind. These ideas are proven, or disproven, by
reliance on that kind of experimental method developed by Plato and his
followers, the method which Cardinal Nicolaus of Cusa presented to launch modern
experimental physics, through writings including his <B><I>De docta ignorantia</I></B>.
</P>
<P><A NAME="b5">This is the method of</A> <A NAME="b6">discovery of
principle.</A> It is the method relied upon by a famous student of Cusa's
writings, Leonardo da Vinci. It is the method which Johannes Kepler learned from
Cusa, Luca Pacioli, and da Vinci. It is the method of Gottfried Leibniz, as
expressed through the successive discoveries of Carl Gauss and Bernhard Riemann.
It is the method which I learned, in adolescence, from Leibniz, <A HREF="#n5"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 5 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> and, later in life, from Riemann's
work. <A HREF="#n6"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 6 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> 
Although one mind can not communicate an idea to another in a simply direct,
literal way, those who have experienced the relevant paradoxes and their
experimentally validatable solutions, have very efficient, indirect methods, by
means of which to communicate <B><I>ideas</I></B> located within the
impenetrably sovereign, inner processes of one's own mind, to the inner
processes of another's. Contrary to &quot;information theory,&quot; this
communication is accomplished through the implications of what Leibniz
identified as <B><I>Analysis Situs</I></B>. It is accomplished, through
sharing, as if in parallel, both the replicatable act of discovery which
resolves a devastating paradox, and, also, the notion of the
crucial-experimental validation of that discovery. </P>
<P><A NAME="b7">This Socratic method for communicating </A><B><I>ideas</I></B>,
as Plato defined <B><I>ideas</I></B>, is the correlative of the <B><I>idea</I></B>
of
<B><I>Reason</I></B>. This is &quot;Reason&quot; as it lies at the center of
Christian belief. This is the rigorous premise for Christian opposition to such
charismatic nightmares as Pentecostalism. This same notion of &quot;Reason,&quot;
is the basis for the Christian rejection of that notion of the &quot;elect,&quot;
which Calvin borrowed from the Bogomil influence upon his Rhone region.
Similarly, it is central to Christian condemnation of those notions of
justification by the marketplace, which are at the center of what I shall
demonstrate to be the irrationalist, charismatic religious beliefs of such as
Michael Novak today. <A HREF="#n7"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 7 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
</P>
<P>To address, here, those axiomatically political issues which underlie all
important issues of religion, as also the pagan form of irrationalist religious
beliefs upon which atheism is premised, we must rely upon Reason. We must,
reader and writer, enter into a compact, to communicate by methods consistent
with the principle of Reason. We must reject the hesychastic, the contemplative,
or so-called &quot;objective&quot; forms of communication. What is said here, in
the interest and practice of Reason, is strictly from me, to thee. </P>
<P>Once we understand that political misuse of religion, which Ratzinger
denounces in his referenced remarks, and, we understand that from the standpoint
I represent here, the secrets of <B><I>all</I></B> politics are open for you
to discover.              </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>What do Christians believe?</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Implicitly, <B><I>most</I></B> among those problems against which Cardinal
Ratzinger complained implicitly in that address, appear to refer to the known
role of charismatics, including Pentecostalists, in targetting members of the
Catholic confession. We should be familiar with this pattern from recent decades
in Central America. To understand the nature of the conflict so presented, it is
essential to clarify the manner in which Christianity deals with such
charismatic phenomena as reports of visions, other forms of miracles, special
prophecy, and wild-eyed varieties of so-called &quot;literal interpretations of
Scripture.&quot; </P>
<P>In Christianity, our obligation to speak truthfully, obliges us to say
nothing, with respect to religion, politics, science, or art, which we do not
<B><I>know</I></B> to be true. Thus, truthful people never base their opinions
upon reports of alleged fact circulated by the popular news and entertainment
media, or other habitually malicious gossips. Similarly, if someone insists that
they have &quot;seen the Virgin,&quot; &quot;heard the voice of prophecy,&quot;
or witnessed a miracle, we must be vigilantly doubtful, since we can not accept
<B><I>their</I></B> impassioned, apparent sincerity as <B><I>our</I></B>
belief. We may be unable to identify any evidence internal to their report which
could show us that the claim is intrinsically false, but we still must not
embrace their claim as our belief. Truthful persons never succumb to mere
opinions (especially popular opinions); truthful people profess only what they
know. </P>
<P>Nor, can we rely upon the senses, neither those of presumed eye-witnesses,
nor our own. Even if one among us were such a witness, we could not rely simply
on the corroborated evidence of our senses in such a matter. Yet, since the <B><I>New
Testament</I></B> reports miracles, the Christian will not reject out-of-hand
the possibility that a miracle might occur some place, some time. There are
scientific premises, which warn us that such things are possible in the universe
as it is known to be constituted. </P>
<P>The Christian has principally two resources for dealing reasonably with such
matters. </P>
<P><A NAME="b8">For reasons I shall supply</A>, Christianity <B><I>knows</I></B>,
as a matter of Reason, not mere opinion, that God is a Christian. God is a
Christian, whose nature is identified by that notion of <B><I>agape</I></B>
which subsumes the Gospel According to St. John, and such other works as, most
notably, <B><I>I Corinthians</I></B> 13. To restate Leibniz's principle, that
this is the best of all possible universes: Once one has, like Kepler, grasped
how the lawful composition of the universe is ordered, one <B><I>knows</I></B>,
with the highest possible order of certainty, that no action attributable to the
Creator of this universe, could lack the characteristic of <B><I>agape</I></B>.
<A HREF="#n8"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 8 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> Any
claims respecting visions, miracles, and so forth, which are not coherent with
<B><I>agape</I></B>, are to be relegated immediately to the category of either
willful hoaxes, psychopathologies, or, something worse, with no additional
evidence then required to support such a general conclusion. </P>
<P>The Christian's second resource, is science, although not the empiricist
perversion portrayed in today's generally accepted classroom and textbook. The
Christian has resort to the experimental method of Cusa, da Vinci, Kepler,
Leibniz, Gauss, and Riemann. </P>
<P>If we reject the notion of self-evidence of sense-impressions, how do we
<B><I>know</I></B> anything? How does Christianity, as an institution, <B><I>know</I></B>
something which it might transmit to individual living persons, not merely as
instruction, but as knowledge? To wit: </P>
<P>All true human knowledge is, in fact, a miracle, and that in the strictest
usage of the term. Situate what I have said in earlier locations, on the formal
side of scientific and artistic creativity, in the specific setting of our
discussion of miracles. This involves a principle first known through the work
of Plato, but more richly understood since the most crucial advances in
scientific method, successively, by Gauss and Riemann. </P>
<P>This involves a principle, in which my special expertise is not only
outstanding, but, presently, regrettably, rare. For that special degree of
competence, I am chiefly indebted to the principal mentor of my adolescent
development, Gottfried Leibniz, and, to the consequent, original discoveries, in
the domain of physical economy, to which I was led, under his continuing
influence, approximately a decade later. The coin of my economics expertise, is
making comprehensible the functional relationship between cognition and that
expression of man's dominion of nature, the which is to be recognized as
increase in the general, physical-economic, productive powers of labor.
Consistent with Leibniz's view of physical economy, but in a qualitatively more
advanced way, I was able to expose the connection between the way in which <B><I>agape</I></B>
governs, explicitly, the generation of validatable discoveries of principle in
both physical science and also, in the same sense, in Classical forms of both
plastic and non-plastic art. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, the originality of my accomplishments in this regard, burdens
me with the duty to repeat myself, whenever this specific implication of my
discoveries is essential to rendering a subject-matter comprehensible. So it is
in this location. The question which must be resolved, before focussing upon the
relevant strategic conclusions, is not simply &quot;What do Christians believe?&quot;
Rather, the question is, &quot;Of that which various Christians assert
themselves to believe, what portion do they actually know?&quot; </P>
<P>Take a case in point. If a student in a theology class were to ask a
qualified scientist, what is to be understood by the report, that man and woman
are made in the image of God, how could the scientist show that student how to
discover the answer for himself, as a matter of validated knowledge, rather than
mere opinion? What does a scientist know of such matters, which a theologian
whose mind-set is that of a student of modern sociology, would almost certainly
not be capable of demonstrating? </P>
<P>The subject scientist, were he competently defined as such, would have based
the development of his personal moral character upon reexperiencing an extended,
chiefly historical series of original, validated discoveries of principle. In
the main, each such discovery would have been a replication of the mental act of
discovery by an original thinker who lived as much as thousands of years
earlier. </P>
<P>If he were a good scientist, he would also be habituated to Classical
art-forms (rather than &quot;popular&quot; or Romantic forms). He would consider
his participation in such art-forms, as morally indispensable to fostering his
fruitfulness as a scientist and teacher. The interdependency of science with the
Classical art-forms, is too little understood, but no less crucial for that
reason. For reasons developed by Plato, and also others, without training and
participation in Classical art-forms, there can be no true literacy in the
practice of science, or theology. </P>
<P>He would show, by aid of examples from his own experience in replicating
validated, original discoveries of principle, that the human individual has a
special nature, not found among the beasts. This nature is expressed as the
ability to modify not only one's own behavior, but that of entire cultures,
through the generation and assimilation of validated, original discoveries of
universal principle. This creative power of cognition, is the empirical
demonstration of the one quality of the human individual, which is special. It
is the only thing we know of human behavior which could possibly correspond to
the notion of man and woman made in the image of the Composer of this universe.
</P>
<P>The crux of that matter, is the fact, that through the accretion of such
discoveries, and their transmission by cognitive replication, mankind increases
its power over the universe. Since <B><I>Genesis</I></B> 1:26-28 correlates
man in the image of God, with increase of dominion over nature, the scientist's
view, so described, represents true <B><I>knowledge</I></B> of the meaning of
these passages of <B><I>Genesis</I></B> 1, rather than mere doctrine or
opinion. </P>
<P>Knowledge is not a matter of deductive consistency among mere words. Words,
indeed, have no intrinsic meaning; every attempt to arrive at a simply literal
meaning of the Biblical text, is, therefore, a hoax from the outset. One must
reexperience the relevant cognitive processes of the author, and validate the
indicated discovery of an idea by the appropriate experimental method. Only when
we can personally validate, or invalidate an idea attributed to an author, do we
<B><I>know</I></B> both a meaning of the text, and the validity, or invalidity
of that putative meaning. </P>
<P><A NAME="b9">There is an additional facet to</A> that specific knowledge:
the matter of the empirical validation of the idea of <B><I>agape</I></B>, as
that term is employed by Plato, and, with the same meaning, later, by the
Apostle Paul. <A HREF="#n9"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 9 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
A brief review of the principles of scientific discovery of principle, is
required at this juncture. </P>
<P>In all of modern civilization, the discovery of a new principle arises as
the resolution of a devastating paradox of the ontological form typified by that
of Plato's <B><I>Parmenides</I></B>. </P>
<P>On the one side, we have the systematic belief which, up to that point, has
satisfied our available tests for truthfulness. However, we are, at the same
time, confronted by evidence whose reality we must accept, by the same standard
we accept our established belief. This is evidence which could not exist within
the bounds of the universe as these were defined by our previously established
system of beliefs. </P>
<P>The attempt to juxtapose these two distinct, immiscible pieces of past and
new evidence, creates a devastating form of scientific-epistemological paradox.
I have come to prefer the estimate for the Earth's meridian, provided by the
experimental method of Eratosthenes, as the pedagogically suitable example of
discovery of principle, as otherwise expressed by the treatment of curvature in
the leading work of Carl Gauss and Bernhard Riemann. In Classical forms of art,
the same kind of paradox is known as metaphor. I have insisted that, to
understand science, we must recognize paradoxes of this form, as expressions of
the same type of problem represented by true metaphor within the domains of
Classical forms of poetry, tragedy, music, and of plastic art such as that of
Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael Sanzio. </P>
<P><A NAME="b10">Initially, such paradoxes confront the</A> mind with the
awesome vastness of the unknown. On principle, no deductive-inductive method
could provide a solution for such metaphors. The objective of the thinker caught
in such a maelstrom, is twofold. First, he must resolve the confusion in a
manner which is prohibited by the empiricists, Immanuel Kant, and the
positivists. He must generate a tentative new principle of knowledge respecting
the universe. Second, he must devise an experiment which demonstrates, or
refutes the efficient presence of that principle in nature. The result of an
experimentally validated discovery of principle, of this sort, as Riemann was
the first to put this problem in a comprehensible form, is a sweeping
reconstruction of the preestablished, general hypothesis, by a new such
hypothesis. This new hypothesis then underlies the new way in which we select
and construct those propositions which the hypothesis will, in the future,
permit us to select as theorems.<A HREF="#n10"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 10
]</NOBR></FONT></B></A></P>
<P>In Classical art, as typified by Wolfgang Mozart's discovery of a new
general principle for motivic thorough-composition in music, all great art
expresses the exact same principle I have just described for validated
fundamental discoveries of principle in physical science. </P>
<P>Once that referenced maelstrom confronts any among us, the effort to
extricate our thoughts from that difficult situation centers around the issue of
&quot;thought-energy.&quot; </P>
<P>In such a fix, we are comparable to the mountain-climber, who requires the
conviction, clarity of mind, and raw energy, to continue the ascent past
yet-to-be-defined next obstacles, not only obstacles presented by the mountain,
and, those sudden changes in weather conditions which are to be expected in
upper portions of the ascent, but, above all, climbers must be prepared to deal
with the moral obstacles which might erupt, unexpectedly, from within ourselves.
The two great problems which we may observe to haunt most climbers, in that or
analogous circumstances, come from within themselves, problems related to the
celebrated General Carl von Clausewitz's special usage of the German term <B><I>Entschlossenheit</I></B>
for similar problems arising within the embattled military commander. The two
enemies are foolhardiness (e.g., &quot;flight forward&quot;: &quot;to get it
over with&quot;), and the kind of moral exhaustion of the intellect which impels
the victim to &quot;give it up.&quot; Both latter pathologies, can be subsumed
under the notion of lack of relevant quality of &quot;thought-energy.&quot; </P>
<P>The solution to this &quot;mountain-climber's&quot; challenge of a true
metaphor, is that passion for truth, even for the kind of revolutionary truth
which overturns entire doctrines, the which is called <B><I>agape</I></B>. The
ability to sustain the mental energy, to concentrate, with increasing
resolving-power, on a metaphor, to the effect of making the required, creative
breakthrough which solves the paradox, is <B><I>agape</I></B>. The two typical
problems of the aberrant mountain-climber, we have referenced just above, may be
reduced to an elementary type, by describing them as pathologies which afflict,
and disrupt cognitive processes, when <B><I>agape</I></B>, as source of &quot;mental
energy,&quot; is lacking. </P>
<P>Consider the Classical-humanist form of education, such as that fostered by
the Brothers of the Common Life. The student is not instructed what to believe;
he is, rather, confronted with the challenge of discovering the principle which
demonstrably solves the paradox. This must not be the merely apparent solution
situated within the virtual-reality domain of formalism; it must be a solution
within the reality of the actual universe. The student is subjected to a
step-by-step process of meeting successive paradoxes of the sort referenced. In
this experience, that student comes to recognize the presence of <B><I>agape</I></B>.
<B><I>Agape</I></B> appears to him, or, to her, as a distinguishable presence,
which lifts the thinker over each great obstacle posed by successive paradoxes.
Through repeated replications of validated great discoveries, made originally,
chiefly, by persons long deceased, the student becomes familiar with the
presence of <B><I>agape</I></B> in this expression. </P>
<P>That student's reliance upon that agapic method for assimilating the
accumulation of discoveries of principle from thousands of preceding years,
depicts the Classical humanist form of education, through which the development
of the moral character of the pupil is accomplished. This is in contrast to the
morally degenerate modes of education, such as those introduced by John Dewey,
et al., for general use in the U.S.A. during the present century to date. </P>
<P><A NAME="b11">We could prove, from many clear</A> <A NAME="b12">examples,
that</A> every good scientist, such as Leibniz, Lazare Carnot, and Louis
Pasteur, has understood this principle. In Leibniz, this shows, for example, in
respect to his religious belief. In the anti-Newtonian tradition of Lazare
Carnot, Gaspard Monge, and Louis Pasteur, the French expression of the role of
<B><I>agape</I></B> in science, is <B><I>enthusiasm</I></B>.<A HREF="#n11"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 11 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> Under Lazare Carnot and Gaspard
Monge, the educational method of the 1794-1814
<B><I>Ecole Polytechnique</I></B> was governed by this same Classical humanist
principle of the Brothers of the Common Life, as employed also by the French
Oratorian teaching-order, which had educated Monge and Carnot, and for which the
<B><I>Ecole Polytechnique</I></B> was a continuation.<A HREF="#n12"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 12 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="b13">This is explicit in all forms of</A> great Classical art. As
in the best known of William Shakespeare's tragedies, <B><I>Hamlet</I></B>,
the metaphor which pervades the entirety of the drama, as highlighted by the
celebrated Third Act soliloquy, &quot;To be, or <B><I>not to be</I></B>,&quot;
requires the audience to resolve the paradox. This is as Friedrich Schiller
describes the function of tragedy, to transform audiences into better people
leaving the theater, than entering it. <B><I>Agape</I></B> is the subject of
all great Classical art; thus, the Christian has a natural inclination for
Classical art-forms, abhorring the banality of those forms of art which avoid
<B><I>agape</I></B>, and are therefore, <B><I>erotic</I></B>, rather than
<B><I>agapic</I></B>. To the replacement of Classical music by Romanticism, or
by more vulgar expressions of mass musical entertainment, such as the frankly
satanic rhythms of &quot;rock,&quot; the Christian says, &quot;With this, I
disagree absolutely.&quot;<A HREF="#n13"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 13 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="b14">Writing on these matters from</A> <A NAME="b15">the
standpoint of the history </A>of the United States, there are two nodal points
of British ideological fungus in the history of the northeastern U.S.A., which
have gained special, world-wide relevance respecting the current issues
referenced by the Cardinal's statement. The first, is the neo-Kantian mysticism
kown as &quot;Concord Transcendentalism,&quot; of such as Ralph Waldo Emerson,
and Henry David Thoreau. The second is the spread of the so-called &quot;American
Pragmatism&quot; of Harvard University's Professor William James. Just as the
first, &quot;Concord Transcendentalism,&quot; was an outcrop of the British
Foreign Service's &quot;Young America&quot; subversion, the second reflected the
British influences typified by Hermann Helmholtz and mid-Nineteenth-Century
German neo-Kantianism. At bottom, in his work on the subject of psychology and
in matters of religion, James was a runt of the American political litter,
essentially a rabidly Tory throw-back to the early Eighteenth Century's satanic
figure, Bernard Mandeville.<A HREF="#n14"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 14 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
In all of James' work flowing into his general dogma of pragmatism, he was a
follower of the modern Manicheanism of Mandeville, in the same sense that

fraudulent imposition of the dogma of Thomas Malthus upon the reading of nature.<A

</P>
<P>For the purposes implicit in Cardinal Ratzinger's statement, the highly
relevant aspect of William James' activity, is several among his published
writings, beginning with a series of essays dating from a hundred years ago,
under the title of <B><I>The Will to Believe</I></B>. The latter was
succeeded, in 1902, by a nasty work which has become a generally standard text
of instruction for future Catholic and other clergy in U.S. divinity and
theological departments of colleges and universities, <B><I>The Varieties of
Religious Experience</I></B>. This in turn, was superseded by a series of
lectures, published as <B><I>A Pluralistic Universe</I></B> in 1909, setting
forth that anti-rational doctrine which has become the secular religious dogma
of the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL's) and International Republican Institute's
(IRI's) asset, today's U.S. National Endowment for Democracy (NED). </P>
<P><A NAME="b16">From the beginning of this century</A>, the American
pragmatism of James and John Dewey, was promoted by the Rockefeller family and
others, into relatively dominant positions within philosophy, divinity,
theology, and education departments, not only at the Rockefellers' University of
Chicago, but around the U.S.A. Later, beginning the period between the two World
Wars, American pragmatism was blended with the influence of those
Austro-Hungarian emigr&eacute; positivists, like John von Neumann, for example,
who descended upon U.S. philosophy and science departments, often by way of
London, like mating pairs of intellectual cuckoos. In the natural outcome of
such careless breeding practices, today's philosophy departments, and contiguous
academic precincts, are nesting places for a new generation of mongrel strains,
with the resulting hegemony of such Nazi and kindred existentialist doctrines as
those of Nazi philosopher Martin Heidegger, proto-Nazi Friedrich Nietzsche,
Heidegger clone Jean-Paul Sartre, Nazi-like Sartre clone Frantz Fanon, et al.
Throughout this passing hundred years, the pluralist doctrine set forth by
James, beginning his 1897 <B><I>The Will to Believe</I></B>, has been,
functionally, hegemonic in the pragmatic, syncretist, and often fairly Manichean
view of religion, radiated from U.S. centers of higher education.<A HREF="#n16"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 16 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
</P>
<P>The case of William James is of the utmost relevance to the matter addressed
by Ratzinger, on several intersecting counts. First, of all, James' corrosive
influence is near the center of the most pervasive strains of corruption among
both U.S. organized religion, and those churches' missionary tentacles into
Africa, Central and South America, and elsewhere today. As the spread of sundry
cross-breeds with American Pragmatism is traced out, one discovers that James'
influence, on the political side of U.S. official, and other domestic and
foreign practice, parallels closely the corruption purveyed through putatively
religious channels. </P>
<P>Of course, although the U.S.A. is the most powerful nation-state of today's
planet, it is not the most powerful agency. The most powerful agency is the form
assumed by the post-Profumo British Empire, that empire-in-fact which is
euphemistically named the British Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is not an
empire of those misruled poor subjects who inhabit the United Kingdom. It is an
empire belonging to the far-flung Anglo-Dutch maritime-financier oligarchy,
known, in memory of King Edward VII, as the &quot;Club of the Isles.&quot; It is
the predominantly heathen hierarchy of the imperial Church of England (C. of
E.), with its operations coordinated around the world under Anglican covers,
which is, speaking globally, both the principal nasty of the nominally Christian
religious world, and, is also, the principal source of pollution inside the
U.S.A.'s confessions. </P>
<P>From the vantage-point of those poor, naive souls who seek Christianity in
the expressed opinion of nominal Christians, the religious beliefs of today's
world must appear to constitute a Tower of Babel. During the recent thirty
years, the babbling is greatly on the increase. The continued toleration for the
influence of James' Manichean pluralism, typifies the general problem. The view
of this matter, which the Cardinal's remarks prompt us to address, should turn
our attention to the much-neglected, healing principle of truthfulness. How
should this principle of truthfulness be generalized, to the effect of providing
the needed definition of what is, and what is not Christian belief? For example,
how does one deal with the pragmatists? </P>
<P>That brings us to the matter of <B><I>natural law</I></B>. On the subject
of modern natural law, the relevant features of the entire subject-matter may be
represented efficiently in academic programs, at a minimum, by contrasting the
views of Leibniz with those of, on the one side, Hugo Grotius and Leibniz's
contemporary, Samuel Freiherr von Pufendorf; on the other side, both Leibniz's
and Pufendorf's mutually opposing views must be contrasted with the neo-Kantian,
Romantic school of law, of G.W.F. Hegel's crony, Professor Friedrich Carl von
Savigny. For our purposes here, it is sufficient to present the political
highlights of the pathological views of the neo-Kantian Savigny, as seen from
Leibniz's standpoint. </P>
<P>Briefly, then, from the standpoint of the modern nation-state, Savigny is a
throwback to the standpoint of pre-nation-state, feudal society. In feudal
society, and earlier, the practice of statecraft had existed as a perpetual
state of tension between the absolute final power in law-making, reposing in an
imperial potency, interacting with constraints imposed by the sundry, imperially
legalized bodies of religious and other custom, as these latter were to be found
among the subject populations of the empire. The strongest such reference-point
of operational significance within European feudalism had been the infamous,
Malthusian Code of Diocletian. </P>
<P><A NAME="b17">The Fifteenth-Century Golden </A>Renaissance, as typified by
the current running through Nicolaus of Cusa's 1433 <B><I>Concordancia
Catholica</I></B>, supplied the paradigm on which the modern form of sovereign
nation-state was formed, later during that century.<A HREF="#n17"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 17 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> The influence of Cusa and his
associates, in organizing the evangelization of the Americas, and in
establishing the modern sovereign form of nation-state, overthrew the imperial
order of European feudalism, with specifications for replacement of imperial
law, by national law informed by natural law. The Leibnizian 1776 U.S.
Declaration of Independence, and the Leibnizian Preamble of the 1789 U.S.
Federal Constitution, represent the high-point of progress, to the present day,
in the development of a body of nation's law informed by that quality of natural
law intended by Cusa and by Leibniz. </P>
<P><A NAME="b18">Then, came the</A> <A NAME="b19">French Re</A><A NAME="b20">volution</A>
<A NAME="b21">of 1789</A>. The Jacobin leaders typified by Maximilian
Robespierre, were British assets,<A HREF="#n18"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[
18 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> which Shelburne's Bentham used, not only to destroy,
from within, the power of Britain's most dangerous opponent, the France which
was then the most scientifically and economically advanced, leading nation of
Europe. Of even higher priority, was Britain's determination to crush the
widespread support for the American Revolution throughout Europe. The triumph of
the Europe-wide Venetian party at Clement Prince Metternich's (sexual) Congress
of Vienna,<A HREF="#n19"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 19 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
unleashed a brutally pro-feudal reaction throughout Europe. Typical of the
police-state reaction which Metternich unleashed upon all of continental Europe,
were Privy Councillor Savigny and his accomplice, &quot;state philosopher&quot;
(and Metternich agent at the University of Berlin) G.W.F. Hegel.<A HREF="#n20"><B><FONT

SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 21 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A> </P>
<P>One might say fairly, that Savigny's opinions on law, were naturally most
unnatural. </P>
<P><A NAME="b22">In the fields of science and art, Savigny</A> is most
notorious for rendering it almost a law of Prussia, that art should be practiced
according to his personal, neo-Kantian precept, that <B><I>Naturwissenschaft</I></B>
(science) shall be hermetically separated from <B><I>Geisteswissenschaft</I></B>
(the so-called &quot;humanities&quot;). This was the irrationalist aesthetical
dogma which Immanuel Kant had decreed in his <B><I>Critique of Judgment</I></B>.
The Romantic's delusion was that music composed after Metternich's concupiscent
Congress of Vienna, must be interpreted in a Romantic style.<A HREF="#n22"><B><FONT

of the disordered state of mind otherwise revealed by unctuous allusions to <B><I>Weltgeist</I></B>,
<B><I>Zeitgeist</I></B>, and <B><I>Volksgeist</I></B>, the mystical, heathen
rant which still reverberates in academic circles as the hallmark of the
Nineteenth-Century, Romantic reactionaries of post-Vienna Savigny's milieu. </P>
<P>The motive for such neo-feudalist reactionary dogma as Romanticism, was to
nullify the influence of natural law. This was part of turning back the clock of
civilization, to a revival of the pagan imperial law of ancient Mesopotamia,
Rome, Byzantium, and the medieval Holy Roman Empire. </P>
<P><A NAME="b23">During the prolonged, 1815-1848, domination</A> of Europe by
that oligarchical reaction, there were two sets of oligarchical factions which
remained in uneasy alliance against Reason and civilization. Throughout the
continent of Europe, a precursor of today's rapidly degenerating United Nations
Organization's (UNO) supranationalism, was the feudalist federation known as
Metternich's &quot;Holy Alliance.&quot; This power was based upon an uneasy,
temporary partnership with a &quot;new Venice,&quot; the latter represented by
the Anglo-Dutch monarchy's maritime-financier oligarchy of Britain's Jeremy
Bentham, Castlereagh, Canning, and Palmerston. This oligarchic rule, whether by
decadent, landed aristocracies, or insurgent financier nobilities of the
Venice-Dutch-British type, was challenged repeatedly, although repeatedly
victorious, on the continent, whether by Lafayette's noble last effort to revive
France, or as at Hambach and the revolt of the &quot;G&ouml;ttingen Seven&quot;
in Germany, until 1848.<A HREF="#n23"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 23 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
</P>
<P>After that 1848 revolution, which had been organized in the name of
Palmerston's London-based head of &quot;Young Europe,&quot; Giuseppe Mazzini,
the relative power of the continent's old landed aristocracy dwindled. Step by
step, it was humiliated, stripped of its former great power, to become either
absorbed into the ranks of the rising imperial power of the Anglo-Dutch &quot;bourgeois&quot;
financier oligarchy, or to be relegated to the status of virtual museum-pieces.
</P>
<P>Throughout the preceding, 1815-1848 period, despite the intrinsically
reactionary, increasingly overreaching imperial power of London in Europe and
the Americas, there was gradual recovery of those strata of Europe's population
which had been, earlier, intellectually allied with the international figure of
Benjamin Franklin and the cause of the American Revolution. These had been the
Eighteenth-Century strata led by the &quot;poets and thinkers&quot; of all
Europe. Throughout the Nineteenth Century, this same stratum was represented
most prominently, as in Germany and Italy, for example, by a network of
scientists, in the scientific tradition of Gottfried Leibniz, rallied around the
twin images of Carl F. Gauss and Alexander von Humboldt. Especially in Germany,
these strata were actively associated with the Leibniz tradition active inside
the U.S.A. This latter connection was typified by Benjamin Franklin's
great-grandson, West Point graduate Alexander Dallas Bache, and, as Bache also
typified this, that Henry Clay-Henry C. Carey Whig Party which produced the
Republican Party under the leadership of Carey and President Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>Beginning the 1850s, especially following the Crimean War, the United States
developed close ties to the intelligentsia of Germany and Russia, and, later,
to, first, the Meiji Restoration in Japan, and in fostering China's patriotic
movement led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Although these U.S. allies and partners
included, from early on, such patriotic aristocrats in the tradition of France's
Louis XI as Czar Alexander II of Russia, the core of the political allies which
the mid- to late-Nineteenth-Century U.S.A. found in Europe, represented Europe's
patriotic intelligentsia, an intelligentsia for scientific and technological
progress, featuring scholars, scientists, farmer leaders, labor leaders such as
the U.S.A.'s Terence Powderly, and industrialists, thus echoing the nationalist
composition of forces dedicated to freedom and progress inside the U.S.A.
itself. </P>
<P><A NAME="b24">Thus, when we speak of law,</A> we must take into account
these and related facts of history. We must recognize, as the Classical Greeks
did, that we are dealing, in ancient, medieval, and modern history, with,
principally, two distinct species of social organizations: republican versus
oligarchical.<A HREF="#n24"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 24 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
Respecting the political, social, and legal institutions of society, of nations,
we are dealing with a fundamental conflict between these two species of social
organization. </P>
<P>However, proceeding along that pathway of inquiry, we must also recognize,
that one of these species, the republican, is morally and demographically
superior to the other, the oligarchical. Once this fact were taken adequately
into account, we must recognize the difference between oligarchical and
republican law, as presenting us with a Classical form of ontological paradox.
As the Parmenides of Plato's dialogue could not have done, we must find a higher
standard of law, which stands outside and above both oligarchical and republican
forms. We can not solve the paradox created by juxtaposing the two, mutually
exclusive forms of law, until we have focussed our attention on the overriding
fact of the matter: that the republican form, as the Leibnizian <B><I>Preamble</I></B>
of the 1789 U.S. Federal Constitution best typifies this in practice, has always
been superior to the oligarchical form, the latter as fairly exemplified by the
moral and related inferiority of the Lockean Confederate States of America. As
President Lincoln echoed his mentor, Henry C. Carey, on this subject: the U.S.A.
could not have survived as one nation, had it continued to be both slave and
free. The natural law is the efficient principle which underlies, and thus
defines that characteristic difference. </P>
<P>The core of such natural law is elementary. The fact, that mankind is
composed of individual persons each made in the living image of God, and that
this mankind, by means of those qualities of the individual, exerts increasing
dominion of our species within this universe. That fact, is the hard kernel of
truthfulness, upon which knowledge of the natural law depends. During slightly
more than the recent three centuries, the progress of science in European
civilization has provided us the means, through the science of physical economy,
to measure the relevant differences in performance. However, the better we
understand the modern science of physical economy, the better insight we have
into the way in which this conception of natural law was already known during
earlier millennia, as early as <B><I>Genesis</I></B> 1:26-28. </P>
<P>The proposition central to natural law in its entirety, is that mankind's
validated, revolutionary discoveries of principle, are actions through which the
universe submits increasingly to man's will. The power to generate, and to
replicate such validatable discoveries of principle, and assimilate these for
practice, is located within the individual person. This nature of the individual
person is a developable capacity, to such effect that the increase of life
expectancy and knowledgeable practice of the individual, is a self-determining
increase of mankind's power to command nature. The uncovering of those
conceptions, by means of which this process is fostered, is the path of truth;
this truth is the natural law, which mankind may discover, and may obey, but is
not alterable by mankind's whim. </P>
<P>Let the stones speak! Such is the manifest design of the universe, this in
the only manner in which that design is knowable to mankind. Hence, that design
expresses the intent of the Creator of this universe. In other words, the
universe is predesigned to submit to specific characteristics of human Reason.
This experimentally adducible coherence of the individual person's developable
processes of cognition and the universe's response to those processes, is the
basis for human knowledge of natural law. </P>
<P><A NAME="b25">The thus-adducible intent of natural law</A>, is not
expressible in the form of a fixed set of <B><I>shibboleths</I></B>, a fixed
contract. It is neither a covenant, nor a decree by a mortal emperor or other
law-maker. The universe changes; its principles are the principles governing a
constant process of change. Similarly, knowledge is not mere schoolbook
learning; it is not a fixed set of rules of behavior. Knowledge is a prescribed
direction of axiomatic changes of society's behavior, transitions which must be
directed to follow from what natural law demonstrates to have been a relatively
inferior culture, to a relatively superior one.<A HREF="#n25"><B><FONT

<P><A NAME="b27">The crucial scientific proposition</A> of the recent two

It is more than merely the first published articulation of a valid sort of
non-Euclidean, or physical geometry. On reflection, it is to be recognized as a
fulfillment of a long process of development of the principles of human
knowledge, the principles of that method of <B><I>hypothesis</I></B>, running
from Plato's Socratic method, through the work of Gottfried Leibniz and Carl

<P><A NAME="b28">As Plato defined the folly of the Eleatics'</A> attacks on
Pythagoras,<A HREF="#n28"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 28 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
it is the characteristic, common delusion of the so-called &quot;materialists,&quot;
empiricists, and positivists, as of sophists and brutalized minds generally,
that they locate reality as that which corresponds to fixed objects as
putatively defined by sense-perception. As Plato's <B><I>Parmenides</I></B>
indicates, the reason the Eleatics could not solve the relevant ontological
paradox, is these fellows' hysterical refusal, over millennia, to acknowledge
the most important fact common to all experience of our universe: <B><I>change</I></B>.
The glaring factual error common to all these tribes, is the refusal to accept
that such change is the elementary quality of ontological <B><I>fact</I></B>.
</P>
<P>The background-argument most relevant to showing the Manichean heresy
pervading Novak's religious views on the nature of man, is as follows. </P>
<P>Given a series of experienced, mutually distinct physical states. Which is
<B><I>more real</I></B>: those states considered one at a time, or the
principle of <B><I>change</I></B> which underlies the transition from one of
these to another? This brings the dialogue within the <B><I>Parmenides</I></B>
to the challenge posed by Heraclitus earlier: Is such <B><I>change</I></B> an
ontological actuality? If its ontological actuality is acknowledged, then, which
is primary: the individual states, or the change which orders the succession of
those states? </P>
<P>Go directly from that, to the crucial theological question underlying the
political issues posed by the Cardinal's statement: Is God within, or outside
the universe? Is God's presence manifest within the universe which He has
created, but as a presence free from the bounds of time? Is God located, as
Plato locates the <B><I>Good</I></B>, above, and ruling the inferior realm of
that <B><I>Becoming</I></B> which is always inside particular lapses of time?
In the language of Christian theology, does God not dwell in the simultaneity of
eternity? Is this not, for the Christian, also a key to the special nature of
the individual person? </P>
<P><A NAME="b29">This is, very much, a political issue</A>. It is, as I shall
indicate here, the most crucial functional issue of principle in economics, to
such effect, that no advocate of &quot;free trade&quot; could be better than
merely a &quot;virtual Christian&quot;: a play-acting Christian on stage, but
not in his actual belief and character of practice outside the theater of
hypocrisy.<A HREF="#n29"><B><FONT SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 29 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
</P>
<P>For me, the most distinguishing of the common functional characteristics,
the distinguishing wickedness, of the Manichean and the empiricist alike, is
Bernard Mandeville's, Friedrich von Hayek's, and Professor Milton Friedman's
denial of responsibility for <B><I>foreknowledge</I></B>. Since Classical
Greece, this has been the most crucial issue of theology, as Aeschylus' <B><I>Prometheus
Bound</I></B> presents the inevitable doom of false gods. </P>
<P>This issue of foreknowledge, is integral to the Christian notion of God as
dwelling in the simultaneity of eternity. It is also the crucial point which
distinguishes Classical from banal art. It is the chief underlying issue of both
scientific method and statecraft. It is the difference between the moral
accountability for the consequences of one's acts, and also omissions, which is
attributable to persons, as distinct from the notion of anything analogous we
might expect from lower forms of life. It is the difference between Gulliver and
the Yahoos. This is crucial for the Christian comprehension respecting the
nature of man and of God. This is the test which separates the Manichean
political faith of Novak from Christianity. For anyone familiar with Plato's
Socratic method of hypothesis, this is the conception in natural law which
Riemann's 1854 dissertation helps greatly to render more transparent. </P>
<P><B><I>Foreknowledge is individual conscience</I></B>. Conscience is the
faculty of acting, in defiance of Tony Blair's Britain, to prevent a holocaust
of famine in North Korea, or, in defiance of today's Hitler-Britain, to stop a
Museveni-led holocaust of millions of Hutus and others, in Africa, an atrocity
being wittingly funded by former U.S. President George Bush's associates.
Conscience, is frustrating those decrees by the International Monetary Fund, the
which must, if allowed, cause the millions or more deaths we might prevent.
Where does the human faculty of foreknowledge reside? Where does conscience
sleep? </P>

understood as intertwined with the question of the <B><I>ontological proof for
the existence of God</I></B>; that connection is expressed by Classical
Christian theologians in terms of the notion of the location of God's existence
in &quot;the simultaneity of eternity.&quot; The only defensible proof, in both
cases, is supplied by Plato's Socratic method of hypothesis. Here, in addressing
the Manichean characteristics of Novak's adaption to Locke's, Mandeville's,

</P>
<P>In all known cultures, the characteristic feature of successful economic
behavior, is the fact that man is capable of making successful changes in his
present mode of behavior, which changes are governed by foreknowledge of future
consequences of such choices. In this way, the future acts efficiently, for
better, or for worse, to determine the present. The general nature of the
universal principle involved, can be adduced in only one way, by way of Plato's
Socratic method of hypothesis. </P>
<P>The propositions elected as theorems of any deductively consistent system,
are adducibly determined, Socratically, by a ruling set of underlying
assumptions, called an &quot;hypothesis.&quot; This signifies, that a sequence
of theorems determined by that hypothesis, is <B><I>implicitly foreknown</I></B>,
on condition that the hypothesis is known. That is, the hypothesis predetermines
which future propositions will be accepted as members of a theorem-set so
determined. </P>

In all serious modern science, since Nicolaus of Cusa's <B><I>De docta

(i.e., discontinuous) processes are distinguished from one another by
differences in underlying ordering principles of a type cohering with Plato's
notion of hypothesizing the higher hypothesis. This is the method of Johannes

notable, Francis Bacon, the Rosicrucean Robert Fludd, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke,

<P>That said, shift the location of the idea of Platonic foreknowledge, from
focus upon individual selections of ordinary hypotheses, such as those of a
Euclidean geometry, to the standpoint of higher hypothesis, as exempified by a
physical, or &quot;non-Euclidean&quot; geometry, such as that of Riemann. This
is the case, in which newly discovered, and validated principles of nature, and
of the human cognitive processes themselves, oblige us to replace, repeatedly,
our underlying beliefs about nature. Not only that, but as we apply, or fail to
apply this newly acquired knowledge to society's behavior, we bring either
happy, or bad results upon the heads of future generations. </P>
<P>Then, if we have understood those ordering principles, which belong to the
domain of higher hypothesis, we are able to adduce the <B><I>types</I></B> of
consequential situations we may be bringing upon mankind, through our choices of
operating principle in physical economy, as also in other ways. I may justly
invoke the fact, that I have been shown to have been the world's most successful
economic forecaster in this respect, to indicate here, that this view of higher
hypothesis, is the indispensable basis for competence in relatively long-range
forecasting. </P>
<P>To illustrate the pratical relevance of this notion of hypothesis to
day-to-day life of national economy, consider, briefly, some crucial facts about
modern industrial management. The operation of capital-intensive industrial
development, in the context of relatively high rates of technological attrition,
presents us, in each brief interval, with product design and productive
potential supplied by the past, by means of whose productive output, a
reinvestment in needed productive potential, improved product-design, and
technology of increased productivity, is supplied to the future. The failure to
reinvest in the manner needed to offset the technological attrition of the
environment, and other errors of commission and omission, could be fatal to the
future existence of the firm, or of the economy in general. </P>
<P>Compare this with the case for public investment in maintenance and
improvements of basic economic infrastructure. </P>
<P>For any moral form of society, state economic responsibility for the
provision and regulation of public infrastructure, is morally unavoidable, since
its function pertains to the requirements of the whole nation, its entire
population, its entire area, without regard to divisions defined by employment
or private property-titles. Therefore, only an immoral government, or blind
fools, would propose the general privatization of infrastructure. </P>
<P>These requirements include treating the territory of the nation as a wise
farmer prepares a field for cultivation of a specific quality of crop. The
development of general water-management, of related sanitation of entire areas,
sources and distribution of power, health-care facilities and public health
programs, general education up to the level required, technologically and
otherwise, from the future generation of adults, and fundamental scientific
research and development, are matters which could never competently be left to
the confines of private ownership. Nor is there any way in which to meter the
benefits of public infrastructure in such a fashion, that a private toll-system,
rather than a combination of taxation and government rates-regulation, could
function in this domain, in the sense it may be shown to function very well in
sales of the output of agriculture, mining, and manufacture, for example. </P>
<P>Foreknowledge is crucial for government in matters of designs and
commitments for programs of maintenance and improvement of public
infrastructure. </P>
<P>Measure the impact and replacement of infrastructure in terms of half-life
spans: Half the number of years the installation in question might be expected
to function in a satisfactory way. There are two such half-lives to be
considered. One, is the simple physical half-life, assuming no significant sort
of relevant change in technology. In such an assumed case, the chief variable
factor would be degree of net wear and tear. The second, is the acceleration of
the potential obsolescence of the installation, as affected by increases in
rates of technological attrition in the economy generally. Also, take into
account, the span of life required to make these installations. </P>
<P>The related policy decisions must be made with regard for developments,
years, even decades into the future. Thus, foreknowledge of the future is not
only indispensable, but we must shape the making of those policies today,
through taking efficiently into consideration the foreknowable impact upon the
future. </P>
<P>The obvious difference, between the nature of God and man, lies in the
imperfection of human foreknowledge; the similarity, lies in the principle of
foreknowledge. Thus, Plato differentiates the attainable competence of mortal
mankind to lie within the bounds of what Plato terms the <B><I>Becoming</I></B>.
That conception correlates with a generalized notion for <B><I>hypothesizing
the higher hypothesis</I></B>. Since God exists within the simultaneity of
eternity, when we reference God's nature, according to natural law, instead of &quot;hypothesis,&quot;
or &quot;Becoming,&quot; we must speak, as Plato does, of the <B><I>Good</I></B>.
Conscience is, then, foreknowledge governed by the ordering-principle intrinsic
to <B><I>agape</I></B>.           </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Mandeville: The Principle of Evil</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If one were to ask, &quot;What is the single example of behavior in U.S.
churches today, which most efficiently betrays something rotten afoot within the
American religious psyche,&quot; I would answer, &quot;The singing of a hymn
called ?Amazing Grace.' &quot; How could God's noblest creatures, assembled
ostensibly to address the Almighty Himself, refer to themselves as &quot;a
wretch like me&quot;? Who is their god? Is he some monstrous Babylonian tyrant,
ostensibly spawned by the bowels of Baal, before whom the slave must debase
himself? Or, is our loving God foolishly blind, that he would love trash, would
have created such trash, and would not be embarrassed to have packs of such
miserable creatures, like filthy beggars, grabbing at his garment, claiming him
as their Father? That hymn reeks of Manicheanism. Or, to say the same thing, it
expresses the Babylonian misconception of human nature which is axiomatic for
the modern British culture of Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Bernard
Mandeville, Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, and Friedrich
von Hayek's Mont Pelerin Society. </P>
<P>Contrary to the plaintive, off-key cries of such professedly worthless
creatures as those poor singers, the Christian defines himself, or herself, as
what Christ expects mankind to become. To the Christian, at worst, man betrays
his nature, if he becomes like an angel fallen into the endless abyss, or,
strays as a redeemable &quot;prodigal son.&quot; Man and woman were created to
be the noblest creatures of this universe, and, each person ought to live up to
that. Our frailty is, that each of us has but a brief span of mortal life,
during which each must find the meaning of his personal existence within God's
simultaneity of eternity. Each must use the mortal journey and its inhering
passions, as the cognitive processes of thought make use of the living organism
in which they reside; but let none of us lose his or her sense of identity, to
become ruled by unleashing of the blind passions of the vehicle we briefly
occupy. Each among us has little time to waste, and, therefore, should get
quickly about that business. </P>
<P>Man becomes bad, only when he, like Mani, like the Bogomils, like Hobbes and
Mandeville, repudiates the sense of ultimate self-interest in living a life of
continuous atonement with the God Who loved him. </P>
<P>We express those Christian truths, when we look at individual people in
general as also God's noblest creation, when we care efficiently about the
nature of the cultural, political, and other conditions which powerful, often
too-powerful institutions impose upon this individual, noblest creature of
Creation. </P>
<P><A NAME="b41">Turn your attention, now</A>, to that assortment of
practicing modern Manicheans and buggers, typified by Francis Bacon, Thomas
Hobbes, John Locke, David Hume, Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant, Jeremy Bentham,
Friedrich von Hayek, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, and Michael Novak.<A HREF="#n41"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 41 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
</P>
<P>The general principle, upon which all among these premise their recipes for
the governance of society, including its economic affairs, is the
Hobbes-Mandeville-Quesnay doctrine of what is identified variously by Hobbes' &quot;war
of each against all,&quot; the slave-owner's dogma of John Locke's &quot;Life,
Liberty, and [you are my] Property,&quot; the feudal landowning aristocrat's
insolence of Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay's &quot;laissez-faire,&quot; the &quot;moral
philosophy&quot; of Adam Smith's drug-traffickers' doctrine of &quot;free trade,&quot;
and the &quot;felicific [hedonistic] calculus&quot; of terrorist controller
Jeremy Bentham's <B><I>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and
Legislation</I></B>. Here, amid this Manichean collection, lies the political
soul of Michael Novak, and, for that matter, of wretched Associate Justice
Antonin Scalia, too. </P>
<P>The common characteristic of these fallen creatures, is the Manichean
doctrine, that man is intrinsically given to evil, and that society must be
designed and ruled accordingly. All premise their moral philosophy, on the
demand, that the greatest freedom to the interplay of each, among themselves and
their friends, be afforded to such individuals' lusty pursuit of the Seven
Deadly Sins, the which, in their view, define the inherently sulfurous qualities
of &quot;human nature,&quot; especially their own. All of these derive their
social theories, from the same cloth of anarchy, even if they cut the garments
differently. </P>
<P>This cloth has two most notable characteristics. On whatever class of
persons its proponents bestow the free expression of lusty libertarianism, they
insist that no principle contrary to the axioms of mephistophelean anarchy be
imposed, and no other form of regulation than those upon which the participants
in warfare or other bodily-contact sport might agree among themselves, in the
spirit of covenanting mutually tolerable rules of the game. On this point, it is
convenient to compare the fictional Lemuel Gulliver's account of a journey to
Hugh Walpole's Houyhnhnm-Britain, with a recent utterance from the indefatigably
nasty Lord William Rees-Mogg. </P>
<P><A NAME="b42">View Houyhnhnm-Britain, then</A>, and now, according to the
sportly image of &quot;rules of the game.&quot; The ruling spectacle of lordly
horses' posteriors, compared with the illiterate and constantly rutting Yahoos,
presents us a spectacle reminding us of the contrast of the murderous oligarchy
and hapless slaves of Lycurgus' Sparta. The Houyhnhnms, like today's U.S.
National Endowment for Democracy, allow their victims the greatest degree of
libertarian license to do almost anything to one another, but engage in literate
utterance, or actually shape any among the crucial policies of their government.
To precisely the same effect, a real-life pompous ass, Lord William Rees-Mogg,
lauds the lunacy of Newt Gingrich's Alvin Toffler, with the happy information,
that all of these antics with &quot;information society&quot; will end up with
ninety-five percent of the population denied any education at all. Meanwhile,
according to Rees-Mogg, the lordly five percent, whose bodily functions
mysteriously secrete &quot;information,&quot; will sequester themselves in
safety, in isolatable, sanitary locations, such as the Channel Islands, away
from the mayhem and epidemic diseases of the majority.<A HREF="#n42"><B><FONT
SIZE="-2"><NOBR>[ 42 ]</NOBR></FONT></B></A>
</P>
<P>The essential point, as the case of Houyhnhnm-Britain, then and now,
illustrates, is that the would-be overlords, for the first part, do not wish
outsiders to think that the master-class would tolerate any <B><I>outside</I></B>
regulation of its libertarian sport. Their overlordships, as insiders, may
choose to regulate themselves, <B><I>privately</I></B>, but will permit no
government under the influence of &quot;outsiders&quot; to interfere in their
peculiar forms of economic, or other heteronomic pleasure-seeking. Not only is
lusty libertarianism their hedonist's peculiar pleasure, but, as the wicked Adam
Smith, Professor Milton Friedmann, and George Soros concur on this point, they
are also amused to spread the &quot;freedom of anarchy,&quot; such as free use
of dangerous recreational substances and activities, among their intended
victims. In the latter case, anarchy, with its inexhaustible, mephistophelean
capacity for creating mischief, might do its corrosive work, keeping the
inhabitants of the slave-quarter either stupefied, or busily at one another's
throats. Such freedom given, is freedom effectively denied. </P>
<P>Thus, the first leading feature of their dogma, is the same satanic
sophistry familiar to students of such forms of gnosticism as Manicheanism and
the <B><I>Bogomils</I></B>. This brings us to the second leading feature of
their mind-set, the &quot;magic of the marketplace.&quot; If you are one of
those who smells a secret, voodoo, or Bogomil ritual, in that enunciation of &quot;magic,&quot;
you are on the right track. </P>
<P>From the standpoint of mathematics (and the medieval Bogomil loan-sharks
were a notoriously calculating crew), the theory of the &quot;magic of the
marketplace,&quot; reduces itself to the argument, that an overdose of entropy
brings on a state of negative entropy. In other words, the doctrine of &quot;free
trade,&quot; as presented by Quesnay or Adam Smith, is a pure and simple,
intentional hoax, perpetrated by Wall Street and kindred used-stock salesmen
upon their all too credulous intended victims. Just as the most powerful, most
advanced among the Eighteenth-Century nation-states, France, was bankrupted in
less than a decade by adoption of a &quot;free trade&quot; policy, the same ruin
has been suffered by every nation, beginning with Portugal, which was foolish
enough to submit to this British dogma. </P>
<P>It happened to the U.S.A. under Jefferson, Madison, Jackson, van Buren,
Pierce, Buchanan, Teddy Roosevelt, at the end of the Woodrow Wilson regime,
under Andrew Mellon's Calvin Coolidge, under the pre-Korean War Truman, under
the second Eisenhower administration, under Carter, Reagan, and Bush, and, with
some qualifications, still rules the national economic roost under Clinton. As I
have presented the case in earlier locations, during the present century to
date, the only time the U.S. was not sliding downward in physical-economic
terms, as it has been throughout the 1970-1997 interval to date, was during
mobilizations for possible, or ongoing general warfare. Only under those
conditions, was &quot;Free trade&quot; curbed to the degree, that the natural
inclination of our pre-1966 economy toward prosperity was permitted efficient
expression. Every other nation has had similar experience with playing its turn
as sucker for the &quot;free trade&quot; pitch. Experience says, that perhaps,
President Abraham Lincoln's famous quip should be corrected, to emphasize, that
when it comes to free trade, &quot;you may fool nearly all of the people, nearly
all of the time--except in times of war.&quot; </P>
<P>The acceptance of &quot;free trade&quot; does not come from experience. It
comes from a self-destructive ideological streak within the mind of the dupe.
Sometimes this is expressed by extremely &quot;unagapic&quot; gloating by the
typical citizen over the cheaper prices at his store, should he encourage
unemployment among Americans, by producing the same articles with cheap,
sometimes virtually slave labor, abroad. There is a satanic element in this
expression of greed by the typical, foolish citizen. The poor fellow will find
himself, herself, and family suffering from his own, greedy, credulous folly,
soon enough. He has made, in that way, a gnostic's Faustian pack with Satan, the
Tempter who said, &quot;Give me your free trade, and I will give you things at
cheaper prices.&quot; He believes in &quot;free trade,&quot; not because of lack
of overwhelming, historic evidence that this is a swindle. He believes in &quot;free
trade&quot; as he believes in &quot;lucky numbers&quot; at the gambling table
where he lost his family's fortune. He has joined the gnostic church of British
mysticism. </P>
<P>I mentioned, above, another, mathematical dimension to the &quot;free trade&quot;
hoax. The swindle is called, euphemistically, &quot;statistics.&quot; The method
employed is inherently fraudulent. Pick a set of monetary and other statistics.
After a sufficient number of tries, concoct what is termed &quot;a fallacy of
composition.&quot; Construct this in a way which will delude the intended
onlooker to believe that he is seeing what the relevant &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;
may tell him is &quot;A very robust statistical correlation.&quot; If the victim
appears to be duly impressed by this admission to the arcana of mathematical
mysteries, the wizard in question will lay it a bit thicker, as hoaxsters are
wont to do; he may even go so far as to lure his prospect into the Alpine
remoteness of &quot;the ergodic theorem.&quot; </P>
<P>The decisive observation to make on such wizardy, is, that there is no
reason underlying the supposed statistical correlation. There is no necessary
connection; there is merely sleight-of-hand, the suggestion of magic. This is
the same principle of magic used by Gnostics and other religious swindlers,
since no later than early Semitic cultures of Mesopotamia, to hoodwink the
credulous. It &quot;works,&quot; not because there is rationality involved in
the so-called proof; it is purely tricksterism, worthy of the priests of
Abraxas, or of the cult of Delphi. The suckers are hooked by their own
propensities for erotic moods of cupidity. Like all pro-satanic cults, the cult
of the marketplace is based upon the catechism of Mephistopheles, the will to
cheat, even at the price of a pact with the Devil. </P>
<P>In history, the waxing and waning of such cultish influences as that of &quot;free
trade,&quot; is associated with the increase or decrease of what is called &quot;cultural
pessimism.&quot; We are presented, as in the process of transforming depressed
post-World War I Germans into future Nazi Party members, with the persons whose
natural, childish optimism toward life is crushed, and who, in that degraded
state of mind, lose faith in God himself, and would, if not altogether
repudiating him, prefer, at least for a time, a cozy nook in Hell, to the
glories of martyrdom. <B><I>Sic transit gloria Novak!</I></B>

<H3>The New Dark Age in progress</H3></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What is behind all this, which the pathetic case of Novak reflects? What is
the inner logic which has caused the precipitous degeneration of religion in the
U.S.A., and elsewhere, during the recent thirty-odd years? If we look at the
condition of the Catholic Church, world-wide, for example, the proliferation of
strange cults and alien doctrines there, is comparable only to the religious
condition which spread through Europe like a pandemic during the Fourteenth
Century's New Dark Age, the time to which modern Catholic officials frequently
refer as that confession's &quot;Babylonian captivity.&quot; The situation
outside that Church, is, if anything, far worse, the decadence, even depravity,
more virulent in its character and rapidity of spread. The history of this
virtually world-wide pathology, suffices to prove that the root of the problem
inside the Catholic Church, for example, has nothing to do with the inner
proceedings of Vatican II. </P>
<P>The paradigmatic character of the onset of this presently accelerating
global catastrophe, is the rapid spread of the &quot;New Age&quot;
youth-counterculture, the rock-drug-sex counterculture, and the 1969-1970
launching of the mass-based &quot;ecology movement&quot; hoax. In the U.S.A., as
in Germany, France, and Italy, for example, this countercultural ferment, was
devised chiefly by the so-called &quot;Frankfurt School&quot; of Theodor Adorno,
et al., in concert with the London Tavistock Clinic/Institute, and under the
direction of the Prince Consorts of Britain and the Netherlands, with their &quot;World
Wildlife Fund/1001 Club&quot; backing. The initial target of this
countercultural operation was the university youth, in other words, those whose
subsequent &quot;march through the institutions&quot; would determine the
philosophy and moral character of the future, top-most positions of power in
government,  universities, science, educational institutions, and churches. </P>
<P>Although then in a relatively very modest role, I participated in the
losing, rear-guard effort to stem that countercultural tide, during the entirety
of the second half of the 1960s. I did not succeed in that aspect of my efforts,
except to earn the undying hatred of the other side, including the circles
behind this operation, including the Ford Foundation's McGeorge Bundy. I know
that history, in painfully intimate detail, as it is said, &quot;like the back
of my hand.&quot; I do not need statistics to tell me what happened; I knew,
first-hand, promising young minds which were destroyed, step by step, over an
interval of several or more years. From my experience with this in the U.S.A.,
and the nature of my increasing involvement in activities in other continents, I
was pre-qualified to delve deeply, and clinically, into the similar processes
ongoing in Europe and in Central and South America. From that combination of
first-hand and correlated experience, then and later, I report that most of the
published reports on the transformations of mind-set which occurred within the &quot;
'68 &quot; university-campus generation then, are, in their principal features,
fairy tales, composed to console some special pleading. </P>
<P>Very simply, two processes unfolding during the 1961-1968 interval, must be
taken into account, to understand what happened to the minds of the majority of
that U.S. generation of campus &quot;Baby Boomers.&quot; On the one side, there
was the optimism fostered by President Kennedy's manifest executive capacities
in handling the steel barons and other matters, and, especially in the impact of
his launching of the &quot;crash program&quot; for the later manned landing on
the Moon. On the negative, depressive side, the obvious events, were the
critical week of sheer terror during the 1962 missiles crisis, the subsequent
assassination of the President, the post-Kennedy escalation of the Indo-China
adventure, and the 1968 assassination of Reverend Martin Luther King. The
pessimistic factors added up to a Tavistockian &quot;shell shock,&quot;
producing a stunning display of ultra-labile suggestibility in the majority of
the campus student population which I was in a position to study, either
directly, or through clinical study of the relevant proliferation of literature
from radical-student and other sources from that period.  </P>
<P>There was a deeper, less visible, but powerful stream, a stream more
directly relevant to religious belief. </P>
<P>Cultural optimism in modern society is most widely associated with the
individual's sense that he, or she is sharing with peers a personally confident
outlook conveyed by the vernacular &quot;I can do it,&quot; or, &quot;I can
learn to do it.&quot; In U.S. history, this quality of optimism is associated
with a sense of actual or prospective participation in a generality of
scientific and technological progress in qualities of products and
science-related services, and in the productive powers of labor. Even in the
case of the present, or former pupil who falls into Friedrich Schiller's
category of <B><I>Brotgelehrte</I></B>, the pupil who trains to sing for his,
or her supper, not the music, something of the music slips through, as if
osmotically, if the general social climate is one of optimism. </P>
<P>From the considerations I have outlined earlier here, the relationship
between personal cultural optimism so fostered, and <B><I>agape</I></B>, is
obvious. The individual's reenactment of discoveries of principle, evokes that
<B><I>agape</I></B>, and encourages the student, for example, to seek to
locate his, or her personal identity in terms of that experience of <B><I>agape</I></B>,
in so-called technical matters, but, also, a correlated enhancement of the
disposition for enjoyment of this same quality in Classical forms of art. The
most crucial factor in the manifest shifts to countercultural, existential
pessimism, within the &quot;68&quot; generation, was, principally, the argument
that the missile-crisis and the Vietnam escalation proved that the generation of
the students' parents was evil in allowing these things to be brought about, and
that technological progress was bad, and should be superseded by a flight from
reality, into &quot;inner&quot; existentialist gratifications implicitly
proposed by depraved Herbert Marcuse's <B><I>One-Dimensional Man</I></B>. </P>
<P>Characteristic of the shift, was the sudden eruption of &quot;consumerism.&quot;
Whereas previous U.S. generations had defined themselves as both producers and
consumers, we were suddenly faced with a large ration of these students who
viewed insanely those who produced the goods on which life depended, as if the
working operatives who produced wealth were the arch-adversary of themselves, as
consumers. In this specific connection, it would be  difficult to overstate the
shocking, almost amoebic degree of lability, which I witnessed within a sampling
of the majority of the &quot;68&quot; generation. The victims of this lability
became the self-defined &quot;useless generation,&quot; parasites who took
personal pride in the allegedly superior morality of that personal &quot;commitment.&quot;
In short, like Hermann Hesse's wretched <B><I>Steppenwolf</I></B>, they had
developed such Heidegger-like, hate-filled, existentialist pessimism toward both
society their own selves, that they filled the prescription of <B><I>Amazing
Grace</I></B>--minus the rescue. </P>
<P>What happened to religion during those years, was no product of some
suspected aberration within the proceedings of Vatican II. During those years,
virtually the entire world had been driven morally insane. The 1962
missiles-crisis was as much a symptom of the issue, as a causal factor; it were
fairly described as the detonator of a social charge of pessimism which had been
building over the course of the century since the assassination of President
William McKinley, brought those spawn of the Confederacy, Teddy Roosevelt and
KKK co-sponsor Woodrow Wilson, into the U.S. Presidency. In addition, there was
the accumulation of two World Wars, the fraud and evil of the Versailles Treaty,
a deep Depression, the rise and horrors of fascism in Europe, and President
Truman's willful plunging of the U.S. economy back into a virtual new economic
depression, at the close of the war, an accumulation which exploded with the
succession of cultural shocks hitting the world's adolescent campus populations
during the middle of the 1960s. </P>
<P>Now, as to the immediate and longer-term future: what does the presently
hegemonic, &quot;New Age&quot; cultural-paradigm portend for religion, and for
the very existence of civilized life? </P>
<P>The short answer is, that the danger comes not so much from any other source
as what we might conveniently identify as &quot;The Sodom and Gomorrah
Principle.&quot; As measured in the only really meaningful terms,
physical-economic terms, the U.S. economy has been contracting by a net amount
in excess of two percent per year during the recent twenty-five-odd years, since
1970. The attempt to maintain financial profitability of some enterprises, has
therefore found a substitute for national-economic profitability in escalating
rates of looting of previous decades' former capital investments,  by both
government and private interests, in all categories of basic economic
infrastructure, education, physical-economic standard of living per-capita of
labor-force, in liquidation of entire industries, and in the mountain of
financial indebtedness which has been increasingly a substitute source of income
for financial markets and personal-credit-card holders. </P>
<P>We have reached the point, world-wide, that this planet is currently
operating, in physical-economics, so far below the break-even point, that any
significant continuation of presently hegemonic &quot;New Age&quot; measures,
such as those pushed with violence by Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair,
brings us to the brink of the condition, that the inevitable chain-reaction
disintegration of the present international financial bubble, would be echoed by
a similar collapse of physical economy itself. Given the presently hegemonic
cultural paradigms in policy-shaping of leading governments and supranational
institutions, it would be inevitable that the planet as a whole, including
China, would be drawn into an accelerating collapse of the conditions required
to sustain human life, planet-wide. The combination of murderous anarchy, now
being unleashed on Africa, and in the Korea pennisula, spreading across
continents, launches the legendary &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;
on all continents, portending a general collapse of the human population toward
a maximum population of not more than the several hundred millions potential
which was characteristic of this planet over the span of the centuries from the
establishment of the Roman Empire into Europe's Fourteenth Century. </P>
<P>This outcome is not yet inevitable, but, unless we change what must be
changed very soon, it will become so. </P>
<P>The lesson to be applied, is the cruel fact, that during the estimated two
millions years mankind has existed on this planet, most of the once-dominant
cultures were eradicated for reason of their clinging too long to a cultural
paradigm which doomed them, as cultures which had lost the moral fitness to
survive, as if they were of the class of Biblical, doomed Cities of the Plain.
For reason of many things, this present planetary civilization is very near to
the brink of a global catastrophe of that type. I do not anticipate that such a
collapse would end the existence of our species, though we are coming close to
such a catastrophe. I anticipate, that as in most of  human existence to date,
cultures which have remained too long morally unfit to survive, are naturally
purged from the human species, by such catastrophes as may be sufficient to
expel such degraded cultural-paradigms from human culture at large. I do not
propose that that outcome is inevitable in the present case; I propose, merely,
that it will happen, unless we quickly change our ways, and repudiate the New
Age cultural-paradigm-shift so visibly dear to those behind Britain's Tony Blair
today. </P>
<P>What is happening to religion, to Christianity in particular, may be viewed
most profitably as an echo of the so-called &quot;Babylonian capitivity&quot; of
the Fourteenth Century's New Dark Age. It were wiser of us, in viewing that
state of religion today, to spend less effort in either adapting to, or
lamenting such a state of affairs, and more in reversing it. For both practical
and spiritual reasons, the most crucial aspect of the New Age corruption which
must be reversed, if the U.S.A. is to assuredly outlive this century, is the
kind of Manicheanism which Michael Novak expresses by his gnostic's reliance on
&quot;the magic of the marketplace.&quot;  </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

intelligence operations of this type have been run, not so much through the

under the rubric of &quot;focal point,&quot; the &quot;knuckle draggers&quot; of
the Joint Chiefs Staff's Special Warfare/Special Operations  sections, notably
the logistics section. From Dec. 1981, Vice-President George Bush ran what came

of the Quango is not the U.S. government using private covers, but, rather,
private interests using the protective cover of association with the U.S.
government. In the U.S.-related cases, the U.S. is imitating standard practice
of the British Privy Council's dirty operations: using the authority of

are derived from the influence, through and beyond the time of Apollo-priest
Plutarch, of the pantheonic, (and, &quot;loan-sharking&quot;) Delphi cult of
Gaea, Python-Dionysos, and Apollo. There are crucial connections between the
Delphic Gaea-Python cult, and the ancient satanic, Shakti-Siva cult of the
Indian sub-continent, and to the Hellenistic form of the Egyptian Isis-Osiris
cult, as also the kindred cults of the Shakti-Siva type, such as Ishtar,
Astarte, etc., exported from the western regions of the ancient Indian
Subcontinent, into ancient Sheba, the Horn of Africa, and the ancient
Philistines (Phoenicians). The chief source of recent syncretic revivals of
these ancient, polymorphously pagan cults, has been the British Empire. The
radiation of Lucifer-worship into continental Europe via the theosophist
movements, such as Aleister Crowley's &quot;Golden Dawn&quot; and Alex Muenthe's
anti-Christ cult of Tiberius, based on Capri, was primarily a British
Nineteenth-Century continuation of those Eighteenth-Century British Hell-Fire
Clubs, dating from the influence of pro-satanic Bernard Mandeville upon Georgian
Britain. The synthesis of what became known as &quot;rock,&quot; was a product
of pro-satanic projects conducted, in association with Aleister Crowley's
theosophists, under the auspices of the London Tavistock Clinic/Institute. In
furtherance of this latter project, &quot;field studies&quot; of putative
survivals of primitive satanic cults, such as the Afro-Cuban serpent worship,
were part of the synthesis of what British cultural warfare unleashed as the
rock &quot;music&quot; of both Tavistock's MK-Ultra 1950s, and the more frankly
satanic rock popularized as an integral part of the 1960s propagation of the &quot;rock,

(e.g., deductive-inductive)  theorem-lattice, is the condition, that no
proposition may be a theorem of that lattice, if it contradicts any among the
set of definitions, axioms, and postulates constituting the lattice's underlying
hypothesis. Thus, any change in the set of terms of which the hypothesis
represents, changes the conditions defining any and all propositions of the
former theorem-lattice as theorems. This change within an hypothesis, even as
the assumed mere addition of a new physical principle might be that change, thus
creates a new hypothesis, which is inconsistent with the relevant hypothesis
extant prior to the change. For example, Eratosthenes' measured estimate for the
length of the Earth's meridian, which assumed merely that the Sun is a very
large distance from the Earth, showed a definite rate of curvature of the
measured distance from Syene (Aswan) to Alexandria, in Egypt. This showed, that
at each tiniest interval along the meridian, any apparent straight line is
curved. Thus, we must measure the Earth's surface not in two dimensions, but
three. The third dimension, makes any such putative straight line &quot;infinitely
discontinuous&quot; in the most extremely small interval. This is representative
of the general case, that every new hypothesis is deductively absolutely
discontinuous with the relevant preceding hypothesis. This approach, as
developed, by way of the experimental principles implicit in biquadratic
residues, into a general theory of curvature, by Carl Gauss, was the
starting-point for Riemann's revolutionary discovery of a true physical (&quot;non-Euclidean&quot;)

cognition is anti-entropic. Since the universe obeys man only through such

				<LI><A NAME="n40">The apotheosis of black-magic cultist Sir Isaac Newton, was
an ideological prank concocted by the Paris-based controller of Venice's
intelligence service, Abbe Antonio Conti. In fact, as was reluctantly
acknowledged by the Newtonians, early during the Nineteenth Century, Newton had
never actually produced a calculus, but merely a bad, unworkable parody of the 
calculus produced more than a decade earlier by Gottfried Leibniz. Conti's
object in his apotheosis of Newton, was political. At that time, Leibniz was the
most powerful intellectual influence throughout Europe, an influence which
extended with increasing force into Eighteenth-Century English-speaking America.
The effort to discredit Leibniz's unrivalled accomplishments as a scientist, was
the flank upon which Conti et al. deployed a far-flung network of &quot;Newton-cult&quot;
cells among key centers throughout Europe. Voltaire was a key agent of Conti's
in this enterprise, as was the pro-Malthusian (e.g., Giammaria Ortes) cabal of
Maupertuis, Euler, et al. at Frederick &quot;the Great's&quot; Berlin Academy. </A><A HREF="#b40"><B><FONT SIZE="-1">[ return to text ]<br>

				<LI><A NAME="n41">Otherwise known in Italy, as &quot;Cathari,&quot; in France
as either &quot;Cathars&quot; or <B><I>les bougres</I></B>, or, in England, as
&quot;buggers.&quot; In the account of Lord Shelburne's Gibbon, the Bogomils
were a variant of the Manichean cult previously established in Byzantine Thrace
(modern Bulgaria), by the Byzantine emperor for political-strategic reasons.
That account, some errors noted, is essentially accurate. They still exist in
southern France today, as was observed when President Fran2ois Mitterrand
participated in a family christening rite at one of the more famous cult-sites;
they have been sponsored by Dominique Schlumberger de Menil, who, with her
sister, were long-standing associates and supporters of the Mitterrand
household. They are most notorious, of course, for the sect's medieval colonies
in the region of Toulouse and Albi, but were also powerful in the Rhone region
of France and Switzerland. Otherwise, they share the pro-satanic
characteristics, and penchant for strange sexual practices, with the still very
significant representation of Gnostic cults generally, as in Venezuela and
Colombia. They are most notable for their conception of the &quot;elect,&quot; a
feature of their religion which was syncretically coopted into John Calvin's
argument. There are also syncretic cooptings of this in the Rosicruceanism of
Robert Fludd et al., and in branches of modern freemasonry. The Faust image of &quot;pact
with Satan,&quot; as portrayed in Christopher Marlowe's <B><I>Dr. Faustus</I></B>,
is fairly representative of their ideological type. They also acquired standing
among Hitler's Nazis, including the circles of Nazi Professor of Philosophy
Martin Heidegger.</A> <B><FONT SIZE="-1">[ return to text ]<br>
