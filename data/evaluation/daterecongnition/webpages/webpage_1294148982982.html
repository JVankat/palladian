<META name="description" content="Download free, exotic, unique, and inspiring Reaktor ensembles and Soundfonts which are unlike any you have seen on the net. I have been an electronic musician since 1968, a synthesizer builder since 1974, and a bona fide electrical engineer since 1984.  Synthesis is my oxygen, and I think you will agree that the ensembles here demonstrate that.">

<P>In 1968, my brother gave me a copy of "Switched-On Bach" by Wendy Carlos.  I was only 9 years old then, but I vowed then and there that I would dedicate my life to making electronic music.  I spent the next 6 years torturing my dad's reel-to-reel tape recorder in bizarre and frightening experiments.

At age 12, I won a radio music contest when one of my tape experiments was unleashed on the public airwaves.  At age 14, I designed and built my first analog synthesizer (photo at left).  At 22, I built another synth, a digital one this time. When life and the real world got in the way, I had to put my music on hold for 17 long years.
<P>In 1998 I began to build the studio I had dreamed of all my life with the help of family and friends.  When I sat down to compose, the sounds burst forth and overwhelmed me like floodwaters from a ruptured dam.  The speakers spilled out ecstasy, fear, lust, and the tears of six thousand lost days.  Fellow musicians, family & friends celebrated and encouraged me to publish and promote the music that had been bottled up inside for so long.
<P>I have always applied my engineering side to the creation of musical technology. Even as a tot I decided that building synths really was a kind of sorcery, and I was determined to become a practitioner.  Music is the reason I went to engineering school. I attended Rochester Institute of Technology and The University Of Buffalo, earning a BS in Electrical Engineering in 1984.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2 FACE="Courier New">TODAY</FONT>

<P>I am a techno-guru with a plasma torch burning inside of me, composing electronic music ranging from the exotic to the hypnotic.  By day, I slave within the vast US military-security-industrial complex, inventing ways to save the world from the bad guys of the future.  By night, I switch on the other half of my brain and release vast quantities of endorphins and caffeine into my bloodstream.  I then proceed to record the soundtracks of my dreams and nightmares.
<P>Lately, I've been obsessed with creating new tools for my musical work.  I thoroughly test each tool in actual production, so each is tweaked to perfection.
<P>Cynical and easily bored, I am determined to take my music far from the safe cozy playpens of our spoon-fed culture.  Musical influences and inspirations include Wendy Carlos, BT, Future Sound of London, The Orb, Isao Tomita, Kraftwerk, Jean-Michel Jarre, Mike Oldfield, Tangerine Dream, & Bjork.
