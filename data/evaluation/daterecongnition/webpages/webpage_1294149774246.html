              <p><font size="2">I<b>n June, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court in </b> <strong>
              <em><u>Troxel v. Granville</u></em></strong><b>, in one of its rare 
              decisions in the Family Law area, reshaped the definition of 
              family by determining who has the power to control possession of 
              minor children. The decision has been hailed as a victory for 
              parents rights and a defeat for grandparents rights. However, the 
              decision should not have a tremendous effect in Texas for reasons 
              hereafter stated.</b></font></p>
              <p><b><font size="2">In <em>Troxe</em>l, the surviving parent of a 
              child objected, not to the parental grandparents having possession 
              of the grandkids, but to the amount of time of possession. The 
              case, procedurally, affirmed the Washington Supreme Court's 
              overturning of its non-parent possession statute, which was called 
              &quot;breathtakingly broad&quot;, by the U.S. Supreme Court. In essence, the 
              U.S. Supreme Court indicated that it disapproves of an extremely 
              broad statute that allows any person-including any person from off 
              the street-from being able to have standing to come into Court and 
              force a parent to show a judge that it is not in the child's best 
              interest for this third party to have possession rights. The U.S. 
              Supreme Court noted that all fifty states have grandparent 
              possession statutes and was unwilling to extend this <em>Troxel</em> 
              ruling beyond the, again, &quot;breathtakingly broad&quot; Washington 
              statute.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font size="2">The Texas Family Code provisions for third party 
              access are narrow, and therefore should not suffer the same 
              sweeping judgment as the Washington statute. Challenges to 
              existing Orders will most likely continue to be on a material 
              change of condition standard with the Court, once it is satisfied 
              that there is standing for the suit to proceed. The Question for 
              the Court to answer:&quot;Is it in the best interest of the child for 
              'X' to have possession time of the child?&quot; (Where 'X' being the 
              third party, generally a grandparent, but could be another person 
              with whom the child is actually resided for an extended period of 
              time). As in common law marriage cases, look for a two step 
              procedure to develop to more efficiently handle the ramifications 
              of <em>Troxel</em>.</font></b></p>

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Washington Rev. Code �26.10.160(3) 
              permits �[a]ny person� to petition for visitation rights �at any 
              time� and authorizes state superior courts to grant such rights 
              whenever visitation may serve a child�s best interest. Petitioners 
              Troxel petitioned for the right to visit their deceased son�s 
              daughters. Respondent Granville, the girls� mother, did not oppose 
              all visitation, but objected to the amount sought by the Troxels. 
              The Superior Court ordered more visitation than Granville desired, 
              and she appealed. The State Court of Appeals reversed and 
              dismissed the Troxels� petition. In affirming, the State Supreme 
              Court held, <i>inter alia,</i> that �26.10.160(3) 
              unconstitutionally infringes on parents� fundamental right to rear 
              their children. Reasoning that the Federal Constitution permits a 
              State to interfere with this right only to prevent harm or 
              potential harm to the child, it found that �26.10.160(3) does not 
              require a threshold showing of harm and sweeps too broadly by 
              permitting any person to petition at any time with the only 
              requirement being that the visitation serve the best interest of 
              the child.</font></b></p>

              that court to grant such visitation rights whenever �visitation 
              may serve the best interest of the child.� Petitioners Jenifer and 
              Gary Troxel petitioned a Washington Superior Court for the right 
              to visit their grandchildren, Isabelle and Natalie Troxel. 
              Respondent Tommie Granville, the mother of Isabelle and Natalie, 
              opposed the petition. The case ultimately reached the Washington 
              Supreme Court, which held that �26.10.160(3) unconstitutionally 
              interferes with the fundamental right of parents to rear their 
              children.</font><font size="2"> </font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tommie Granville and Brad 
              Troxel shared a relationship that ended in June 1991. The two 
              never married, but they had two daughters, Isabelle and Natalie. 
              Jenifer and Gary Troxel are Brad�s parents, and thus the paternal 
              grandparents of Isabelle and Natalie. After Tommie and Brad 
              separated in 1991, Brad lived with his parents and regularly 
              brought his daughters to his parents� home for weekend visitation. 
              Brad committed suicide in May 1993. Although the Troxels at first 
              continued to see Isabelle and Natalie on a regular basis after 
              their son�s death, Tommie Granville informed the Troxels in 
              October 1993 that she wished to limit their visitation with her 
              daughters to one short visit per month. <i>In&nbsp;re Smith</i>, 137

              Wash. App. 131, 133, 940 P.2d 698, 698�699 (1997).</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1993, the Troxels 
              commenced the present action by filing, in the Washington Superior 
              Court for Skagit County, a petition to obtain visitation rights 
              with Isabelle and Natalie. The Troxels filed their petition under 
              two Washington statutes, Wash. Rev. Code ��26.09.240 and 
              26.10.160(3) (1994). Only the latter statute is at issue in this 
              case. Section 26.10.160(3) provides: �Any person may petition the 
              court for visitation rights at any time including, but not limited 
              to, custody proceedings. The court may order visitation rights for 
              any person when visitation may serve the best interest of the 
              child whether or not there has been any change of circumstances.� 
              At trial, the Troxels requested two weekends of overnight 
              visitation per month and two weeks of visitation each summer. 
              Granville did not oppose visitation altogether, but instead asked 
              the court to order one day of visitation per month with no 
              overnight stay. 87 Wash. App., at 133�134, 940 P.2d, at 699. In 
              1995, the Superior Court issued an oral ruling and entered a 
              visitation decree ordering visitation one weekend per month, one 
              week during the summer, and four hours on both of the petitioning 
              grandparents� birthdays. 137 Wash. 2d, at 6, 969 P.2d, at 23; App.

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granville appealed, during 
              which time she married Kelly Wynn. Before addressing the merits of 
              Granville�s appeal, the Washington Court of Appeals remanded the 
              case to the Superior Court for entry of written findings of fact 
              and conclusions of law. 137 Wash.2d, at 6, 969 P.2d, at 23. On 
              remand, the Superior Court found that visitation was in Isabelle 
              and Natalie�s best interests:</font></b></p>

              the areas of cousins and music.</font></b></p>

              would be benefitted from spending quality time with the 
              Petitioners, provided that that time is balanced with time with 
              the childrens� <i>[sic]</i> nuclear family. The court finds that

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Washington Court of Appeals 
              reversed the lower court�s visitation order and dismissed the

              standing to seek visitation under �26.10.160(3) unless a custody 
              action is pending. In the Court of Appeals� view, that limitation 
              on nonparental visitation actions was �consistent with the 
              constitutional restrictions on state interference with parents� 
              fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management 
              of their children.� 87 Wash. App., at 135, 940 P.2d, at 700 
              (internal quotation marks omitted). Having resolved the case on 
              the statutory ground, however, the Court of Appeals did not 
              expressly pass on Granville�s constitutional challenge to the 
              visitation statute. <i>Id.</i>, at 138, 940 P.2d, at 701.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Washington Supreme Court 
              granted the Troxels� petition for review and, after consolidating 
              their case with two other visitation cases, affirmed. The court 
              disagreed with the Court of Appeals� decision on the statutory 
              issue and found that the plain language of �26.10.160(3) gave the 
              Troxels standing to seek visitation, irrespective of whether a 
              custody action was pending. 137 Wash. 2d, at 12, 969 P.2d, at 
              26�27. The Washington Supreme Court nevertheless agreed with the 
              Court of Appeals� ultimate conclusion that the Troxels could not 
              obtain visitation of Isabelle and Natalie pursuant to 
              �26.10.160(3). The court rested its decision on the Federal 
              Constitution, holding that �26.10.160(3) unconstitutionally 
              infringes on the fundamental right of parents to rear their 
              children. In the court�s view, there were at least two problems 
              with the nonparental visitation statute. First, according to the 
              Washington Supreme Court, the Constitution permits a State to 
              interfere with the right of parents to rear their children only to 
              prevent harm or potential harm to a child. Section 26.10.160(3) 
              fails that standard because it requires no threshold showing of 
              harm. <i>Id.</i>, at 15�20, 969 P.2d, at 28�30. Second, by 
              allowing �&nbsp;�any person� to petition for forced visitation of a 
              child at �any time� with the only requirement being that the 
              visitation serve the best interest of the child,� the Washington 
              visitation statute sweeps too broadly. <i>Id.</i>, at 20, 969 
              P.2d, at 30. �It is not within the province of the state to make 
              significant decisions concerning the custody of children merely 
              because it could make a �better� decision.� <i>Ibid.</i>, 969 
              P.2d, at 31. The Washington Supreme Court held that �[p]arents 
              have a right to limit visitation of their children with third 
              persons,� and that between parents and judges, �the parents should 
              be the ones to choose whether to expose their children to certain 
              people or ideas.� <i>Id.</i>, at 21, 969 P.2d, at 31. Four 
              justices dissented from the Washington Supreme Court�s holding on 
              the constitutionality of the statute. <i>Id.</i>, at 23�43, 969

              past century make it difficult to speak of an average American 
              family. The composition of families varies greatly from household 
              to household. While many children may have two married parents and 
              grandparents who visit regularly, many other children are raised 
              in single-parent households. In 1996, children living with only 
              one parent accounted for 28 percent of all children under age 18 
              in the United States. U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, 
              Current Population Reports, 1997 Population Profile of the United 
              States 27 (1998). Understandably, in these single-parent 
              households, persons outside the nuclear family are called upon 
              with increasing frequency to assist in the everyday tasks of child 
              rearing. In many cases, grandparents play an important role. For 
              example, in 1998, approximately 4 million children�or 5.6 percent 
              of all children under age 18�lived in the household of their 
              grandparents. U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Current 
              Population Reports, Marital Status and Living Arrangements: March

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nationwide enactment of 
              nonparental visitation statutes is assuredly due, in some part, to 
              the States� recognition of these changing realities of the 
              American family. Because grandparents and other relatives 
              undertake duties of a parental nature in many households, States 
              have sought to ensure the welfare of the children therein by 
              protecting the relationships those children form with such third 
              parties. The States� nonparental visitation statutes are further 
              supported by a recognition, which varies from State to State, that 
              children should have the<br>
              opportunity to benefit from relationships with statutorily 
              specified persons�for example, their grandparents. The extension 
              of statutory rights in this area to persons other than a child�s 
              parents, however, comes with an obvious cost. For example, the 
              State�s recognition of an independent third-party interest in a 
              child can place a substantial burden on the traditional 
              parent-child relationship. Contrary to Justice Stevens� 
              accusation, our description of state nonparental visitation 
              statutes in these terms, of course, is not meant to suggest that 
              �children are so much chattel.� <i>Post</i>, at 10 (dissenting 
              opinion). Rather, our terminology is intended to highlight the 
              fact that these statutes can present questions of constitutional 
              import. In this case, we are presented with just such a question. 
              Specifically, we are asked to decide whether �26.10.160(3), as 
              applied to Tommie Granville and her family, violates the Federal 
              Constitution.</font></b></p>

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 26.10.160(3), as 
              applied to Granville and her family in this case, 
              unconstitutionally infringes on that fundamental parental right. 
              The Washington nonparental visitation statute is breathtakingly 
              broad. According to the statute�s text, �<i>[a]ny person</i> may 
              petition the court for visitation rights <i>at any time</i>,� and 
              the court may grant such visitation rights whenever �visitation 
              may serve <i>the best interest of the child</i>.� �26.10.160(3) 
              (emphases added). That language effectively permits any third 
              party seeking visitation to subject any decision by a parent 
              concerning visitation of the parent�s children to state-court 
              review. Once the visitation petition has been filed in court and 
              the matter is placed before a judge, a parent�s decision that 
              visitation would not be in the child�s best interest is accorded 
              no deference. Section 26.10.160(3) contains no requirement that a 
              court accord the parent�s decision any presumption of validity or 
              any weight whatsoever. Instead, the Washington statute places the 
              best-interest determination solely in the hands of the judge. 
              Should the judge disagree with the parent�s estimation of the 
              child�s best interests, the judge�s view necessarily prevails. 
              Thus, in practical effect, in the State of Washington a court can 
              disregard and overturn <i>any</i> decision by a fit custodial 
              parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by 
              the decision files a visitation petition, based solely on the 
              judge�s determination of the child�s best interests. The 
              Washington Supreme Court had the opportunity to give �26.10.160(3) 
              a narrower reading, but it declined to do so. See, <i>e.g.</i>, 
              137 Wash. 2d, at 5, 969 P.2d, at 23 (�[The statute] allow[s] any 
              person, at any time, to petition for visitation without regard to 
              relationship to the child, without regard to changed 
              circumstances, and without regard to harm�); <i>id.</i>, at 20, 
              969 P.2d, at 30 (�[The statute] allow[s] �any person� to petition

              requirement being that the visitation serve the best interest of 
              the child�).</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the facts of this 
              case, the record reveals that the Superior Court�s order was based

              and nothing more. The Superior Court�s order was not founded on 
              any special factors that might justify the State�s interference 
              with Granville�s fundamental right to make decisions concerning 
              the rearing of her two daughters. To be sure, this case involves a 
              visitation petition filed by grandparents soon after the death of 
              their son�the father of Isabelle and Natalie�but the combination

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Troxels did not 
              allege, and no court has found, that Granville was an unfit 
              parent. That aspect of the case is important, for there is a 
              presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their 
              children. As this Court explained in <i>Parham</i>:</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">�[O]ur constitutional system long 
              ago rejected any notion that a child is the mere creature of the 
              State and, on the contrary, asserted that parents generally have 
              the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare 
              [their children] for additional obligations. � The law�s concept 
              of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a 
              child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment 
              required for making life�s difficult decisions. More important, 
              historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection 
              lead parents to act in the best interests of their children.� 442

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Accordingly, so long as a parent 
              adequately cares for his or her children (<i>i.e.</i>, is fit), 
              there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself 
              into the private realm of the family to further question the 
              ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the 
              rearing of that parent�s children. See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Flores</i>,

              the Washington Superior Court intervened, but that when it did so, 
              it gave no special weight at all to Granville�s determination of 
              her daughters� best interests. More importantly, it appears that 
              the Superior Court applied exactly the opposite presumption. In 
              reciting its oral ruling after the conclusion of closing 
              arguments, the Superior Court judge explained:</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">�The burden is to show that it is 
              in the best interest of the children to have some visitation and

              situations a commonsensical approach [is that] it is normally in 
              the best interest of the children to spend quality time with the 
              grandparent, unless the grandparent, <i>[sic]</i> there are some 
              issues or problems involved wherein the grandparents, their

              placed on Granville, the fit custodial parent, the burden of <i>
              disproving</i> that visitation would be in the best interest of 
              her daughters. The judge reiterated moments later: �I think 
              [visitation with the Troxels] would be in the best interest of the 
              children and I haven�t been shown it is not in [the] best interest

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decisional framework 
              employed by the Superior Court directly contravened the

              602. In that respect, the court�s presumption failed to provide 
              any protection for Granville�s fundamental constitutional right to 
              make decisions concerning the rearing of her own daughters. Cf.,
              <i>e.g.</i>, Cal. Fam. Code Ann. �3104(e) (West 1994) (rebuttable

              court-ordered grandparental visitation unless the parents are 
              first able to prove such visitation is not in the best interests 
              of their minor child�). In an ideal world, parents might always 
              seek to cultivate the bonds between grandparents and their 
              grandchildren. Needless to say, however, our world is far from 
              perfect, and in it the decision whether such an intergenerational 
              relationship would be beneficial in any specific case is for the 
              parent to make in the first instance. And, if a fit parent�s 
              decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial 
              review, the court must accord at least some special weight to the 
              parent�s own determination.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we note that there is 
              no allegation that Granville ever sought to cut off visitation 
              entirely. Rather, the present dispute originated when Granville 
              informed the Troxels that she would prefer to restrict their 
              visitation with Isabelle and Natalie to one short visit per month 
              and special holidays. See 87 Wash. App., at 133, 940 P.2d, at 699; 
              Verbatim Report 12. In the Superior Court proceedings Granville 
              did not oppose visitation but instead asked that the duration of 
              any visitation order be shorter than that requested by the Troxels. 
              While the Troxels requested two weekends per month and two full 
              weeks in the summer, Granville asked the Superior Court to order 
              only one day of visitation per month (with no overnight stay) and 
              participation in the Granville family�s holiday celebrations. See 
              87 Wash. App., at 133, 940 P.2d, at 699; Verbatim Report 9 (�Right 
              off the bat we�d like to say that our position is that grandparent 
              visitation is in the best interest of the children. It is a matter 
              of how much and how it is going to be structured�) (opening 
              statement by Granville�s attorney). The Superior Court gave no 
              weight to Granville�s having assented to visitation even before 
              the filing of any visitation petition or subsequent court 
              intervention. The court instead rejected Granville�s proposal and 
              settled on a middle ground, ordering one weekend of visitation per 
              month, one week in the summer, and time on both of the petitioning 
              grandparents� birthdays. See 87 Wash. App., at 133�134, 940 P.2d, 
              at 699; Verbatim Report 216�221. Significantly, many other States 
              expressly provide by statute that courts may not award visitation 
              unless a parent has denied (or unreasonably denied) visitation to 
              the concerned third party. See, <i>e.g.</i>, Miss. Code Ann. 
              �93�16�3(2)(a) (1994) (court must find that �the parent or 
              custodian of the child unreasonably denied the grandparent 
              visitation rights with the child�); Ore. Rev. Stat. �109.121(1)(a)(B) 
              (1997) (court may award visitation if the �custodian of the child 
              has denied the grandparent reasonable opportunity to visit the 
              child�); R.&nbsp;I. Gen. Laws �15�5�24.3(a)(2)(iii)�(iv) (Supp. 1999) 
              (court must find that parents prevented grandparent from visiting 
              grandchild and that �there is no other way the petitioner is able 
              to visit his or her grandchild without court intervention�).</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considered together with the 
              Superior Court�s reasons for awarding visitation to the Troxels, 
              the combination of these factors demonstrates that the visitation 
              order in this case was an unconstitutional infringement on 
              Granville�s fundamental right to make decisions concerning the 
              care, custody, and control of her two daughters. The Washington 
              Superior Court failed to accord the determination of Granville, a 
              fit custodial parent, any material weight. In fact, the Superior 
              Court made only two formal findings in support of its visitation 
              order. First, the Troxels �are part of a large, central, loving 
              family, all located in this area, and the [Troxels] can provide 
              opportunities for the children in the areas of cousins and music.� 
              App. 70a. Second, �[t]he children would be benefitted from 
              spending quality time with the [Troxels], provided that that time 
              is balanced with time with the childrens� <i>[sic]</i> nuclear 
              family.� <i>Ibid.</i> These slender findings, in combination with 
              the court�s announced presumption in favor of grandparent 
              visitation and its failure to accord significant weight to 
              Granville�s already having offered meaningful visitation to the 
              Troxels, show that this case involves nothing more than a simple 
              disagreement between the Washington Superior Court and Granville 
              concerning her children�s best interests. The Superior Court�s 
              announced reason for ordering one week of visitation in the summer 
              demonstrates our conclusion well: �I look back on some personal 
              experiences �&nbsp;. We always spen[t] as kids a week with one set of 
              grandparents and another set of grandparents, [and] it happened to 
              work out in our family that [it] turned out to be an enjoyable 
              experience. Maybe that can, in this family, if that is how it 
              works out.� Verbatim Report 220�221. As we have explained, the Due 
              Process Clause does not permit a State to infringe on the 
              fundamental right of parents to make childrearing decisions simply 
              because a state judge believes a �better� decision could be made. 
              Neither the Washington nonparental visitation statute 
              generally�which places no limits on either the persons who may 
              petition for visitation or the circumstances in which such a 
              petition may be granted�nor the Superior Court in this specific 
              case required anything more. Accordingly, we hold that 
              �26.10.160(3), as applied in this case, is unconstitutional.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we rest our decision on 
              the sweeping breadth of �26.10.160(3) and the application of that 
              broad, unlimited power in this case, we do not consider the 
              primary constitutional question passed on by the Washington 
              Supreme Court�whether the Due Process Clause requires all 
              nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm or 
              potential harm to the child as a condition precedent to granting 
              visitation. We do not, and need not, define today the precise 
              scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context. 
              In this respect, we agree with Justice Kennedy that the 
              constitutionality of any standard for awarding visitation turns on 
              the specific manner in which that standard is applied and that the 
              constitutional protections in this area are best �elaborated with 
              care.� <i>Post</i>, at 9 (dissenting opinion). Because much 
              state-court adjudication in this context occurs on a case-by-case 
              basis, we would be hesitant to hold that specific nonparental 
              visitation statutes violate the Due Process Clause as a <i>per se</i> 
              matter.<sup><a href="#FN1" name="FN1SRC">1</a></sup> See, <i>e.g.</i>,
              <i>Fairbanks</i> v. <i>McCarter</i>, 330 Md. 39, 49�50, 622 A.&nbsp;2d 
              121, 126�127 (1993) (interpreting best-interest standard in

              nonparental visitation statute to require finding of harm as 
              condition precedent to awarding visitation).</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice Stevens criticizes our 
              reliance on what he characterizes as merely �a guess� about the 
              Washington courts� interpretation of �26.10.160(3). <i>Post</i>, 
              at 2. Justice Kennedy likewise states that �[m]ore specific 
              guidance should await a case in which a State�s highest court has 
              considered all of the facts in the course of elaborating the 
              protection afforded to parents by the laws of the State and by the 
              Constitution itself.� <i>Post</i>, at 10. We respectfully 
              disagree. There is no need to hypothesize about how the Washington 
              courts <i>might</i> apply �26.10.160(3) because the Washington 
              Superior Court <i>did</i> apply the statute in this very case. 
              Like the Washington Supreme Court, then, we are presented with an 
              actual visitation order and the reasons why the Superior Court 
              believed entry of the order was appropriate in this case. Faced 
              with the Superior Court�s application of �26.10.160(3) to 
              Granville and her family, the Washington Supreme Court chose not 
              to give the statute a narrower construction. Rather, that court 
              gave �26.10.160(3) a literal and expansive interpretation. As we 
              have explained, that broad construction plainly encompassed the 
              Superior Court�s application of the statute. See <i>supra</i>, at 
              8�9.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is thus no reason to 
              remand the case for further proceedings in the Washington Supreme 
              Court. As Justice Kennedy recognizes, the burden of litigating a 
              domestic relations proceeding can itself be �so disruptive of the 
              parent-child relationship that the constitutional right of a 
              custodial parent to make certain basic determinations for the 
              child�s welfare becomes implicated.� <i>Post</i> at 9. In this 
              case, the litigation costs incurred by Granville on her trip 
              through the Washington court system and to this Court are without 
              a doubt already substantial. As we have explained, it is apparent 
              that the entry of the visitation order in this case violated the 
              Constitution. We should say so now, without forcing the parties 
              into additional litigation that would further burden Granville�s 
              parental right. We therefore hold that the application of 
              �26.10.160(3) to Granville and her family violated her due process 
              right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of this settled 
              principle, the Supreme Court of Washington invalidated its statute 
              because it authorized a contested visitation order at the 
              intrusive behest of any person at any time subject only to a 
              best-interests-of-the-child standard. In construing the statute, 
              the state court explained that the �any person� at �any time� 
              language was to be read literally, at 137 Wash. 2d, at 10�11, 969 
              P.2d, at 25�27, and that �[m]ost notably the statut[e] do[es] not 
              require the petitioner to establish that he or she has a 
              substantial relationship with the child,� <i>id.</i>, at 20�21, 
              969 P.2d, at 31. Although the statute speaks of granting 
              visitation rights whenever �visitation may serve the best interest 
              of the child,� Wash. Rev. Code �26.10.160(3) (1994), the state 
              court authoritatively read this provision as placing hardly any 
              limit on a court�s discretion to award visitation rights. As the 
              court understood it, the specific best-interests provision in the 
              statute would allow a court to award visitation whenever it 
              thought it could make a better decision than a child�s parent had 
              done. See 137 Wash. 2d, at 20, 969 P.2d, at 31 (�It is not within 
              the province of the state to make significant decisions concerning 
              the custody of children merely because it could make a �better� 
              decision�).<sup><a href="#FN2" name="FN2SRC">2</a></sup> On that 
              basis in part, the Supreme Court of Washington invalidated the 
              State�s own statute: �Parents have a right to limit visitation of 
              their children with third persons.� <i>Id.,</i> at 21, 969 P.2d,

              repeatedly recognized right of upbringing would be a sham if it 
              failed to encompass the right to be free of judicially compelled 
              visitation by �any party� at �any time� a judge believed he �could 
              make a �better� decision�<sup><a href="#FN3" name="FN3SRC">3</a></sup> 
              than the objecting parent had done. The strength of a parent�s 
              interest in controlling a child�s associates is as obvious as the 
              influence of personal associations on the development of the 
              child�s social and moral character. Whether for good or for ill, 
              adults not only influence but may indoctrinate children, and a 
              choice about a child�s social companions is not essentially 
              different from the designation of the adults who will influence 
              the child in school. Even a State�s considered judgment about the 
              preferable political and religious character of schoolteachers is 
              not entitled to prevail over a parent�s choice of private school.
              <i>Pierce</i>,<i> supra,</i> at 535 (�The fundamental theory of 
              liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes 
              any general power of the State to standardize its children by 
              forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The 
              child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him 
              and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, 
              to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations�). It 
              would be anomalous, then, to subject a parent to any individual

              To say the least (and as the Court implied in <i>Pierce</i>),

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court today wisely declines 
              to endorse either the holding or the reasoning of the Supreme 
              Court of Washington. In my opinion, the Court would have been even 
              wiser to deny certiorari. Given the problematic character of the 
              trial court�s decision and the uniqueness of the Washington 
              statute, there was no pressing need to review a State Supreme 
              Court decision that merely requires the state legislature to draft 
              a better statute.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having decided to address the 
              merits, however, the Court should begin by recognizing that the

              holding a state law invalid on its face. In light of that 
              judgment, I believe that we should confront the federal questions 
              presented directly. For the Washington statute is not made 
              facially invalid either because it may be invoked by too many 
              hypothetical plaintiffs, or because it leaves open the possibility 
              that someone may be permitted to sustain a relationship with a 
              child without having to prove that serious harm to the child would

              a case is one that should be performed in the first instance by 
              the state appellate courts. In this case, because of their views 
              of the Federal Constitution, the Washington state appeals courts

              decide whether the statute had been correctly applied in this 
              case. In particular, the state court gave no content to the 
              phrase, �best interest of the child,� Wash. Rev. Code 
              �26.10.160(3) (Supp. 1996)�content that might well be gleaned from 
              that State�s own statutes or decisional law employing the same

              before a court may order visitation continued over a parent�s 
              objections�finds no support in this Court�s case law. While, as 
              the Court recognizes, the Federal Constitution certainly protects 
              the parent-child relationship from arbitrary impairment by the 
              State, see <i>infra</i>, at 7�8 we have never held that the 
              parent�s liberty interest in this relationship is so inflexible as 
              to establish a rigid constitutional shield, protecting every 
              arbitrary parental decision from any challenge absent a threshold 
              finding of harm.<sup><a href="#FN7" name="FN7SRC">7</a></sup> The

              child, a father�s due process liberty interest in maintaining some 
              connection with that child was not sufficiently powerful to 
              overcome a state statutory presumption that the husband of the 
              child�s mother was the child�s parent. As a result of the 
              presumption, the biological father could be denied even visitation 
              with the child because, as a matter of state law, he was not a 
              �parent.� A plurality of this Court there recognized that the 
              parental liberty interest was a function, not simply of �isolated

              broader and apparently independent interest in family. See, <i>

              with a child, and are tied to the presence or absence of some 
              embodiment of family. These limitations have arisen, not simply

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this Court has not yet 
              had occasion to elucidate the nature of a child�s liberty 
              interests in preserving established familial or family-like bonds, 
              491 U.S., at 130 (reserving the question), it seems to me 
              extremely likely that, to the extent parents and families have 
              fundamental liberty interests in preserving such intimate 
              relationships, so, too, do children have these interests, and so, 
              too, must their interests be balanced in the equation.<sup><a href="#FN8" name="FN8SRC">8</a></sup> 
              At a minimum, our prior cases recognizing that children are, 
              generally speaking, constitutionally protected actors require that 
              this Court reject any suggestion that when it comes to parental 
              rights, children are so much chattel. See <i>ante</i>, at 5�6 
              (opinion of O�Connor, J.) (describing States� recognition of �an 
              independent third-party interest in a child�). The constitutional 
              protection against arbitrary state interference with parental 
              rights should not be extended to prevent the States from 
              protecting children against the arbitrary exercise of parental 
              authority that is not in fact motivated by an interest in the 
              welfare of the child.<sup><a href="#FN9" name="FN9SRC">9</a></sup></font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not, of course, to 
              suggest that a child�s liberty interest in maintaining contact 
              with a particular individual is to be treated invariably as on a 
              par with that child�s parents� contrary interests. Because our 
              substantive due process case law includes a strong presumption 
              that a parent will act in the best interest of her child, it would 
              be necessary, were the state appellate courts actually to confront 
              a challenge to the statute as applied, to consider whether the 
              trial court�s assessment of the �best interest of the child� 
              incorporated that presumption. Neither would I decide whether the 
              trial court applied Washington�s statute in a constitutional way 
              in this case, although, as I have explained, n.&nbsp;3, <i>supra</i>, I 
              think the outcome of this determination is far from clear. For the 
              purpose of a facial challenge like this, I think it safe to assume 
              that trial judges usually give great deference to parents� wishes, 
              and I am not persuaded otherwise here.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But presumptions 
              notwithstanding, we should recognize that there may be 
              circumstances in which a child has a stronger interest at stake 
              than mere protection from serious harm caused by the termination 
              of visitation by a �person� other than a parent. The almost 
              infinite variety of family relationships that pervade our 
              ever-changing society strongly counsel against the creation by 
              this Court of a constitutional rule that treats a biological 
              parent�s liberty interest in the care and supervision of her child 
              as an isolated right that may be exercised arbitrarily. It is 
              indisputably the business of the States, rather than a federal 
              court employing a national standard, to assess in the first 
              instance the relative importance of the conflicting interests that 
              give rise to disputes such as this.<sup><a href="#FN10" name="FN10SRC">10</a></sup> 
              Far from guaranteeing that parents� interests will be trammeled in 
              the sweep of cases arising under the statute, the Washington law 
              merely gives an individual�with whom a child may have an 
              established relationship�the procedural right to ask the State to 
              act as arbiter, through the entirely well-known best-interests 
              standard, between the parent�s protected interests and the 
              child�s. It seems clear to me that the Due Process Clause of the

              Fourteenth Amendment</a> leaves room for States to consider the

              proclaims �all Men � are endowed by their Creator.� And in my view

              <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmentix">
              Ninth Amendment</a> says the Constitution�s enumeration of rights 
              �shall not be construed to deny or disparage.� The Declaration of 
              Independence, however, is not a legal prescription conferring 
              powers upon the courts; and the Constitution�s refusal to �deny or 
              disparage� other rights is far removed from affirming any one of 
              them, and even farther removed from authorizing judges to identify 
              what they might be, and to enforce the judges� list against laws 
              duly enacted by the people. Consequently, while I would think it 
              entirely compatible with the commitment to representative 
              democracy set forth in the founding documents to argue, in 
              legislative chambers or in electoral campaigns, that the state has
              <i>no power</i> to interfere with parents� authority over the 
              rearing of their children, I do not believe that the power which 
              the Constitution confers upon me <i>as a judge</i> entitles me to

              also�unless, as no one believes, the parental rights are to be 
              absolute�judicially approved assessments of �harm to the child� 
              and judicially defined gradations of other persons (grandparents,

              invalid, long-term guardians, etc.) who may have some claim

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I would

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of Washington 
              has determined that petitioners Jenifer and Gary Troxel have 
              standing under state law to seek court-ordered visitation with 
              their grandchildren, notwithstanding the objections of the 
              children�s parent, respondent Tommie Granville. The statute relied 
              upon provides:</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">�Any person may petition the court 
              for visitation rights at any time including, but not limited to, 
              custody proceedings. The court may order visitation rights for any 
              person when visitation may serve the best interest of the child 
              whether or not there has been any change of circumstances.� Wash. 
              Rev. Code �26.10.160(3) (1994).</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">After acknowledging this statutory 
              right to sue for visitation, the State Supreme Court invalidated 
              the statute as violative of the United States Constitution, 
              because it interfered with a parent�s right to raise his or her 
              child free from unwarranted interference. <i>In&nbsp;re&nbsp;Smith</i>, 137 
              Wash.&nbsp;2d 1, 969 P.2d 21 (1998). Although parts of the court�s 
              decision may be open to differing interpretations, it seems to be 
              agreed that the court invalidated the statute on its face, ruling 
              it a nullity.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first flaw the State 
              Supreme Court found in the statute is that it allows an award of 
              visitation to a non-parent without a finding that harm to the 
              child would result if visitation were withheld; and the second is 
              that the statute allows any person to seek visitation at any time. 
              In my view the first theory is too broad to be correct, as it 
              appears to contemplate that the best interests of the child 
              standard may not be applied in any visitation case. I acknowledge 
              the distinct possibility that visitation cases may arise where, 
              considering the absence of other protection for the parent under 
              state laws and procedures, the best interests of the child 
              standard would give insufficient protection to the parent�s 
              constitutional right to raise the child without undue intervention 
              by the state; but it is quite a different matter to say, as I 
              understand the Supreme Court of Washington to have said, that a 
              harm to the child standard is required in every instance.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the error I see in the 
              State Supreme Court�s central conclusion that the best interests 
              of the child standard is never appropriate in third-party 
              visitation cases, that court should have the first opportunity to 
              reconsider this case. I would remand the case to the state court 
              for further proceedings. If it then found the statute has been 
              applied in an unconstitutional manner because the best interests 
              of the child standard gives insufficient protection to a parent 
              under the circumstances of this case, or if it again declared the 
              statute a nullity because the statute seems to allow any person at 
              all to seek visitation at any time, the decision would present 
              other issues which may or may not warrant further review in this 
              Court. These include not only the protection the Constitution 
              gives parents against state-ordered visitation but also the extent 
              to which federal rules for facial challenges to statutes control 
              in state courts. These matters, however, should await some further 
              case. The judgment now under review should be vacated and remanded 
              on the sole ground that the harm ruling that was so central to the 
              Supreme Court of Washington�s decision was error, given its broad 
              formulation.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the question whether 
              harm to the child must be the controlling standard in every 
              visitation proceeding, there is a beginning point that commands 
              general, perhaps unanimous, agreement in our separate opinions: As 
              our case law has developed, the custodial parent has a 
              constitutional right to determine, without undue interference by 
              the state, how best to raise, nurture, and educate the child. The 
              parental right stems from the liberty protected by the Due Process

              considerable restraint, including careful adherence to the 
              incremental instruction given by the precise facts of particular

              to give content to the parent�s right by announcing a categorical 
              rule that third parties who seek visitation must always prove the 
              denial of visitation would harm the child. After reviewing some of 
              the relevant precedents, the Supreme Court of Washington concluded 
              �<fs fs="5" /> &nbsp;<fs fs="11" /> �[t]he requirement of harm is the

              abstract matter that in some sense the child is always harmed if 
              his or her best interests are not considered, the law of domestic 
              relations, as it has evolved to this point, treats as distinct the 
              two standards, one harm to the child and the other the best 
              interests of the child. The judgment of the Supreme Court of 
              Washington rests on that assumption, and I, too, shall assume that 
              there are real and consequential differences between the two 
              standards.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question whether one 
              standard must always take precedence over the other in order to 
              protect the right of the parent or parents, �[o]ur Nation�s 
              history, legal traditions, and practices� do not give us clear or 
              definitive answers. <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Glucksberg,</i>
              <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/sup-choice.cgi?521+702">
              521 U.S. 702</a>, 721 (1997). The consensus among courts and 
              commentators is that at least through the 19th century there was 
              no legal right of visitation; court-ordered visitation appears to 
              be a 20th-century phenomenon. See, <i>e.g</i>., 1 D. Kramer, Legal 
              Rights of Children 124, 136 (2d ed. 1994); 2 J. Atkinson, Modern 
              Child Custody Practice �8.10 (1986). A case often cited as one of 
              the earliest visitation decisions, <i>Succession of Reiss</i>, 46 
              La.&nbsp;Ann. 347, 353, 15 So. 151, 152 (1894), explained that �the 
              obligation ordinarily to visit grandparents is moral and not 
              legal��a conclusion which appears consistent with that of American 
              common law jurisdictions of the time. Early 20th-century 
              exceptions did occur, often in cases where a relative had acted in 
              a parental capacity, or where one of a child�s parents had died. 
              See <i>Douglass</i> v. <i>Merriman</i>, 163 S.&nbsp;C. 210, 161 S.&nbsp;E. 
              452 (1931) (maternal grandparent awarded visitation with child 
              when custody was awarded to father; mother had died); <i>Solomon</i> 
              v. <i>Solomon</i>, 319 Ill.&nbsp;App. 618, 49 N.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;2d 807 (1943) 
              (paternal grandparents could be given visitation with child in 
              custody of his mother when their son was stationed abroad; case 
              remanded for fitness hearing); <i>Consaul</i> v. <i>Consaul</i>, 
              63 N.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;S. 2d 688 (Sup. Ct. Jefferson Cty. 1946) (paternal 
              grandparents awarded visitation with child in custody of his 
              mother; father had become incompetent). As a general matter, 
              however, contemporary state-court decisions acknowledge that 
              �[h]istorically, grandparents had no legal right of visitation,�
              <i>Campbell</i> v. <i>Campbell</i>, 896 P.2d 635, 642, n.&nbsp;15 (Utah 
              App. 1995), and it is safe to assume other third parties would 
              have fared no better in court.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that third parties have 
              had no historical right to petition for visitation does not 
              necessarily imply, as the Supreme Court of Washington concluded, 
              that a parent has a constitutional right to prevent visitation in 
              all cases not involving harm. True, this Court has acknowledged 
              that States have the authority to intervene to prevent harm to 
              children, see, <i>e.g., Prince, supra</i>, at 168�169; <i>Yoder, 
              supra,</i> at 233�234, but that is not the same as saying that a 
              heightened harm to the child standard must be satisfied in every 
              case in which a third party seeks a visitation order. It is also 
              true that the law�s traditional presumption has been �that natural 
              bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of 
              their children,� <i>Parham</i> v. <i>J. R.,</i>
              <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/sup-choice.cgi?442+584">
              442 U.S. 584</a>, 602 (1979); and �[s]imply because the decision 
              of a parent is not agreeable to a child or because it involves 
              risks does not automatically transfer the power to make that 
              decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state,�
              <i>id.</i>, at 603. The State Supreme Court�s conclusion that the 
              Constitution forbids the application of the best interests of the 
              child standard in any visitation proceeding, however, appears to 
              rest upon assumptions the Constitution does not require.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My principal concern is that 
              the holding seems to proceed from the assumption that the parent 
              or parents who resist visitation have always been the child�s 
              primary caregivers and that the third parties who seek visitation 
              have no legitimate and established relationship with the child. 
              That idea, in turn, appears influenced by the concept that the 
              conventional nuclear family ought to establish the visitation 
              standard for every domestic relations case. As we all know, this 
              is simply not the structure or prevailing condition in many 
              households. See, <i>e.g</i>., <i>Moore</i> v. <i>East Cleveland,</i>
              <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/sup-choice.cgi?431+494">
              431 U.S. 494</a> (1977). For many boys and girls a traditional 
              family with two or even one permanent and caring parent is simply 
              not the reality of their childhood. This may be so whether their 
              childhood has been marked by tragedy or filled with considerable 
              happiness and fulfillment.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases are sure to arise�perhaps 
              a substantial number of cases�in which a third party, by acting in 
              a caregiving role over a significant period of time, has developed 
              a relationship with a child which is not necessarily subject to 
              absolute parental veto. See <i>Michael H.</i> v. <i>Gerald D.,</i>

              to identify persons who have a strong attachment to the child with 
              the concomitant motivation to act in a responsible way to ensure 
              the child�s welfare. As the State Supreme Court was correct to 
              acknowledge, those relationships can be so enduring that �in 
              certain circumstances where a child has enjoyed a substantial 
              relationship with a third person, arbitrarily depriving the child

              and harm to the adult may also ensue. In the design and 
              elaboration of their visitation laws, States may be entitled to 
              consider that certain relationships are such that to avoid the 
              risk of harm, a best interests standard can be employed by their

              many years as a basic tool of domestic relations law in visitation 
              proceedings. Since 1965 all 50 States have enacted a third-party 
              visitation statute of some sort. See <i>ante</i>, at 15, n. 
              (plurality opinion). Each of these statutes, save one, permits a 
              court order to issue in certain cases if visitation is found to be 
              in the best interests of the child. While it is unnecessary for us 
              to consider the constitutionality of any particular provision in 
              the case now before us, it can be noted that the statutes also 
              include a variety of methods for limiting parents� exposure to 
              third-party visitation petitions and for ensuring parental 
              decisions are given respect. Many States limit the identity of 
              permissible petitioners by restricting visitation petitions to 
              grandparents, or by requiring petitioners to show a substantial 
              relationship with a child, or both. See, <i>e.g</i>., Kan. Stat. 
              Ann. �38�129 (1993 and Supp. 1998) (grandparent visitation 
              authorized under certain circumstances if a substantial 
              relationship exists); N.&nbsp;C. Gen. Stat. ��50�13.2, 50�13.2A, 
              50�13.5 (1999) (same); Iowa Code �598.35 (Supp. 1999) (same; 
              visitation also authorized for great-grandparents); Wis. Stat. 
              �767.245 (Supp. 1999) (visitation authorized under certain 
              circumstances for �a grandparent, greatgrandparent, stepparent or 
              person who has maintained a relationship similar to a parent-child 
              relationship with the child�). The statutes vary in other 
              respects�for instance, some permit visitation petitions when there 
              has been a change in circumstances such as divorce or death of a 
              parent, see, <i>e.g</i>., N.&nbsp;H. Rev. Stat. Ann. �458:17�d (1992), 
              and some apply a presumption that parental decisions should 
              control, see, <i>e.g</i>., Cal. Fam. Code Ann. ��3104(e)�(f) (West 
              1994); R.&nbsp;I. Gen. Laws �15�5�24.3(a)(2)(v) (Supp. 1999). Georgia�s 
              is the sole State Legislature to have adopted a general harm to 
              the child standard, see Ga. Code Ann. �19�7�3(c) (1999), and it 
              did so only after the Georgia Supreme Court held the State�s prior 
              visitation statute invalid under the Federal and Georgia 
              Constitutions, see <i>Brooks</i> v. <i>Parkerson</i>, 265 Ga. 189, 
              454 S.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;2d 769, cert. denied,

              <p><b><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the inconclusive 
              historical record and case law, as well as the almost universal 
              adoption of the best interests standard for visitation disputes, I 
              would be hard pressed to conclude the right to be free of such 
              review in all cases is itself �<fs fs="5" /> &nbsp;<fs fs="11" /> 
              �implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.�<fs fs="5" /> &nbsp;<fs fs="11" /> 
              � <i>Glucksberg</i>, 521 U.S., at 721 (quoting <i>Palko</i> v. <i>
              Connecticut,</i>
              <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/sup-choice.cgi?302+319">
              302 U.S. 319</a>, 325 (1937)). In my view, it would be more 
              appropriate to conclude that the constitutionality of the 
              application of the best interests standard depends on more 
              specific factors. In short, a fit parent�s right vis-�-vis a 
              complete stranger is one thing; her right vis-�-vis another parent 
              or a <i>de facto</i> parent may be another. The protection the 
              Constitution requires, then, must be elaborated with care, using 
              the discipline and instruction of the case law system. We must 
              keep in mind that family courts in the 50 States confront these 
              factual variations each day, and are best situated to consider the 
              unpredictable, yet inevitable, issues that arise. Cf. <i>
              Ankenbrandt</i> v. <i>Richards,</i>

              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be recognized, of 
              course, that a domestic relations proceeding in and of itself can 
              constitute state intervention that is so disruptive of the 
              parent-child relationship that the constitutional right of a 
              custodial parent to make certain basic determinations for the 
              child�s welfare becomes implicated. The best interests of the 
              child standard has at times been criticized as indeterminate, 
              leading to unpredictable results. See, <i>e.g</i>., American Law 
              Institute, Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution 2, and n.&nbsp;2 
              (Tentative Draft No. 3, Mar. 20, 1998). If a single parent who is 
              struggling to raise a child is faced with visitation demands from 
              a third party, the attorney�s fees alone might destroy her hopes 
              and plans for the child�s future. Our system must confront more 
              often the reality that litigation can itself be so disruptive that 
              constitutional protection may be required; and I do not discount 
              the possibility that in some instances the best interests of the 
              child standard may provide insufficient protection to the 
              parent-child relationship. We owe it to the Nation�s domestic 
              relations legal structure, however, to proceed with caution.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should suffice in this case 
              to reverse the holding of the State Supreme Court that the 
              application of the best interests of the child standard is always 
              unconstitutional in third-party visitation cases. Whether, under 
              the circumstances of this case, the order requiring visitation 
              over the objection of this fit parent violated the Constitution 
              ought to be reserved for further proceedings. Because of its 
              sweeping ruling requiring the harm to the child standard, the 
              Supreme Court of Washington did not have the occasion to address 
              the specific visitation order the Troxels obtained. More specific 
              guidance should await a case in which a State�s highest court has 
              considered all of the facts in the course of elaborating the 
              protection afforded to parents by the laws of the State and by the 
              Constitution itself. Furthermore, in my view, we need not address 
              whether, under the correct constitutional standards, the 
              Washington statute can be invalidated on its face. This question, 
              too, ought to be addressed by the state court in the first 
              instance.</font></b></p>
              <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view the judgment under
