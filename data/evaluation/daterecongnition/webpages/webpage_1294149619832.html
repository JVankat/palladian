<p>Due to various problems that arose during the HTML conversion of this file, it was decided to put

the "science" sections, 3 and 4, into a separate file. This avoids some problems associated with the

total size of the file, while keeping the material most important for the spacegoing parts of the game together.

<a name=wb00><h2>0.0  Introduction</h2><a href=#contents>back to contents</a><p>

<p>This is the second in a series of science fiction source packs, aimed

mainly at users of table-top role playing games, but also of interest

to SF fans and scholars. It is not a computer game; I am simply using

shareware distribution as an alternative to printed publication. If

you have obtained it on the understanding that it is software, you are

STRONGLY advised to ask for your money back.



<p>Before looking at the rest of this document, I recommend reading the

<i>Astronef</i> stories by George Griffith. They are included in this

collection and should be read in the following order:<ol>



<p><li><a href="moon.htm">A Visit To The Moon</a>

<li><a href="mars.htm">The World Of The War God</a>

<li><a href="venus.htm">A Glimpse Of The Sinless Star</a>

<li><a href="jupiter.htm">The World Of The Crystal Cities</a>

<li><a href="saturn.htm">In Saturn's Realm</a>

<li><a href="homeward.htm">Homeward Bound</a></ol>



<p>All are illustrated by the graphics that accompanied their original publication, now including

the larger scans which were previously distributed with <b>The Astronef Collection</b>.



<p>This revised collection also contains the novelisation, <a href="honeymn.htm">A Honeymoon In Space</a>,

which was not a direct source for this worldbook, and unfortunately contradicts

it in many ways. While it would have been possible to make extensive revisions to bring reconcile the

game material and novel, there were so many practical problems that it was decided to leave things as they

are. In some respects the extra background described in the novel makes it a <i>less</i> interesting source than the stories, and

there are numerous contradictions between the stories and novel, including one outrageously unlikely example of parallel linguistic

development that can only have been added at the insistence of an extremely unimaginative editor.

With some exceptions mentioned below the stories are almost identical to chapters VI to XX of the novel; most of

the extra text is in the first five chapters.



<a name=wb01><h2>0.1  Scientific Romances</h2><a href=#contents>return to contents</a>



<p>In the beginning there was fiction. And fiction begat fantasy, stories

of people and places that did not exist. And fantasy eventually begat

the scientific romance, stories of the world that might emerge through

scientific invention and discovery. And scientific romance begat

science fiction - which promptly sealed itself into its own literary

ghetto and pretended that most of its predecessors had never really

been at all important!



<p>Scientific romances were the ancestors of science fiction, and are now

often difficult to find. They were usually set in the future, as it

was then visualised, and often had a strong Utopian flavour.



<p>The world portrayed in most futuristic scientific romances is simpler

and cleaner than the futures we imagine today, and full of wonderful

inventions. Some have been achieved, some look bizarre or quaint

today. For example, the "<i>Astronef</i>" stories feature some very dubious

science, but they also mention space suits, air locks, and other

inventions which were either imaginary or in their infancy when the

stories were written.



<p>A common feature was social prediction. Sometimes the story promoted a

particular moral or political system, and the background would be

slanted to show this belief in the best possible light. At other times

the author wanted to deliver a warning; these futures were much

darker, and sometimes (unintentionally) extremely amusing to readers

of a later era, and it's important to remember that their authors

usually intended them to be taken very seriously.



<p>The First World War saw such scientific horrors as trench warfare,

tanks, and poison gas, exploded the idea of technology as a sure

recipe for an Utopian future, and made it clear that change wasn't

necessarily going to be for the better. By the end of the war the

Utopian novel and scientific romances in general were in decline.



<p>The final blow came when science fiction was established as a separate

(and disreputable) literary ghetto. Many excellent authors suddenly

discovered that most of their markets were refusing to publish

speculative stories, or decided that their reputations would suffer if

they continued in this field. Early science fiction plundered the

ideas from scientific romances, usually without acknowledgement, and

reduced complex ideas to simple action plots which were often inferior

to their predecessors. For many years SF historians ignored all work

done before Gernsback's invention of "scientifiction" in 1926, and

some excellent works were ignored or forgotten.



<p>Today the distinction between SF and the scientific romance is

becoming blurred, especially when viewed by observers outside both

fields. All speculative writing tends to be tarred with the SF brush,

and consigned to a ghetto whose sole occupants (to outsiders) are

Tolkien and Star Trek. Within the SF community the "steampunk"

movement is starting to re-visit some Victorian themes, but a good

deal of excellent or influential work remains virtually unknown.



<p>One of my aims in the Forgotten Futures project is to make the

complete text of selected works available to a wider audience.

Griffith's writing is seldom seen; part of the third story was

included in the anthology "Farewell Fantastic Venus", and the entire

series of stories (plus some others by Griffith) was reprinted in

facsimile form in the anthology "The Rivals of H.G. Wells", but both

of these volumes have long been out of print. Some of his novels were

reprinted in the 1980s, but even the reprints are now very difficult

to find.



<p>These stories were originally published in Pearson's Magazine in 1900,

and expanded as a novel in 1901. The novelisation sets the scene before the first story (incidentally

mentioning that its events begin in 1900), extends the epilogue

slightly, and is a little more verbose, but in most other ways is

identical. Unfortunately I was unable to obtain a copy when writing the original

version of this worldbook, and afterwards learned that reconciling the two would

be very difficult, and in many respects would make the worldbook less usable as a

role playing source.



<p>Engravings by Stanley Wood accompanied each instalment, and I have

included them with each story. Wherever possible this worldbook

reflects the art as well as the written word.



<a name=wb02><h2>0.2  Language And Units</h2><a href=#contents>return to contents</a>

<p>The author of Forgotten Futures is British, as was George Griffith.

American readers will occasionally notice that there are differences

in spelling and use of language between our 'common' tongues. These

differences are made worse by the slightly dated English of these

stories. Hopefully most scanning errors have been corrected, but I

have otherwise stuck to the spelling used in the magazine printing if

an apparent mistake was repeated several times. This is most

noticeable in the names of astronomical bodies, where there were some

considerable variations in the 19th century. If that worries you, you

are welcome to run documents through a spell checker, but please DON'T

distribute modified versions.



<p>Griffith used Imperial measurements in the <i>Astronef</i> stories; ounces,

feet and inches, miles and horsepower. To retain the flavour of the

stories these units have been used where appropriate. Readers who are

unfamiliar with the older British and American system of weights and

measures will find the awful details in Appendix A of the rules,

which also explain pre-decimal British currency. The

spreadsheet template CURRENCY.WK1 accompanying the rules contains conversion routines.



<a name=wb03><h2>0.3  Role Playing Games</h2><a href=#contents>return to contents</a>



<p>This worldbook is largely written as a source for game referees, and

most sections contain notes for use with these games, or specifically

for the Forgotten Futures rules. I've tried to keep them as

unobtrusive as possible; usually they are boxed, in square brackets [like

this], or in separate sections of the text. There are fewer of

these interruptions than in the first Forgotten Futures worldbook,

because the <a href="advent2.htm">adventure campaign</a> covers a good deal of

ground and includes numerous ideas for continued adventures. A few

sections (especially those covering technology) are written mainly for

the game. The Forgotten Futures are on this disk, but

you are welcome to use the game of your choice, and add game

statistics to fit its rules. No one will complain provided you don't

try to publish a modified version of these files.



<p>The "history" in this sourcebook is written from a viewpoint in 1920,

but the adventure campaign begins in 1901, when the R. force is little

understood and the Solar System is wide open for exploration. Players

in a campaign beginning in 1901 need to know nothing of gravitational

technology, which in any case is thoroughly protected by patent, and

you may wish to keep some future "history" secret. In 1901 the Pilot

skill does not cover spacecraft, unless Lord Redgrave supplies the

training (which should NOT be readily available). By the end of the

decade this skill is much more common.



<p>The spaceship design sequence involves some moderately complicated

calculations for ship costs and performance. To make things easier a

Lotus-compatible spreadsheet template is also provided. If you and

your players aren't interested in this aspect of gaming, and just

think of ships as a means of transport, you might prefer to bypass

this section completely and use the <i>Astronef</i> or one of the "off the

peg" designs in section 3.6; after all, if characters have to worry

about the cost they probably can't afford it. Sections 3.1 and 3.2

"explain" R. force engines in enough detail to run the game, while

section 3.3 describes the main components.





<a name=wb04><h2>0.4  Writing Between The Lines</h2><a href=#contents>return to contents</a>



<p>The first Forgotten Futures worldbook extrapolated a hundred and fifty

years of history and technology from two short stories which gave very

few background details. In assembling this worldbook the main problem

has been deciding what to omit; the sheer wealth of material, both

text and illustrations, leads to occasional contradictions between the

different stories, and between the art and the written text. Most of

these problems arise in dealing with the science of the stories,

mentioned in more detail below, and in working out the physical layout

of the spacecraft <i>Astronef</i>.



<p>For example, the location of the <i>Astronef's</i> control room (sometimes

called the conning tower) seems to vary according to the needs of the

stories. To overcome these discrepancies I assumed that there are

actually two rooms - a small forward room used mainly for atmospheric

manoeuvres, and a conning tower (the funnel-like structure towards the

rear of the upper hull) used primarily for navigation in deep space. Some

of these assumptions were proven incorrect by details in A Honeymoon In Space,

but I have decided to leave things as they are in this worldbook and the

adventures. The hull as illustrated by Wood is narrower than that described by

Griffith; the result shown in the plans is a compromise.



<p>While Griffith did describe several worlds, his descriptions are

naturally from one viewpoint; that of the occupants of the <i>Astronef</i>,

who see very small regions of the worlds they visit, and are unable to

understand the languages of the aliens they encounter (except in one instance

in the novelisation, which I prefer to ignore). I have chosen

to assume that there is more to be learned on all of these worlds, and

on the worlds Griffith didn't visit, Mercury and the outermost

planets. Material which was invented specifically for this source-pack

is not marked as such; read the stories to find out how much I've

added.



<p>All of the "history" and most of the technology described below and in

the adventure has been invented for this collection; the original stories didn't

detail events before the flight of the <i>Astronef</i>, or carry the story

beyond its return, but it seems certain that the R. Force would lead

to a scientific revolution at least as important as the development of

nuclear power. For convenience the history below covers the last

decade of the 19th century and carries the story forward to 1920. It

borrows freely from several sources, most notably H.G. Wells' "The

Star". It is also written from a firmly British viewpoint, where

damage to London is a disaster, damage to Europe is a regrettable

incident, and damage elsewhere is hardly worth a footnote. These

attitudes are not necessarily those of the author. In many respects this material

is contradicted by A Honeymoon In Space.



<p>This period overlaps a very important time in the evolution of science

and of modern society; with the extra knowledge gained from Professor

Rennick's work, and from contact with at least one advanced alien

civilisation, decades of research might be bypassed or eliminated, and

society would surely see many changes. For this reason the language

used to describe R. force technology is that of 1920s physics, as

augmented by Ganymedan research.



<p>Some of my wilder extrapolations of hints in these stories may not be

fully justified; in particular, the "Zaidie hypothesis" is mainly

intended as an optional plotting device, a convenience to role-playing

referees, and can safely be ignored by other readers. My comments on

Lord Redgrave's personality are also highly suspect. The opinions and

philosophies described below are not necessarily those of the author.





<a name=wb05><h2>0.5  Weird Science</h2><a href=#contents>return to contents</a>



<p>Griffith used the best and most accurate scientific data available to

write his stories; much of it was subsequently proved to be wrong, but

that wasn't his fault!



<p>In 1900 many astronomers believed that life might exist throughout the

solar system. An important exponent of this theory was Nicolas

Flammarion, a French follower of Percival Lowell who promoted the

Martian canals and other "evidence" of life on different worlds.

Flammarion even believed that he had seen evidence of plant growth on

the Moon. His 'Popular Astronomy' was translated into English in 1894,

and had an enormous impact. It has certainly been read by the main

characters in these stories. Most of the information on conditions on

other worlds in these stories can be traced directly to Flammarion or

Lowell's work; unfortunately their opinions were often inaccurate. The

account of Saturn in the fifth story seems to be based on the work of

a British astronomer, Richard Proctor, who was also a prolific

populariser and lecturer. Again, some of the wilder guesses are

Flammarion's. Finally, there are a few silly mistakes, such as the

idea that it might be possible to "fall off" one of the moons of Mars,

which seem unlikely to have originated with either astronomer; I have

taken the liberty of blaming such errors on George Griffith, a

journalist hired to ghost-write the popular account of the first

voyage of the <i>Astronef</i>.



<p>The speed with which worlds are believed to age and die was a

widely-held theory. Before the discovery of the mass-energy

relationship, and the realisation that the Sun must be powered by the

disintegration of matter, the most optimistic estimates gave the Sun a

few million years of life. Referees should decide if this opinion is

correct; if so, nuclear fusion is not part of the solar cycle, and may

not occur at all. The latest events discussed below occur before any

form of nuclear power has been harnessed; the referee should decide if

radioactivity is a peculiar property of some materials, useless for

generating power or making bombs, or will eventually become as

important as gravity technology.



<p>The R. force could be justified by 19th century physics; since

magnetism and electrostatics both seemed to show the existence of

opposing fields or charges, there seemed every reason to believe that

gravity should follow suit. Unfortunately the stories include enough

details to preclude the idea of a field affecting the entire ship; it

is obvious that it is possible to create tightly-focused R. force

beams, and that different parts of the ship can be attracted or

repelled at the same time. This means that gravity must be carried by

suitably charged particles, or gravitons, with a negative or "R"

graviton for repulsion. For the purposes of this worldbook gravitons

of both types are easy to handle and isolate with the right equipment.

R. force engines are anti-gravitational rays, but the physics is

extremely dubious. It is unfortunately necessary to ignore or minimise

some minor problems such as G-forces, weightlessness, the origins of

the vast quantities of power used by these craft, and the fact that

the beams should rip normal matter apart via gravitational stress. DO

NOT explain how it all works in any detail. In a campaign set in the

early 1900s the best minds in the world are still grappling with the

problem; by 1920 a few scientists understand much more, but reaching

this point took the combined work of Rennick, Redgrave, Tesla, Bohr,

Einstein, and many others. Presumably the adventurers aren't in this

exalted intellectual league. If they are, they don't need to ask!



<p>Pluto doesn't appear to exist in the universe of the <i>Astronef</i> stories;

if it did, Lord Redgrave would know about it, given his unique

opportunities for observation and contacts with a race that have had

telescopes for thousands of years. Readers who disagree are welcome to

add lots of data; I haven't bothered since it looks like a singularly

dull place. For your convenience Pluto is included in the spreadsheet

template covering journey times. Some moons that weren't discovered in

1900 have also been omitted.



<p>Finally, it should be mentioned that the biology of the <i>Astronef</i>

universe suffers from fatal flaws, which cannot be covered by any

amount of "weird science"; similarities such as the layout of eyes,

nose, and mouth, and the arrangement of finger joints and other bones

in alien arms, can only be explained by common, close, and recent

ancestry or by direct act of an extremely conservative God. Even the

Saturnian sea serpents are far too like Terrestrial forms, and

extremely unlikely to evolve independently. Since Griffith did write

at least one story set in Atlantis, I have invoked ancient Atlantean

astronauts as an explanation for the worst example.



<p>This worldbook attempts to describe a universe that works by the laws

of nature known at the end of the 19th century, with the additions

found in these stories, and has astronomy and physics appropriate to

the ideas that were current in this period and the early 20th century.

In some cases it has not been possible to reconcile different parts of

the text without contradictions; where this problem arose I have

invented the science, regardless of internal consistency, and tried to

err in directions that would amuse the reader and provide useful

"hooks" for role playing campaigns.



<p>If the universe described in these stories seems strange, remember

that the real universe is stranger than we can possibly imagine. I

began writing this collection in 1993, and finished the original version in the week

of July 18th 1994; a week in which 21 comets hit Jupiter. If

any author had suggested that in 1900, no-one would have taken his

work seriously!

<p>The passages which follow are taken from the series "The Road To The

Stars" by Mark Lee, published by Pearson's Magazine in March-May 1920.

I am grateful to Mr. Lee and to Pearson's Magazine for permission to

<p><i>...From dust we come, and to dust we go. Too much dust out there. Why

isn't it adhering? Millions of years, and it just drifts in space.

...(illegible)... Electrical effects? Maybe, but surely some dust

would have an opposing charge, and start to adhere. Light might push

it, but there is light in all directions. What keeps it apart? Maybe

we assume too much. Must gravity always attract? ...(illegible)...

Could there be something pushing things apart? Call it the R. force, R.

for repulsive. It could explain Olber's paradox - make the universe

expand. There might be a paper in it...</i><br>

(From the notebooks of Professor Hartley Rennick, by courtesy of the

London Science Museum)



<p>In 1892 Professor Hartley Rennick first thought of a phenomenon now

known as the R. Force, or repulsive force. He reasoned that there was

strong evidence for the existence of dust in interstellar space, but

that (given many millions of years) all such dust should have been

attracted together by gravity, forming new planets and suns. Since

this was not the case, something must be negating gravity in the

interstellar dust.



<p>Rennick guessed that there were two forms of matter; normal matter,

attracted by gravity, and R. matter, or repulsive matter, which

exerted a corresponding repulsive force. Due to its nature there could

be very little R. matter on any planet; it would tend to disperse in

interstellar space. Olber's paradox (in brief, the fact that the night

sky is dark when an infinite number of stars should light it evenly at

all times) is also explained by the existence of R. matter; it repels

ordinary matter, and thus makes the universe expand.



<p>Rennick reasoned that the most likely source of R. matter on Earth was

the outer layer of meteorites, which might have struck R. matter

during their passage through space. Since R. matter would obey the

normal laws of chemistry, it could become embedded in the rock, or

fused to it by the impact. Using the most refined methods of

pulverisation and examination he eventually found several microscopic

flecks of dust which resolutely defied gravity, falling upwards as

fast as normal flecks fall downwards. This discovery initially seemed

to have no useful application, since the quantities of R. matter

involved would have barely supported a flea, let alone any useful

object. They were affected more strongly by Brownian motion than by

gravity.



<p>To summarise the extensive series of experiments that followed,

Rennick eventually proved that there are two forms of gravitational

particle, or graviton, differing only in sign. G. gravitons are found

in normal matter, R. gravitons in R. matter. Gravitons are continually

radiated and regenerated by atoms; the theoretical mechanism of

replacement is extremely complicated, but seems to be inexhaustible.



<p>For reasons which were then unclear (and are still extremely difficult

to describe without a lengthy digression into calculus and quantum

theory), all the gravitons attached to an atom must have the same

sign. If even one changes, the others will spontaneously "flip" to the

altered state. Rennick discovered that at extremely high voltages

particles of R. matter shed gravitons with enough force to "infect"

neighbouring atoms with the R. force, spontaneously regenerating the

gravitons they lost. This process slowly enlarged his original

samples.

Professor Rennick needs meteors and is prepared to pay for them.

Unfortunately several geologists are also after them, in pursuit of

their theories, and the price has gone sky-high. The adventurers

discover some particularly good specimens, and must play the bidders

against each other to get the best possible deal.



<p>This episode takes place at least four years BEFORE the flight of the

<i>Astronef</i>, and characters should not be aware of Professor Rennick's

identity or importance. Rennick is represented by an agent.</td></tr></table>



<p><i>...This man Rennick is a pest of the worst kind. I know that he's a

Professor, but he's not doing any professing around my workshops. If

he tries to see me again, show him the door.</i><br>

(Edison, talking to one of his technicians, quoted in the anthology

"Famous Fallacies")



<p>In 1898 Rennick constructed a demonstration gravitational engine.

Unfortunately his equipment was crude, with no means of storing

gravitons for extended periods, and the forces he could develop were

tiny, only detectable by the most sensitive balances. It was obvious

that engineering development was needed before there could be any

useful result. He tried to interest Edison but was dismissed as a

crank; a few days later the magazine Nature rejected his first paper

on the subject.



<p>Depressed, ill, and in need of a rest, Rennick took a vacation in the

Canadian Rockies, accompanied by his daughter Lilla Zaidie. There they

met Lord Rollo Lenox Smeaton Aubrey, the Earl of Redgrave, who was

enjoying a hunting holiday in the area. Lord Redgrave was strongly

attracted to Miss Rennick when he saw her. He initially used his

knowledge of engineering to scrape an acquaintanceship with the

Professor, mainly to have an excuse to be near her, but soon realised

that Rennick wasn't just an eccentric. Lord Redgrave had the money and

engineering facilities needed to develop the Professor's ideas, and in

less than a week they formed a partnership that was to change the

course of history. The <i>Astronef</i>, or star-navigator, would be built in

Lord Redgrave's works at Smeaton in Yorkshire, under conditions of the

strictest secrecy; Redgrave would finance and oversee construction,

with Rennick the brains behind the project. Miss Rennick was to stay

in New York, to complete her education and take care of their home.



<p>During the next year Professor Rennick developed all the essential

mechanisms of gravity control; graviton manufacture, storage, and

release, and a means of focusing gravitons to push away from an object

with enormous force. It was a staggering achievement, equalled only by

Einstein's evolution of his Grand Unified Theory in 1915, and it

should be noted that Einstein often said that without Rennick's

results he might never have reached a conclusion.



<p><i>...Professor Rennick is as well as can be expected, although I am

concerned about some respiratory abnormalities. He has allowed his

health to deteriorate badly, and is near to exhaustion. I must

strongly recommend that he takes some time to convalesce before

returning to work...</i><br>

(Note to Lord Redgrave, unsigned and undated)



<p>In 1899 the project received a near-fatal blow; the Professor died of

pulmonary complications following influenza, a victim of overwork and

the damp Yorkshire climate. His body was later returned to New York

for burial beside his wife. Today their tomb is an object of

pilgrimage for scientists the world over.



<p>At this point most of the remaining work fell into the realm of

engineering, rather than research, and Redgrave could carry on,

although some delays were inevitable. One handicap was the Professor's

nearly illegible handwriting, which Redgrave could only read with

extreme difficulty. Hundreds of pages were photographed and sent to

Miss Rennick in America; fortunately she could usually decipher the

scrawl, and gave invaluable help on several occasions.



<p>Throughout this period Andrew Murgatroyd, foreman of the works at

Smeaton, was the unsung hero of the <i>Astronef</i> project. He lived in the

works, always ready to lend a hand where it was needed, and prevented

several mistakes that would have been catastrophic in space. He was

later offered honours and other decorations, but refused all awards.

(Headlines from various newspapers, 1899-1900)



<p>Experts from every field of science were called upon to contribute

their ingenuity to different aspects of the project, with no idea of

its ultimate aim - one engineer's indiscreet description of airtight

asbestos suits led to wild rumours that Redgrave was building a

mechanical mole to travel to the centre of the earth, while the French

learned that he had ordered air purifying equipment, and were

convinced that he was preparing a submarine of a new and deadly

design. The works at Smeaton were besieged by the Press, curious

onlookers, and spies of various nationalities. Redgrave hired armed

guards to keep them out.



<p>When everything was ready Redgrave and Murgatroyd conducted a series

of tests, culminating in late-night flights over the North Sea and

Atlantic. On several occasions the <i>Astronef</i> was heard or sighted by

ships; while the R. force itself is completely silent, the propellers

which drove the <i>Astronef</i> through the air were quite noisy. Soon most

newspapers were running stories about mystery airships; somehow these

reports were never connected with Lord Redgrave's secretive

activities.



<p><table border cellpadding=10><tr><td><b>Scenario Idea, 1899-1900: U.F.A. (Unidentified Flying Airship)</b><br>

The adventurers are members of a society or government organisation

with an interest in unusual events and unexplained phenomena. Suddenly

there are dozens of reports of mystery airships over the North Sea,

and for once the Germans don't seem to know anything about it. What is

happening, and how will they investigate?</td></tr></table>



<p>Eventually Lord Redgrave summoned a representative of The Times to his

study and issued a curt statement, explaining that he had developed a

new form of transport and would give a full Press conference in New

York - later that day! He refused to answer any questions, or explain

how the <i>Astronef</i> worked.



<p>An hour later, to the tune of the works brass band and in the sight of

a large crowd, the <i>Astronef</i> flew publicly for the first time, circling

the yard then heading upwards into space. Redgrave simply took the

craft out several thousand miles then flew back again, reaching New

York an hour and forty-three minutes after he left Britain.



<p><b>"British Airship Crosses Atlantic In Two Hours!"<br>

"Redgrave's Repulsion Revelation!"<br>

"Honeymooners Head Heavenwards"</b><br>

(American newspaper headlines, 1900)



<p>Amongst the welcoming crowd was Lilla Zaidie Rennick. She and Redgrave

had been secretly engaged, but separated, for eighteen months. During

the last weeks the banns for their wedding had been read in the chapel

of the British Embassy, with great care taken to keep the news from

the Press. That night the editors of Redgrave's newspapers were

allowed to know the truth, and they scooped the world, announcing the

wedding and explaining that the newly-weds would spend their honeymoon

exploring the solar system. It was a sensation that almost eclipsed

the first news of the <i>Astronef</i>, and sent shares in Redgrave's

companies soaring.



<p>The wedding, held aboard the <i>Astronef</i> a mile above New York, was

attended by the British Ambassador, the Mayor of New York, and the

cream of society. Afterwards the <i>Astronef</i> landed a last time, to set

down its visitors, then set off for the Moon. The adventures that

followed are too well known to need elaboration; the best source for a

full account is the travelogue "Stories of Other Worlds", written by the

late George Griffith from Lady Redgrave's notes, and illustrated by

her sketches and photographs. It should be noted that Mr. Griffith was

not a scientist, and made several minor mistakes in his depiction of

the physics and use of the R. force and the details of space travel.

His subsequent expansion of these articles is best considered fiction.



<p>Most accounts of this period somehow suggest that nothing happened on

Earth while the <i>Astronef</i> was in space. Nothing could be further from

the truth. Within a month the works at Smeaton were laying down the

keel of the Hartley Rennick. This was to be a much larger ship, with

copious holds, accommodation for thirty, and mounts for six guns.

Since Redgrave didn't know what he might find on the voyage, he wanted

the next vessel to be easily adaptable to the widest possible range of

eventualities. The graviton plant at Smeaton was also hard at work,

preparing R. matter and R. gravitons for the <i>Astronef</i> and its

successor.



<p>Naturally most of the major global powers were alarmed by the

implications of the <i>Astronef</i>. While little was said publicly, all were

uneasily aware that the equipment that could lift a solid steel hull

might equally well be fitted into a warship, which could be sent to

raid inland cities. Even one flying dreadnought would be an enormous

military advantage. These fears, in the form they then took, were

almost groundless; it had taken the Smeaton works nearly a year to

synthesise enough R. matter for the <i>Astronef</i>, and it would have taken

another three years to generate enough for the Hartley Rennick if

later advances had not speeded the process considerably. Production of

gravitons for a battleship-sized warship would then have taken

decades, and even now takes a year or more.



<p>Four key figures now enter the story; Sir William Crookes, Admiral Sir

John Fisher, Thomas Alva Edison, and Nikola Tesla.



<p>Soon after the <i>Astronef</i>'s departure the British government approached

various scientific and military authorities and asked them to "look

into" military aspects of Rennick's discovery. The committee included

Crookes (then as now one of Britain's foremost physicists) and Fisher.

While newspapers were talking about flying warships, Crookes had

already realised that there were serious obstacles in the way of such

behemoths. Although Fisher was a strong proponent of the big gun, and

was eventually to modernise Britain's entire surface fleet with hugely

increased fire-power, he listened to Crookes and realised that the

military advantages of the R. force were speed and manoeuvrability;

for a long time R. matter would be in short supply, making weight a

major limitation. This meant that ships must be fast, small, and

equipped with lightweight weapons. If they could approach their

targets and attack before defences could be brought to bear they would

still be a formidable threat to any enemy.



<p>Recent memoirs reveal that a sizeable minority of this committee was

in favour of destroying the <i>Astronef</i> and all records of Rennick's

work. Fortunately it was obvious that it was already too late; once it

was known that the R. force existed, any competent physicist could

follow up the clues in Rennick's published papers and work towards the

same ends, avoiding many false trails and errors. Crookes' report made

it abundantly clear that the genie couldn't be pushed back into the

bottle, while Fisher recommended encouragement of Redgrave and the

earliest possible purchase of the technology for military use, so long

as the surface fleet was not compromised. This report is usually

considered the birth of the Royal Navy's space fleet. Britain built a

strong surface fleet, copiously armed against aerial attack, and a few

fast agile military spacecraft. America followed the British lead, as

did most of the continental powers. Only Germany made serious attempts

to build really large flying warships in this decade, and they were

remarkably unsuccessful.



<p>Edison may seem an odd person to mention; in the context of space

travel, he is mainly famous for refusing to help Professor Rennick

when he sought backing in 1898. However, he was also important as a

catalyst in the later story of the R. force. During his last Press

conference before the wedding, Lord Redgrave was asked why it took an

Englishman to develop an American invention. In replying, Redgrave

mentioned that Professor Rennick had tried to obtain American backing.

He didn't mention Edison's name, but the Press soon realised who he

had meant. When asked why he had turned down the professor, Edison's

comment was a snarled "didn't seem practical". Meanwhile his hired

detectives were hard at work, tracking down all possible information

on Rennick and the R. Force. Lady Redgrave's New York apartment was

burgled, but the intruders were caught as they were leaving. The

stolen papers made it obvious that they were not simple thieves, and

at first they were treated as spies. They implicated Edison in their

confessions; there was no proof, but from that moment on Edison lost

much of the support that he had previously received from the American

Press.



<p>A few years earlier Edison had fallen out with Tesla, who was

delighted to hear of his old enemy's problems. Tesla had previously

paid little attention to the <i>Astronef</i>, but this incident aroused his

curiosity. A photograph of the works at Smeaton showed the gigantic

graviton plant. Tesla studied the photographs, and the little

information he had on the process, reasoned out the mechanism, and

redesigned it for AC operation. There was a lengthy period of

confusion following the <i>Astronef</i>'s near-fatal crash landing, but in

October 1901 Tesla arranged an appointment and showed Lord Redgrave

his modified design. Redgrave wasn't convinced, but Tesla offered to

demonstrate the process and produce an ounce of R. matter within a

month if Lord Redgrave would supply a small sample to "seed" the

electrodes.



<p>Several weeks later a needle tipped with R. matter was delivered to

Tesla, who had meanwhile found an error in his calculations and

realised that he would need much more power than he had anticipated.

The only source available was the new generating plant at Niagara

Falls, built by his colleague George Westinghouse. Luckily

Westinghouse was already interested in acquiring the American rights

to the R. force, and was having trouble persuading Lord Redgrave to

agree terms. The Tesla process was the lever he needed to complete the

agreement. He and Tesla were the world's leading authorities on AC

generators; without them Lord Redgrave had little hope of making it

work. After some negotiation a partnership was formed, beginning a

long and profitable association. Tesla provided a steady stream of

improvements, while Westinghouse's combination of business sense and

engineering expertise made him the perfect counterpart to Redgrave.

All three were united in ingenuity and dislike of Edison, and through

their association R. Force Developments Inc. has become the most

profitable company in America.



<p>Meanwhile, at least ten nations were developing graviton technology.

Britain and America were in the lead, especially in the field of space

travel; other nations took some time to catch up, mainly because it

took many months to build up the stocks of R. matter needed for

large-scale production. Redgrave and the Americans reserved the bulk

of their production for their own projects, although "seed" quantities

of R. matter were made available to anyone who wished to build a

graviton plant and pay appropriate royalties. R. matter itself, as a

natural phenomenon, was not patentable, but every other part of the

process was thoroughly protected.



<p><b>"Make Moon Part Of The Empire"<br>

"Lunarians For The Zoo"<br>

"Are We Throwing Away Our Lead In Space?"</b><br>

(Newspaper headlines 1902-3)



<p>As 1902 began, the <i>Astronef</i> was still undergoing repairs; Lord

Redgrave had promised to lend her to the Army when she was airworthy,

but the African war ended first. Later she made several flights to the

Moon for archaeological and selenological investigations (which

eventually led to the huge mining complexes we know today), and to

collect plants and animals at Newton. With immense difficulty these

specimens were transferred to a special refrigerated enclosure at the

London Zoo, and their descendants can still be seen today.

Incidentally, it is untrue that Lord Redgrave attempted to catch a

Lunarian for the collection, as claimed in several sensationalist

articles; evidence in the case of Redgrave versus the Royal Society

for the Prevention Of Cruelty To Animals and Mr George Bernard Shaw

proved conclusively that great care was taken to avoid disturbing

these pitiful creatures.



<p>Patriots called for the Moon to be made part of the British Empire;

the motion was passed by both Houses of Parliament, and Lord Redgrave

formerly claimed it during the second expedition, but at this point

the <i>Astronef</i> was the only British spacecraft. By the time Britain had

a strong military presence in space, four other nations had bases on

the Moon. In view of the difficulty of maintaining a permanent

garrison Britain eventually agreed to refer the matter to the

international courts, where it still rests.



<p>The <i>Hartley Rennick</i> first flew towards the end of the year.

Unfortunately its propulsion system was woefully inadequate,

developing only a fraction of the anticipated power. Lord Redgrave

decided to limit it to flights in the atmosphere until the problem was

solved. The cause remained a mystery for several months, but

eventually proved to be due to the designers "scaling up" the system

wrongly, and using crystals that were far too small for the power

required. It then became apparent that two engines were insufficient

for such a large ship; two more were fitted, which necessitated a

lengthy series of modifications and design changes.



<p>One final event of 1902 was the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Lord

Redgrave. There was some criticism of the choice, since it was

generally agreed that Professor Rennick did the lion's share of the

theoretical work and would probably have been the sole recipient if he

had lived. There was also some disquiet about events on Mars. Lord

Redgave accepted the prize but used it to set up the Rennick

Scholarships (Physics, Astronomy, and Extraterrestrial Biology and

Linguistics) at Oxford and Harvard, which silenced most of his

critics.



<p>1903 saw the first completely successful trials of the Hartley

Rennick. The Redgrave yards also laid down keels for the Zaidie

Redgrave (a sister-ship of the <i>Hartley Rennick</i>, shorn of her

engineering problems) and Britain's first purely military spacecraft,

HMS <i>Nova</i>.



<p>HMS <i>Nova</i> was a radically odd design, with an angular hull shaped

somewhat like the blade of a chisel. Although she massed nearly 600

tons she was still much smaller than the other flying warships planned

at the time, with a total crew of 22. Nevertheless she cost over a

million pounds, more than most battleships of the era (but a tiny

fraction of the eventual cost of Germany's flying dreadnoughts). Her

first captain described her as "a cross between a brick and a

submarine", and this wasn't far from the truth. She was certainly as

cramped and uncomfortable as any submarine.



<p>While German plans saw indestructible flying fortresses raining down

death and destruction as they advanced inexorably towards their

enemies, British military designs were based on Crookes' and Fisher's

suggestions, and on the lessons learned from the first expedition to

Mars; the <i>Nova</i> was built to raid from space, using hit and run tactics

to avoid defences rather than confront them. Her two 8" guns were

fixed to fire forward along the axis of the ship, reducing their

weight dramatically and avoiding stability problems that were to

plague her rivals; they were aimed by aiming the whole ship at the

target, and their recoil was absorbed as a loss of the ship's

momentum. She also carried six 1000 lb bombs or three torpedoes.

Electrically-driven machine guns were rigged to fire to the sides and

aft at prodigious rates if she was ever forced to low altitudes, but

her defences were primarily speed, height, and manoeuvrability.



<p>These details were kept secret, and newspaper sketches showed her

flying at low altitudes and fitted with turrets. The relative

smallness of the <i>Nova</i> was widely criticised in Britain, and derided in

European newspapers (which didn't know about the difficulties other

shipbuilders were already encountering). France, Belgium, Italy, and

Russia were also building ships of similar sizes; all had turrets, and

were bigger, slower, and much less agile than the <i>Nova</i>.



<p><i>No Martian would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth

century that his world was being watched keenly and closely...</i><br>

(H.G. Wells: The War Of The Worlds, 1902 revision)



<p>In March 1904 the <i>Hartley Rennick</i> set off for Mars, carrying a

scientific team and several diplomats. The expedition was captained by

Lord Redgrave, but Lady Redgrave was expecting her first child and

stayed on Earth. The expedition spent a week on Phobos, observing Mars

from space, and eventually attempted to land near a city adjoining

Syrtis Major. The Martians immediately began a sustained aerial

assault; Lord Redgrave destroyed one of their flying ships, then

(under diplomatic pressure) ordered a retreat to space. Three more

landings were met by similar attacks. It became apparent that the

Martians had interpreted the <i>Astronef</i>'s visit as a scouting mission,

and spent the last four years arming to defeat an invasion from space.



<p>Given the Martian attitude, and the impracticality of an invasion

across the void of interplanetary space, the simple answer was to

leave the Martians to their own devices. The expedition did learn that

the Martians were using wireless signals, and linguists have spent

many hours attempting to decipher their language, so far without

success. The Martians seem to ignore any signals we transmit from

space.



<p>From Mars the <i>Hartley Rennick</i> carried on to Jupiter, returning to the

"glass-house" cities of Ganymede. The inhabitants were pleased to

welcome their new visitors, and willing to co-operate with

anthropologists, linguists, and other scholars. Progress was rapid; by

May some of the natives spoke English, and were sharing their

scientific knowledge with the explorers. Lord Redgrave was anxious to

return home for the birth of his child, while the scientists wanted to

remain on Ganymede and learn more. Eventually a compromise was agreed;

the scientists and diplomats stayed on Ganymede, guests of the city,

while the ship returned to Earth. Passengers on the return journey

included the first Ganymedan ambassador, Vlok Frul Rell Vorix, later

the Foremost of Ganymede, with his wife and servants.



<p>Lord Gordon Wellesley Redgrave was born in September; the <i>Hartley

Rennick</i> returned to Jupiter in January the following year. En route

the ship visited Ceres to collect specimens for the Zoo, and larger

samples of the strange "heavy water" of that world which were shipped

to Earth for use in experiments at the National Physical Laboratory

and Imperial College.



<p><table border cellpadding=10><tr><td><b>Scenario Idea, 1905 onwards: ...And Not A Drop To Drink</b><br>

If one of the adventurers is a scientist, why not "accidentally" lock

him into a store room over a long hot summer weekend. Unfortunately

the room is escape proof, and there's no sink. The only thing that

looks even vaguely drinkable is a bottle of Ceres water, which has

carelessly been left out of the safe. Is a dedicated scientist

prepared to drink this precious substance? What will the stuff do to

him if he does? Remember that a mouthful will weigh several pounds,

and might just possibly rip through the stomach lining on the way down

if you feel unusually sadistic...</td></tr></table>



<p>Another event of 1905 was the first flight of HMS <i>Nova</i>. Several other

nations were developing flying warships. Once the <i>Nova</i> had shown her

paces in space, and in attacks on ground targets and derelict ships,

it was obvious that she was superior in every way. Given the nature of

the R. force, and the need for speed and manoeuvrability, the turrets

most other ships carried were an almost insurmountable handicap. Later

European designs were modelled much more closely on the <i>Nova</i>.



<p>Germany alone continued to build flying dreadnoughts; too many

reputations, and too much money, were tied up in the idea, and no-one

seems to have been prepared to admit that they were obsolete before

they were even built. Even the primitive winged aircraft and airships

of the day could have out-flown them, and today's Ganymedan-designed

flyers would run rings around them. One eventual consequence was the

loss of the <i>Goethe</i>, a Prussian eighteen-gunner launched in 1912.

During trials it fired a broadside, lost its R. force "legs" from the

sudden recoil, and crashed and sank in the North Sea. Nearly a hundred

crewmen were killed.



<p>Once the <i>Nova</i> was in service, there were repeated calls for

retaliation against the Martians. The Navy was justifiably reluctant

to release HMS <i>Nova</i> for a prolonged campaign. Lady Redgrave's vision

of conquest (<i>"...we'd better go back and build a fleet like this, and

come and take it."</i>) ignored several practical problems that would

probably have resulted in a military debacle and immense losses. For

one thing, there was reason to believe that the air of Mars might be

poisonous on prolonged exposure, and it is obvious that Martian plants

are not based on the chemicals we know on Earth. It is difficult to

imagine an invasion succeeding if the invaders are permanently forced

to wear breathing dresses, and have to import all food across the void

of space. There is also a grave risk of the Martians acquiring our

technology from any ships they might capture. Today there is usually a

British or American warship somewhere near Mars, and it is illegal to

land or venture within the orbit of Phobos. There the matter still

rests. Despite the predictions of Wells we have still managed to avoid

carrying our colonial wars to Mars, and it is to be hoped that we will

never have to do so.



<p>Trade between Earth and Ganymede developed rapidly in 1905-7; the

Ganymedans are mainly interested in copper, nickel, iron, and other

metals for the machines that keep their cities habitable, while there

is an enormous demand for Ganymedan fabrics, scientific knowledge, and

art. With the aid of the Ganymedans exploration was greatly

simplified. Their cities could be used as staging posts for

expeditions to Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The second Saturn

expedition was mounted the following year, returning with a range of

useful drugs extracted from the bodies of Saturnian sea-serpents.

Meanwhile the first pressurised mines were opened on the Moon,

producing seventy tons of useful ores in their first year of

operation. Today annual production has risen to several thousand tons,

mostly of light metals such as aluminium and titanium, smelted in

solar furnaces during the Lunar day.



<p>On 30th June 1908 parts of Moscow were devastated by the impact of a

gigantic ice meteor. Wireless messages from <i>HMS Nebula</i> gave the first

warning a few hours before the event, but her guns and bombs were

powerless to deflect the icy projectile. An attempt to tow it clear of

the Earth might have succeeded, given more time, but time was not

available. Bare minutes before the asteroid struck, the <i>Nebula</i>

attempted to ram the asteroid and push it off course; there were no

survivors. Fortunately the Russian Court was at the summer palace near

St. Petersburg at the time, and no members of the Royal family were

killed. Today Moscow is largely rebuilt to modern standards, but much

of the Kremlin was destroyed and it will be many years before its

cathedrals are replaced. The officers and men of <i>HMS Nebula</i>

posthumously received the highest British and Russian awards.



<p><table border cellpadding=10><tr><td><b>Scenario Idea, 1909: Fallen Heroes</b><br>

Everyone aboard the <i>Nebula</i> was killed when it crashed into the

meteor.. but now the Germans claim that the Navy deliberately aimed

the meteor at Moscow, and that the <i>Nebula</i> wasn't really destroyed.

They say that without British intervention the meteor would have

crashed harmlessly in Siberia. Both Britain and Russia have ridiculed

the idea (remember that there are strong ties between the British and

Russian Royal families), but the Germans claim to have proof. Can it

be true; if so, what really happened to HMS <i>Nebula</i>, and why was Moscow

destroyed?</td></tr></table>



<p>1909 saw further exploration in space, including the first expedition

to Uranus (mounted at colossal expense, and producing few worthwhile

results), and a second landing on Venus, sponsored by the Anglican

Missionary Society against the wishes of Lord Redgrave. American

explorer Robert E. Peary led part of this expedition to Venus's North

Pole, finding it cooler than the equatorial regions visited by the

main expedition and the <i>Astronef</i>, but much warmer than Earth's Poles.

After six weeks on Venus the missionaries were still unable to

communicate with the natives, and split on the question of their

religious and social status. Meanwhile there were several meetings

between Lord Redgrave and the Archbishop of Canterbury; their content

has never been published, but eventually <i>HMS Capella</i> was dispatched to

Venus, carrying orders to withdraw the expedition. The disappointed

missionaries returned to Earth, while the <i>Capella</i> carried on to take

the first close look at Mercury, finding a seared rocky desert, a thin

but breathable atmosphere, and a restricted range of moss-like plants

and invertebrates resembling large Terrestrial arachnids. No higher

forms have been discovered. Exploration was hampered by extreme heat

and an almost complete lack of water.



<p>No-one aboard the <i>Capella</i> had geological training, so mineral samples

were loaded for analysis on Earth. Nothing very interesting was found,

apart from a scattering of curiously heavy violet crystals which

no-one could identify. There were so many that they were left until

last, on the assumption that they were too common to be valuable.

Eventually samples were sent to chemists at Imperial College, where

they were found to be a compound of gold and fluorine. Unfortunately

the scientists had not been warned that the matter was confidential,

and word soon got out.

Newspaper Headlines 1910-1912



<p>While several ships were already in service or under construction, the

Mercury find triggered the real rush into space. Eight keels were laid

down in five countries in the month after the find was publicised, and

another fourteen ships were under construction by the end of the

following year. Haste and greed led to two tragic accidents, but the

remaining ships were well-built and most are still in service. As the

crystals reached Earth a currency crisis seemed inevitable, but the

pioneers had underestimated the difficulties of extracting gold from

the crystalline form; it was an expensive and dangerous process which

consumed vast amounts of electricity and released clouds of toxic gas,

which reacted with water vapour to form strong corrosive acid. Workers

at the pilot plants on Earth suffered skin diseases, eye infections,

and respiratory problems, and the machinery began to break down as

corrosion took its toll. Demand for the crystals plummeted, and gold

shares soared. The Mercurian miners began to look for alternate ways

to make a living; less agile ships moved out to the asteroids and the

dead moons of Jupiter, others re-fitted to hunt the monsters of

Saturn. A few stayed on in the gold trade, despite very poor profits,

and were vindicated when Imperial Chemicals built a fully automatic

extraction plant on the Moon in 1912. Production was a little cheaper

than mining in South Africa or America, but expensive enough to keep

gold prices stable.



<p>1911-12 saw the continued exploration of the outer planets, most

notably the race to be the first to explore Neptune. Robert Scott led

the British expedition, Roald Amundsen the Norwegian. Both had spent

years exploring in the Arctic, but Amundsen recruited experienced

space crew, and tested his equipment in the cold of the Lunar night,

while Scott took a predominantly amateur team with minimal

preparation. In consequence the Scott expedition was plagued with a

series of mechanical breakdowns, and was forced to spend several weeks

re-fitting on Ganymede. When the ship reached Neptune the explorers

found that Amundsen had already been and gone, leaving instruments and

markers on Triton and Nereid. The planet itself resembled a colder

version of Uranus; Amundsen had wisely refrained from exploring its

atmosphere, but Scott took his ship into the depths. The result was

disaster; pipes froze, and the recycling equipment broke down and

could not be repaired. The expedition set off for Earth at maximum

speed, but it became clear that air would run out before it reached a

safe haven. Despite heroic sacrifices all died on the return journey,

their calm radio messages being the only record of what must have been

a desperate struggle for survival. Their ship, the <i>Discovery</i>, was

never recovered.

<p><b>Monsoon Floods Out Test Match<br>

Hundreds Killed As Dam Bursts<br>

Titanic Sunk<br>

London Evacuated!</b><br>

(Newspaper Headlines 1910-14)



<p>During 1905-1910 meteorologists began to notice an unprecedented

change of climate. Winters were warmer, summers wetter, and there was

an enormous rise in the number of icebergs sighted at sea, accompanied

by severe fogs and storms. It slowly became apparent that the ice caps

were shrinking. Ganymede was also experiencing unprecedented warmth,

and for months at a time the Martian surface was obscured by clouds.

In hindsight the source of this heat was obvious, but it was several

months before the facts were clear. The nova Lilla-Zaidie was to

blame.



<p>Lilla-Zaidie was kindled by the collision of two hitherto-unseen

planets between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. One has been

estimated as having approximately twenty times the mass of the Earth,

the other was much smaller but moving very quickly. The impact fused

them, releasing enormous heat. The combined bodies were still

travelling fast enough to escape from the Solar System, but the

collision deflected them into a cometary orbit which approached to

within three hundred million miles of the Sun in 1905, then extended

back into the depths of space (see <a href="20_nova.gif">20_NOVA.GIF</a>). By 1910 the star had

already passed the orbit of Jupiter again, and was approximately

twenty million miles above the plane of the ecliptic.



<p>While Lilla-Zaidie is a small star, and even at its closest approach

seemed little brighter than Venus, its radiance was powerful enough to

alter the balance between radiated and absorbed heat. Ironically,

meteorologists at the end of the 19th century had feared a new Ice

Age; in 1910 the average global temperature was four degrees higher

than usual, mean sea levels had risen by five inches, and coastal

regions throughout the world were threatened with flooding. At the end

of 1912 sea levels had risen nearly a foot, and Holland's dykes were

breached during a month of savage storms. Hundreds died before they

could be evacuated to higher ground. New Orleans was also flooded,

with thousands killed in the wake of Hurricane Beulah. Nearer the

Equator, it is estimated that at least a million natives were killed

by tropical storms. Worse was to follow; in November tides overtopped

the embankments of the Thames, and much of central London was flooded,

causing hundreds of millions of pounds of property damage and killing

dozens. Most of the underground railway system was flooded, and this

plus widespread damage to sewers, gas and water mains, and electrical

supplies meant that low-lying areas were uninhabitable even after the

waters receded. A new outbreak of typhus added a fearsome death toll

amongst the poorer classes. Another British loss was the liner

Titanic, sunk by one of the hundreds of icebergs that now made all

oceans hazardous to shipping.



<p>As the oceans rose, flyers of all types became increasingly important,

a lifeline to areas isolated by flooding and storms. In all civilised

nations there was a move towards higher ground; Britain's new Houses

of Parliament are, of course, on Parliament Hill, while the King's new

London residence is a modest mansion on Primrose Hill.



<p>While the events of this period seemed to be dominated by the rapidly

rising waters, it should be remembered that in many areas life

continued as usual. As reported above, the exploitation of the Moon

and asteroids was continuing; if anything, the loss of coastal

resources spurred on the enterprise. Scientific developments also

continued; for example, in 1913 the Danish physicist Niels Bohr

published his atomic theory, which neatly explains how protons,

electrons, and gravitons fit into the atom. His work laid the ghost of

the so-called "neutron", although even today there are still a few

physicists who prefer to assume that this particle does exist. His

model (with some minor changes suggested by subsequent work) is

illustrated in figure <a href=13_atom.gif>13_ATOM.GIF</a>.



<p>Amidst the chaos of the floods, the loss of the research ship <i>Beagle

II</i> went almost unnoticed. Exploring in the asteroid belt under the

command of Ernest Shackleton, she was struck by a meteor which wrecked

both engines. Fortunately there was just enough power to make an

emergency landing on Pallas, an asteroid whose orbit occasionally

nears Mars. By rationing food and restricting all activities to a

minimum the explorers stretched their stores until they were within

extreme wireless range of Mars, then used the remains of an engine's

R. matter core to raise their radio aerial and signal for help.

Fortunately the American frigate <i>Orion</i> heard their call, and they were

rescued three days later.



<p><table border cellpadding=10><tr><td><b>Scenario Idea, 1914 onwards: Salvage Run</b><br>

The remains of the <i>Beagle II</i> were left on Pallas, since the <i>Orion</i>

could only load a minimum of personal belongings. Now the owner of a

mining company wants to salvage the wreck and see if there are any

interesting mineral samples aboard. It's all legal, nothing to worry

about - until the adventurers discover that they aren't alone on

Pallas. What's living there is up to you, but recommended sources are

Robinson Crusoe, Alien, and/or Psycho...</td></tr></table>



<p>In 1915 the physicist and mathematician Einstein announced his General

Theory of Relativity, and within a matter of months the Grand Unified

Theory linking all aspects of force, matter, and energy. Building on

the work of Rennick, Planck, Bohr, Crookes, and others, it was an

intellectual triumph and the key to rapid advances in every field of

science, which were accompanied by improvements in the speed, range,

and endurance of spacecraft.



<p>By 1916 the situation seemed more stable; a sizeable proportion of the

most productive land on Earth was now underwater, but the waters

seemed to have stopped rising, and winters were becoming colder again.

Despite this, meteorologists estimated that it would be decades before

the seas returned to more normal levels. Unfortunately this left most

of the European nations with insufficient space for their populations,

now crowded inland to escape the floods. The results were inevitable.



<p><b>Tensions Mounting In Europe<br>

Archduke Ferdinand Assassinated<br>

WAR!</b><br>

(Newspaper Headlines 1916)



<p>1916-17 saw the Great War, the first and (so far) only major war of

the Space Age. For decades tensions between Britain and the European

powers had been growing; the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand

during a state visit to Vienna catalysed events, and sent the nations

of Europe on a headlong dash to war.



<p>Even now some of the reasons for the war are unclear, but it seems

apparent that all sides were desperate for land and their neighbours'

resources, and believed that they could somehow avoid the full horrors

of modern conflict. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand (a success

after many earlier failures) was the excuse they needed. British hopes

rested on the surface fleet and the <i>Nova</i>-class spaceships, Germany had

three flying dreadnoughts and a sizeable submarine fleet, and France

had invested substantial sums in armed flyers. Further afield, America

appeared to be determinedly neutral, and Russia and Japan were

preparing to conquer the colonies of the combatant powers as soon as

the war was well under way.



<p>Within a week the German invasion of Belgium bogged down, slowed to a

crawl by marshy conditions and a new form of warfare; the Belgians had

secretly developed a large fleet of amphibious land ironclads, the

so-called tortoises, equally at home on land or in water, which were

almost invulnerable to bombs and cannon fire and stopped the German

ground forces in their tracks. The German dreadnoughts dropped troops

in Brussels and Liege, only to find the cities virtually deserted and

heavily mined; the population had been evacuated into France, and the

tough Belgian army was reinforced by a large contingent of Dutch

refugees. Meanwhile Britain found that the German dreadnoughts were

tougher than expected, while the Germans were horrified to discover

that the <i>Nova</i> and her sister-ships were fully equipped for underwater

operation, and could outrun any German ship and vanish into the sea if

they ran into serious problems. After HMS <i>Nova</i> and units of the

surface fleet destroyed the flying dreadnought <i>Bremen</i>, the Germans

became reluctant to bring their big ships close to the coast, and this

severely hampered their operations. The French flyers also had a

substantial effect; although their light armaments couldn't hope to

harm German dreadnoughts, they were a continual menace to the German

troops, who found themselves harried on the ground and in the air.



<p>At sea things were much more even; the British and German surface

navies were of roughly comparable strength, and casualties were heavy

on both sides. The British ships were fully equipped to deal with

aerial attack, and the sheer size of the German flying dreadnoughts

made them easy targets, but insufficient attention had been paid to

anti-submarine tactics. Meanwhile the German surface fleet was

woefully unprepared for British aerial hit-and-run tactics, but fully

prepared to meet conventional units. Eight ships were destroyed in the

first week of the war, and the death toll continued to rise until it

ended.



<p>In space commerce raiders began to attack German freighters and mining

ships, while the Germans destroyed British and French bases on the

Moon. Fortunately these operations were conducted with remarkably few

casualties, and with a chivalry singularly lacking on Earth; typically

the attacking craft ensured that any survivors had ample oxygen, and

radioed their position before vanishing into space.



<p>After several months the war was getting nowhere; Belgium was

devastated, many ships had been sunk, but none of the contending

powers had anything worthwhile to show for their efforts. At this

point America, still officially neutral, unleashed an unprecedented

form of warfare.



<p>During December 1916 silver prices rose steadily, partly because of

war pressures, but mostly because American buyers were making massive

purchases in Europe. The warring powers were delighted to take

American gold, since values were fully recovered from the Mercurian

scare of 1910-12, and vast quantities of metal changed hands.



<p>At the end of January 1917 President Wilson announced that, because of

the economic effects of the war, America would adopt the silver

standard at the beginning of March. The warring countries paid little

attention, wrongly assuming that the silver purchases had been made by

profiteers who had learned of the impending change. On March 1st

America switched to silver, and began to dump gold on the

international currency market, systematically wrecking the economies

of the warring nations. In a week the amount of gold in circulation

had quadrupled, and its price was plummeting; silver prices were

sky-high, of course, but it gradually became clear that a vast

proportion of the metal was already in American hands. Those nations

which adhered to a strict gold standard found that there was no money

for foreign purchases; countries following the practice of bimetallism

(the use of both currency metals) were in a less precarious state, but

still forced to dance to the American tune. Soon it was obvious that

the Americans had an effectively limitless gold supply, and that the

metal was now worth less than lead. Since there was no sign of any

unusual activity on Mercury or the Moon, apart from the events of the

war, the Americans must have found an enormous deposit of the pure

metal somewhere in the Asteroid belt. This conclusion was confirmed

after the war, when US Steel published the first pictures of Asteroid

1916-K7, now better known as the "six million ton ingot".



<p>Gradually the economies of the warring nations faltered and stagnated.

All were dependent on foreign suppliers for a variety of needs, from

food to armaments and industrial chemicals. Suddenly their currencies

were virtually worthless. By May the war was over; German forces

withdrew from Belgium, and the armed forces of Europe slowly reverted

to their peacetime status. Belgium threatened to sue Germany for

reparations, but Germany (like the rest of Europe) was almost

bankrupt.



<p>While the war was over, the problems it created took some time to end.

The most pressing was the issue of currency. Without excessive value,

gold could become what it should always have been; an extremely useful

industrial metal, conductive, corrosion-resistant, and attractive.

Something else was needed to take its place. Since it was apparent

that the Asteroids and the planets might contain any imaginable

mineral, it became imperative to find a new currency standard that was

not susceptible to a lucky discovery. Silver was a useful stop-gap,

but too much is already in American hands.



<p>Eventually the economist John Maynard Keynes produced an answer,

especially appealing to industrialised nations, which is slowly

becoming a global standard. In many ways R. gold is the perfect

currency metal; durable and attractive, its value is almost entirely a

product of the work and energy needed to make it, and thus reasonably

stable; it will only fall if there are new discoveries which reduce

the cost, and such discoveries are likely to lead to economic

improvements which will more than offset the reduced value of

currency. Storage difficulties mean that it is most useful as the

backing for paper currency, but coins have already been minted and are

in limited circulation. Of course there are snags; tills must have a

special compartment to hold these coins, and they can float out of

pockets if they aren't properly secured. Banks must check their value

by comparing their negative weight and inertial mass. Forgery is

possible, but a forger still needs to make quantities of R. gold, and

purchasing the necessary equipment and power enriches the economy

indirectly.





<p><b>Smeaton Works "Ready For New Challenge"<br>

Allcock And Brown Launch <i>"Stella"</i> Fund<br>

To The Stars!</b><br>

(Newspaper Headlines 1919-1920)



<p>By 1918 it was possible to seriously consider travel beyond the solar

system, and in 1919 the explorers Alcock and Brown began to solicit

funds for an expedition to Alpha Centauri. The response was

overwhelmingly favourable, and construction of the <i>Stella</i> began only

four months later.



<p>Meanwhile a 75-inch telescope was erected on Mount Edward, on the far

side of the Moon; while a little smaller than the instrument on Mount

Wilson in America, the lunar instrument is free of all atmospheric

haze, and thus capable of unprecedented magnification. It also

incorporates Ganymedan technology, such as a spectrometer with

unusually high sensitivity. Once operational, scientists detected

planets in three nearby solar systems, and began to understand the

true extent of the galaxy. Few readers will have forgotten the furore

that followed the discovery of oxygen in the spectra of the fourth and

fifth planets of Proxima Centauri, and the decision to change the goal

of the <i>Stella</i> expedition.



<p>Today we hope that a new era of peace is beginning. There is a

widespread realisation that war is now insanely dangerous. At least a

dozen nations have their own spacecraft, and any ship is potentially a

meteor of devastating size and speed, capable of exceeding the damage

suffered by Moscow in 1908. There have been widespread and apparently

irreversible population movements, impelled by the rising seas.

Borders are becoming a joke, posing no barrier to any flyer. The

Ganymedans have set us an example of the advantages of peace, and the

Venusians have reminded us that is possible to base a society on love,

while the Martians are a grim warning of the perils of war, and a

potential threat to the rest of the solar system. In response to these

circumstances the League Of Nations was founded in 1918, and has

already been joined by most industrialised countries. It is not

intended that it should become a global government; it will be a forum

for peaceful co-operation and arbitration between sovereign member

nations. War will hopefully become a thing of the past, as the

countries of the world extend their dominions into space.



<p>As war becomes obsolete, many other social issues are gaining

prominence. For example, the question of womens suffrage still vexes

Parliament, while Ireland remains the hot potato of British politics.

Abroad, growing socialist movements and anarchist agitators threaten

the stability of Germany and Russia, although their monarchs still

retain firm control. While borders become less relevant, the freedom

provided by flyers has not been an unmixed blessing; fugitives, spies,

and other undesirables are also able to cross borders at will, and the

church believes that flight has led to a general decline in moral

standards, as the owners of fast flyers use them for loose living. To

paraphrase a recent wireless talk by the Bishop of Westminster, in the

last century we made much of our entertainment in our own homes;

today, flyer owners think nothing of travelling twenty or fifty miles

for a party, and the natural consequence has been a decline in family

values. Who can tell where this will lead?



<p>Despite these potential problems, most experts see the future as

bright, and are optimistic about our continued development of the

worlds of the solar system. And in the future, perhaps, the worlds of

our neighbouring stars.



<p>As this last article was about to go to press Alcock and Brown reached

Lilla-Zaidie, radioing news of conditions there and the message that

they intend to carry on to Proxima Centauri as planned. We wish these

gallant explorers every success in this great endeavour; if all goes

well they will return in 1930, and humanity will then have taken its

first steps in the next great stage of exploration.

<a name=wb22><h2>2.2  Britain in 1901</h2><a href=#contents>return to contents</a>

<p>Queen Victoria is dead, and the staid pace of the Victorian era seems

to be coming to an end. Motor cars are becoming an everyday sight,

Count Zeppelin's gigantic airship has just flown over Germany, and,

most miraculous of all, Britons have visited the Moon and our

neighbouring planets.



<p>At a time when most London homes still have gas lighting and outdoor

plumbing, it's hard to believe that mankind can fly; the news that

it's possible to fly through space is only a little more remarkable.

Even so, it's just one event amongst many; most Britons are more

interested in the disastrously slow progress of the South African War

(the Boer War), following the campaign via newspaper reports and maps.



<p>While Britain presents a facade of military might and strong social

structures, the cracks are starting to show. The war has revealed

serious deficiencies in the army's tactics and strategy; predicted to

last a few weeks, it will drag on until May 1902. The war highlights

one statistic that starkly exposes the ills of modern industrial

society; even after the army lowered its standards for recruits, only

10% of the 12,000 men who volunteered in Manchester were medically

fit. The rest suffered from a variety of illnesses related to

pollution, overwork, and malnutrition. The other big industrial cities

are little better. In just ten years the population has risen by 3.8

million; meanwhile Ireland's population has shrunk from 6.5 to 4.3

million, largely a result of emigration to America. The government is

slowly moving towards granting home rule to Ireland, but the

Protestant minority in the province opposes any change. This minority

includes many influential land owners and most of the Irish peers and

members of Parliament, and the end result will be a series of

unsatisfactory compromises leading to bloodshed.



<p>While Britannia still claims to rule the waves, much of the fleet is

poorly equipped, slow, and obsolete. The flight of the <i>Astronef</i> makes

the situation worse; the continental powers are rumoured to be

developing flying warships, and Britain doesn't seem to be doing much

to counter them. Meanwhile the grinding poverty of much of the

population has resulted in the rise of the Labour movement, distrust

of the government and capitalists, strikes, and crime. At the moment

the government is the right-wing Conservative party, led by Lord

Salisbury, with a majority of 128 seats. Almost all of the opposition

is Liberal, but the growing unrest of the workers has led to the slow

rise of the Labour party. In 1901-6 six Labour MPs will be elected in

by-elections, with 29 Labour and 34 "Lib-Lab" MPs taking seats after

the 1906 General Election. At first the Labour party will simply

represent the rights of the working man, later becoming the voice of

socialism in Britain.



<p>A crucial key to the future is the new King, Edward VII. When Victoria

reigned, the Prince of Wales was widely regarded as a "lightweight"

figure, often involved in scandals and far too frivolous to rule. His

first public acts as King have done much to heal this distrust, and

most Britons are now prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. By

the Coronation, in 1902, he will be widely loved and respected; he

will spend a portion of his time in the public eye, and will soon be

seen by more of his subjects, especially those of the lower classes,

than ever saw the reclusive Victoria. During his reign he will do much

to encourage the modernisation of the armed forces and improvements in

social and economic conditions.



<p>Despite the new democratising influences, social class is still

overwhelmingly important in Britain. There are dozens of gradations

between the lowest and highest ranks, often so subtle that they are

only apparent to an insider. At the bottom are the unemployed, the

dross of the working classes. Their only recourse is to beg or seek

the "charity" of the workhouse, where revolting food and poor

accommodation must be paid for with hours of back-breaking toil. Next

come the poorest industrial and agricultural workers, often living six

or eight to a room, poorly fed and clothed. Above these are foremen

and other manual workers whose posts involve some degree of

responsibility. All are made to feel inferior to the poorest clerk.

Meanwhile servants have their own hierarchy, as do the self-employed,

the employers, and the aristocracy. At the top, the fate of Britain

and the Empire is mainly determined by a tiny minority; the most

important landed aristocrats, a few key figures in the armed forces,

and some leading industrialists. The King knows them all, and spends

much of his time at their homes or in their company. He moves with an

entourage of at least eighteen servants and detectives, more if he is

accompanied by the Queen, and anyone who wishes to take an active role

in society must be prepared to accommodate all of them, along with

dozens of other guests and a small army of servants, whenever the King

makes it known that he might consider accepting an invitation.



<p>The rigid stratification of society is felt in many subtle ways; one

of the oddest aspects is the question of headgear. Regardless of

class, no man in Britain will willingly be seen outdoors without a

hat. Its type and quality reflect social status, occasion, and wealth.

You raise your hat to show deference to those you meet; without a hat

you defer to everyone, regardless of status. Hats are chosen in

accordance with the season and the occasion. For example, a gentleman

will own two or three top hats of the latest style; the name of his

hatter is an instant guide to his position, and even without a label

can often be determined by such qualities as the curve of the brim or

the finish of the lining (see Murder Must Advertise by Dorothy L.

Sayers for a later example). The colour of the hat and its band are

even more significant indicators; a subtle mismatch between the

occasion and the hat are enough to brand the wearer as nouveau riche

or old-fashioned. Naturally there are special hats for special

occasions; straw boaters for punting, deer-stalkers for an expedition

to the moors, and so forth. Even schoolboys conform to this code. At

the poorest end of the spectrum every tramp or chimney sweep owns some

sort of hat or cap, even if it has been stolen from a scarecrow, and

often guys his betters by wearing a cast-off that is wholly

inappropriate to his status. Between these extremes there is little

variety; workmen and labourers always wear cloth caps, clerks always

wear bowler hats, and anyone who ventures to choose something

different will soon hear about it from colleagues and employers.



<p>For the wealthier classes elaborate meals are the norm, often running

to ten or twelve courses (although six or so are more usual). For the

poor, starvation wages and malnutrition are more common.



<p>While these social contrasts provide one easy way to think of the

period, there are many other possibilities. Even without the <i>Astronef</i>,

it would be the last great age of adventure; within a few years most

of the world will be mapped. Technology is changing by the day, with

endless wonders like electric light, X-rays, radium, and the R. force.

While most private transport is still horse-drawn, the world is

criss-crossed by elaborate rail systems; they are steam-powered, but

in the cities public transport is rapidly switching to electric trains

and trams, and omnibuses with internal combustion engines. It's the

decade of Sherlock Holmes' last cases and Fu Manchu's first crimes, of

Marie Curie and Mary Stopes, of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It

sees an immense flowering of science, education and literature, and of

spiritualism and dozens of crackpot crazes and religions. Anything

that you can imagine is probably happening somewhere - all that you

need do is look for it.

<a name=wb50><h2>5.0  The "Zaidie" Hypothesis</h2><a href=#contents>back to contents</a><p>


<p>This section consists of some EXTREMELY optional ideas for referees of

role playing games. If you are going to play a character in these

games, you REALLY don't want to read it, because your enjoyment may be

severely impaired. If you aren't interested in role playing games

there is no reason to read it at all.



<p>The ideas discussed below won't appeal to all referees, and have not

been used in the design of any of the adventures that accompany this

worldbook.



<a name=wb51><h2>5.1  The Observer Effect</h2><a href=#contents>return to contents</a>



<p><i>"...I've always thought that, as the air and water disappeared from

the upper parts of the Moon, the inhabitants, whoever they were,

must have been driven down into the deeper parts. Shall we go

down and see?..."</i>

<br><a href="moon.htm">A Visit To The Moon</a>



<p><i>"...they may not be men at all, but just a sort of monster with a

semi-human intellect, perhaps a superhuman one with ideas that we have

no notion of..."</i>

<br><a href="mars.htm">The World Of The War God</a>



<p><i>"...I shouldn't be surprised if we found the people of the Love-World

living on nectar and ambrosia..."</i>

<br><a href="venus.htm">A Glimpse Of The Sinless Star</a>



<p><i>"...Zaidie, we shall find human beings down there..."</i>

<br><a href="jupiter.htm">The World Of The Crystal Cities</a>



<p>While reading the <i>Astronef</i> stories you may notice something odd; more

often than not, Lord Redgrave or Zaidie makes a guess about the nature

of a world that is precisely right. It's possible, of course, that

their biographer later put words into their mouths; an unsympathetic

reader might even suggest that the stories are entirely fictional.

Naturally this is nonsense.



<p>If we assume that the stories are accurate, it's evident that both

characters have some foreknowledge of events to come. One possibility

is that both are capable of feats of precognition or intuition; a more

interesting idea is that their preconceived ideas are somehow altering

the course of events, and the universe itself. Would Mars have had

inhabitants if astronomers hadn't examined it through their telescopes

and decided that they saw canals? Would there be a gravity-free zone

between Saturn and its rings if Lord Redgrave and his wife hadn't

expected to find it? Was there life beneath the clouds of Venus in

1899?



<p>The "Zaidie Hypothesis" is an extreme form of solipsism; the

assumption that the nature of the universe is largely created by human

perceptions. We find what we expect to find, because we are

unconsciously shaping the universe to conform to our ideas. The Moon,

Venus, Mars, and Ganymede have humanoid natives because we expect

intelligent creatures to look like humans. Jupiter is a world of fire,

and Saturn's atmosphere is attracted outwards by its rings, because

dozens of astronomers and thousands of their readers shared this idea,

and because it was believed by Lord and Lady Redgrave.



<p>In the <i>Astronef</i> stories both of the Redgraves seem to have a hand in

this process, but Zaidie is a little more accurate. Murgatroyd rarely

participates and is usually wrong, perhaps because he is extremely

unimaginative.



<p>For example, consider the <i>Astronef</i>'s visit to Mars. Many thousands of

people had read Lowell's work, and all of them believed that Mars had

canals and seas. When the <i>Astronef</i> went there, it found exactly what

was expected. Nothing was known about the civilisation that built

them, but Lord Redgrave's peculiar ideas somehow turned out to be

exactly right.



<p>The implications are bizarre. Amongst other possibilities, it suggests

that a sufficiently ignorant group of observers may be able to shape

the universe to conform to their preconceptions. For instance, if

everyone aboard the first ship to Uranus had been convinced that it

was a world like Jupiter, they might have arrived to find a world in

flames. Similarly, adventurers who look for trouble on a new world

will always find it!



<p>Naturally the game universe shouldn't change form whenever a player or

character has a new idea. It should be impossible to change

"consensus" ideas held by a large number of people, or impose ideas

that are contrary to known facts and everyday experience. Crackpot

theories will have some effect, but only if the adventurers have heard

of them. The more that the adventurers know, the harder it should be

to make changes.



<a name=wb52><h2>5.2  Practical Mechanics</h2><a href=#contents>return to contents</a>



<p>Whether you use this idea or not, it is always a good idea to get your

players to explain their intentions, and intentions often reveal a lot

about ideas. For instance, adventurers who take great care to go armed

are expecting to find trouble. Adventurers who fill their pockets with

jelly babies may think that they'll be making new friends, or may just

be greedy!



<p>In this scheme the will of the adventurers, expressed as the average

of MIND and SOUL, is used to determine what they'll find. A minor

alteration of previously unknown reality should be easy, a complex

change should be difficult, but changing anything that all the

characters know should be impossible. The referee should note this

average for every character, and for the group as a whole.



<p>For instance, characters might be the crew of a freighter, thrown

off-course by a meteor and making an emergency landing on a convenient

(and hitherto undiscovered) asteroid. Average MIND and SOUL for the

team as a whole is 4. The referee has provisionally decided that the

asteroid has a thin but breathable atmosphere; if the characters say

nothing to the contrary, this world will be inhabited by peculiar but

friendly furry creatures who live in an underground cave complex,

drink nothing but soup, communicate by whistling, and will be

extremely helpful if the adventurers give them a can of chilli powder

and teach them some new recipes.



<p>As soon as the freighter lands, all the characters raid the armoury

for revolvers and other weapons. The referee decides that they aren't

expecting to encounter friendly natives. Changing the native

personality is easy; hitherto humans knew nothing about them, so the

Difficulty is only 2. Suddenly the natives have spears, knives, and

some primitive firearms; since they are hostile, they stay out of

sight until they are ready to attack.



<p>A little later the adventurers find the entrance to a cave. Ignoring

the asteroid's low gravity, but noticing that the entrance is covered

by a moderately thick stone slab, they decide that the creatures

living underneath must be very strong. Someone uses the fatal words

"on an asteroid like this, with low gravity, they must be bloody

huge". This isn't such an easy change, not least because the players

already know that the entrance is only two feet wide. The referee

expects that the other characters will disagree, but no-one seems to

notice the discrepancy. The player concerned averages MIND and SOUL 3.

The referee makes this Difficulty 10 and rolls the dice; on a 2 the

will of one adventurer changes reality again. Suddenly the asteroid is

inhabited by very large (but slim) furry natives.



<p>Several dice rolls later the hostile and extremely carnivorous natives

have captured one of the adventurers and are preparing to push him

into the soup pot. His screams are almost drowned by their deep

whistling roars. At this point the nature of these creatures is

permanently set; the adventurers know that they are facing huge

hostile carnivores, and the stage is set for a last-minute rescue or a

tragic death. It's too late to make more changes.





<a name=wb53><h2>5.3  Objections</h2><a href=#contents>return to contents</a>



<p>Referees usually prefer to design plots for themselves, and are

naturally reluctant to let the dice or the players dictate major

changes. It's also difficult to come up with new plot developments on

the fly. Used incautiously, a solipsistic universe can end up out of

control. The secret is to make the minimum changes necessary, and to

keep the number of decisions small.



<p>For instance, in our example in section 5.2 the inoffensive little

furry aliens initially became hostile little furry aliens, not

ravenous bugblattter beasts. They stayed small and cute until the

players decided otherwise. If the referee was determined to keep them

small he could have let the players see them before they reached a

decision. If he wanted to keep them friendly he could have assumed

that they had previously encountered another expedition, whose ideas

had "fixed" their nature. Since the characters knew nothing about

their civilisation it's obvious that word never got back to Earth, but

that could simply mean that the previous visitors are dead, or still

on their way home.



<p>A more serious objection is the idea that a solipsistic universe will

tend to be "user-friendly", a juvenile wish-fulfilment fantasy where

players' wildest dreams come true, populated largely by beautiful

maidens dressed mainly in jewels. This is especially likely if players

know or suspect that their ideas are being used to determine the

course of an adventure, or the nature of the game universe itself.

Phrases to watch out for include "I have a good feeling about this",

"There'll be lots of treasure here", and "These guys are peaceful, I'm

sure of it." This is the point at which a wise referee abandons the

Zaidie Hypothesis and returns to a more normal style of play. You may

also want to consider using your players' assumptions to lull them

into a false sense of security before hitting them with some

unexpected problems. For instance:

<pre>
 Player: "Right, we've convinced these aliens that we're gods from the
          stars. See, I said that they look gullible. Now I'm going to
          take the gem from that idol's forehead. I think that they'll
          give us all their treasure if we persuade them that our
          magic is better than theirs. I'm sure of it."

Referee: "Oh..kay.. [Rolls dice, pretends to look annoyed] The
          beautiful native maidens shower you with flower petals as
          you step forward. As you touch the gem the idol blinks.
          Stone eyelids flicker across the gem, amputating your
          fingernails, and its other eyes open, bathing you in baleful
          green light. It yawns, revealing sharklike teeth, and
          reaches out for you with all six arms."

 Player: "Oops..."
</pre>



<p>Played wisely, the Zaidie Hypothesis can be a good source of ideas and

plot development. With more mature players it can even be the focus of

a campaign; how did this ability arise, and why has the human race

been chosen to use it? Is the universe real, or just a construct of

consensus ideas, and is it possible to look beyond them to some

ultimate truth? Is there a God, and why has she, he, or it given us

this strange ability? Are we all figments of the imagination,

characters in some vast unimaginable game? When you know the truth,

grasshopper, it will be time for you to leave.



<p>On which philosophical point the author bows out, leaving referees to

decide whether or not to use this idea...

would rival many governments, and can be a formidable enemy.

<br>Equipment as above.

<br>Notes: This is an alternative for referees with a more cynical slant

on life. Redgrave is a cunning schemer, possibly a borderline

psychopath. He encouraged Professor Rennick to work himself into an

early grave, possibly helping things along by employing an incompetent

doctor, then married Zaidie to ensure that he owned all rights to her

father's inventions. Evidence in favour of this theory includes his

behaviour on Mars (taunting the Martians into an attack, then

retaliating with much more force than the situation warranted), and

his unprovoked taunting of, and attacks on, Saturnian sea-serpents. 

Zaidie is no threat, provided she continues to love him; if he were

ever to discover that she suspects the truth, or she were to seek a

divorce, it is likely that an unfortunate accident would quickly

follow.



<p>Note: Lord Redgrave's full name and titles are 'Rollo Lenox Smeaton

Aubrey, Earl of Redgrave, Baron Smeaton in the peerage of England, and

Viscount Aubrey in the Peerage of Ireland.'

will have at least one child. Her diaries and photographs, edited by

Mr. George Griffith, are perennial best sellers.



<p>Note: A Honeymoon In Space describes Zaidie as follows:

<br><i>'It was a face which possessed at once the fair Anglo-Saxon skin, the

firm and yet delicate Anglo-Saxon features, and the wavy wealth of the

old Saxon golden-brown hair; but a pair of big, soft, pansy eyes,

fringed with long curling, black lashes, looked out from under dark

and perhaps a trifle heavy eyebrows. Moreover, there was that

indescribable expression in the curve of her lips and the pose of her

head; to say nothing of a lissom, vivacious grace in her whole

carriage which proclaimed her a daughter of the younger branch of the

Race That Rules.'</i>

<a name=wbA><h2>APPENDIX A - George Griffith</h2><a href=#contents>back to contents</a><p>

<p>George Chetwynd Griffith-Jones (1857-1906) was one of the most

prolific and influential SF authors of his day, but he was always

overshadowed by Wells. His work often appeared in British

magazines, most notably Pearson's Weekly and Pearson's Magazine, and

he helped to create a genre of sensationalised "high-tech" future war

stories, typified by the work of Griffith himself, William le Queux,

and M.P. Shiel, in which new inventions totally revolutionised

warfare. His strong revolutionary politics made him unpopular with

American publishers, and little of his work appeared there. He was a

globe-trotter and explorer, whose exploits included a voyage around

the world in 65 days (shattering all previous records), and discovery

of the source of the Amazon.



<p>Griffith's work often mixed Utopian themes with quasi-religious

apocalyptic disaster. For instance, The Angel Of The Revolution (1893)

and its sequel Olga Romanoff (1893-4) describe a benevolent revolution

(involving flying battleships) which leads to a world government, a

second revolution which leaves the world in a state of anarchy,

climaxed by a cosmic disaster caused by the impact of a comet which

leads to an Utopia. In the <i>Astronef</i> stories we see two worlds

collide to form a new sun, incidentally saving the characters and

strengthening their religious beliefs.



<p>While it must be admitted that Griffith was never as good an author as

Wells, Doyle, or Kipling, his stories showed endless energy and a

steady stream of interesting ideas which were occasionally more

accurate than those of his rivals.

<a name=wbB><h2>APPENDIX B - The <i>Astronef</i> Stories and Science Fiction</h2><a href=#contents>back to contents</a><p>



<p>Readers familiar with pulp science fiction will notice some striking

parallels between the <i>Astronef</i> stories and common themes in early

space opera. These parallels are most notable in the second story,

"The World Of The War God".



<p>The standard form of this story is a wish fulfilment fantasy. A

scientific genius (invariably male) invents a means of space travel.

Often accompanied by a wife or fiancee, or by a group of loyal

friends, our hero lands on another planet, only to discover that he

has inadvertently stumbled into a war. Usually he takes sides, often

ramming some or all the ships of an alien fleet. Sometimes this is a

mistake. Eventually he saves the nicer of the two sides, in a way that

guarantees that the grateful natives will grant humans incredible

honours or even ask them to rule their planet. Often one or more of

the characters marries a native princess.



<p>While this is rather more elaborate (and a good deal less believable)

than the plot of The World Of The War God, the similarities are

obvious. This theme was used by E.E. 'Doc' Smith (in "The Skylark of

Space" and sequels, in the "Lensman" novels, and in his "Spacehounds

of IPC"), by John W. Campbell (The "Black Star Passes" and sequels),

and elsewhere. These stories also often include worlds civilisations

with a philosophical or scientific bent resembling the Ganymedans of

"The World Of The Crystal Cities". The most obnoxious aliens are often

modelled on racist lines, and there is a strong vein of xenophobia

running though all these stories; "Humans Uber Alles", with "humans"

defined as White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, was the spirit behind much

early SF.



<p>The technical name for this type of story is an <i>Edisonade</i>, because

characters are usually modelled on the American inventor; in some

Edison appears as a character. I have no information on his reaction

to this attention.



<p>While it would be nice to believe that Griffith inspired most early

science fiction, or invented the Edisonade, the sad fact is that he

didn't; Garrett P. Servis's "Edison's Conquest Of Mars" appeared in

America (as a reply to Wells) in 1898, and it and the near-endless Tom

Swift series (1910 onwards) are mainly responsible for this vocabulary

of ideas in early American science fiction. Griffith explored these

ideas independently; in many ways he's more believable and readable

than other authors of the period, but regrettably his work seems to

have had no long-term effect on the genre.



<a name=wbC><h2>APPENDIX C - Recommended Reading</h2><a href=#contents>back to contents</a><p>



<p><h4>Reference:</h4>

<p><b>Clute & Nicholls: The Encyclopaedia Of Science Fiction [1993]</b>

<br>No apologies for recommending this book again. It's essential reading

on George Griffith, Edisonades, and other themes.



<p><b>Dr Harold Priestly: The What It Cost The Day Before Yesterday Book [1979]</b>

<br>A source for many of the prices.



<p><b>Patrick Moore: Concise Atlas Of The Universe [1974], The Guinness Book

Of Astronomical Facts And Feats [1979]</b>

<br>These books, and the computer programs credited in the introduction,

were my main sources of astronomical data, which has been sadly abused

in this worldbook. The Guinness book is especially useful as a source

for the dates of various discoveries.





<p><h4>Fiction:</h4>

<br>Several of the books mentioned in the rules are very relevant to these

stories. Additionally, any of the following are useful:



<p><b>Brian Aldiss & Harry Harrison: Farewell Fantastic Venus [1968]</b>

<br>An anthology of stories set on Venus, from 1897 to 1967. Includes an

extract from the novel Honeymoon In Space; my first encounter with the stories.



<p><b>Stephen Baxter: Anti-Ice [1993]</b>

<br>A modern "steampunk" version of an Edisonade.



<p><b>D.R. Bensen: And Having Writ.. [1978]</b>

<br>An alternate world where aliens, whose ship was the Tunguska asteroid

in our world, managed to crash-land instead. They try to manipulate

human society to speed our technical development. Naturally things

don't go as planned. Characters include Edison, Churchill, most of the

crowned heads of Europe, Mark Twain, H.G. Wells, Hitler (very briefly)

and many others.



<p><b>Daniel F. Galouye: The Infinite Man [1973]

<br>Robert A. Heinlein: They [1941]</b>

<br>Two interesting and extremely paranoid stories which discuss some of

the issues raised in section 5, above. For various reasons it is not

appropriate to detail their plots.



<p><b>Captain W.E. Johns: Kings of Space [1954, and sequels to 1963]</b>

<br>Written for juveniles, this series of novels is possibly the last to

seriously use the 19th century view of the solar system. The Moon

supports life, Venus is a primeval world of dinosaurs and cavemen,

Mars is a dying planet whose natives now live on the asteroids, and

Jupiter is a raging inferno. Combines flying saucers with

Velikovsky-style catastrophes, Martian canals, and references to

Atlantis and the Flood. Johns is also the author of the Biggles

stories, which can be an excellent source of ideas for an exploratory

campaign.



<p><b>H.G. Wells: The Star [1897]</b>

<br>A fast-moving star passes through the Solar System and nearly destroys

the Earth.
