<p>Funny thing about auras, though &#8212; they&#8217;re kind of hard to stick a pin into.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Percentage of Clinton Voters who said they would NOT support Barack Obama for President on June 8, 2008: 21%</strong></p>
<p><strong>Percentage who say they will NOT support Barack Obama for President TODAY: 28%</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>More <strong><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/09/clinton_backers_4.html">HERE.</a></strong> I guess the more we get to know him, the less we like him, huh? And we&#8217;re Democrats for goodness&#8217; sake. So 28% of us are definitely NOT voting for Obama. That&#8217;s what? Like 5 MILLION votes. Bush beat Kerry by <strong><a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0922901.html">3 million votes</a></strong> in 2004. In any case, in addition to the 5 million Democrats who are already decided against Obama, there are still another 14% of Clinton voters who &#8220;haven&#8217;t yet made up their minds.&#8221; That&#8217;s another 2 MILLION or so Democrats who aren&#8217;t saying who they&#8217;re voting for. Bill Clinton beat Bob Dole by about <strong><a href="http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1996/summ.htm">8 million votes</a></strong> in 1996, and it was considered a minor landslide. It may too early to say we told you so, but it&#8217;s not too early to start savoring the thought.</p>
<p>So, the Western State Strategy? You remember don&#8217;t you? Obama was going to competitively force McCain into fighting for his territory in the West and maybe even pick up some traditionally red states, like Montana, Wisconsin, New Mexico, and even Alaska? Yes, it was to be the triumphant culmination of Howard&#8217;s Brilliant 50-State <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Spending Spree</span>, I mean Strategy. <strong><a href="http://www.270towin.com/2008_polls/mccain_obama/">OOPS.</a></strong></p>

			<p>With less than 42 days to go, it&#8217;s going to be a sprint to Election Day.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t have to wait until November 4th to make your voice heard. With early voting beginning in Nebraska on Monday, September 29th &#8212; both in person and by mail &#8212; you can be one of the first to cast your ballot for Barack.</p>
<p>Early voting is fast, easy, and allows you to avoid Election Day lines. And it could make the difference in this election.</p>
<p>Show your support for Barack and Democrats up and down the ballot &#8212; make sure you are registered to vote and find your early vote location and hours.</p>

Biden garbles Depression history</p>
<p>Joe Biden&#8217;s denunciation of his own campaign&#8217;s ad to Katie Couric got so much attention last night that another odd note in the interview slipped by.</p>
<p>He was speaking about the role of the White House in a financial crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the stock market crashed, Franklin Roosevelt got on the television and didn&#8217;t just talk about the princes of greed,&#8221; Biden told Couric. &#8220;He said, &#8216;Look, here&#8217;s what happened.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>As Reason&#8217;s Jesse Walker footnotes it: &#8220;And if you owned an experimental TV set in 1929, you would have seen him. And you would have said to yourself, &#8216;Who is that guy? What happened to President Hoover?&#8217;&#8221;<br />

			<p>Yes, let&#8217;s start savoring, and it tastes goooood!! </p>
<p>On Sunday evening I got a call from Moveon.org. I left those guys as soon as I heard they were supporting BO after a brief informal question to their members, early in the year.  The guy had an earful from me after he asked for my help volunteering in an office here in FLA.<br />
He finished with: But you voted for Hillary, didn&#8217;t you? Yeah, I did.- Well, she&#8217;s supporting Obama!- he said. I answered: As much as I admire her, nor she or anybody else can tell me whom to vote for. Don&#8217;t call again, please.<br />
It felt so good.</p>

<p>It is always shocking to me to see the kind of mis-information that people are getting.  The Navel Acdemy is highly considered.  I do not know about when McCain went there, here is today:<br />
<a href="http://www.usna.edu/academics.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usna.edu/academics.htm</a></p>
<p>I suggest you ask your sister what rank Obama graduated with from the college(s) he did his undergraduate work at.  The only information they released from the schools was that he did not graduate with honors.  BO will not release his transcripts and his graduate thesis is mysteriously missing.</p>
<p>His great law school work was done after he met MO.</p>
<p>The O&#8217;bots love to compare BO&#8217;s Graduate Education to McCains undergraduate class rank.  Apples and Oranges.  BO was a drug abuser and probably just passed.</p>

			<p>HELP NEEDED (again)</p>
<p>Does anyone have info that verifies that the DNC Drafting Committee mtg summarily rejected the I Own My Vote platform outright? I have the C-Span link of the entire meeting (thanks to Texas Tigress), but before I launch into another thrilling day of watching Howard Dean and his cronies drone on and one trying to find the 12 second segment where they rejected the I Own My Vote Platform without even a discussion about it, though I&#8217;d try to cut to the chase and see if anyone has info about that Moment of Rejection!</p>

<p>Just now after reading the story about the Florida woman who was &#8220;supposed&#8221; to have told the reporter that she couldn&#8217;t imagine a black in the White House, I decided that if a reporter can not find a story that fits his agenda, he makes up a story that fits right in with his agenda.</p>

			<p>GBPuma-just went downstairs and saw your reply.  I think your question had to do with security clearances and background checks.</p>
<p>If you google &#8220;Where can I find form 86?&#8221; you will be able to get the security clearance form for applicants for positions within the federal government that require certain levels of security clearance (the depth of the investigation depends upon the security clearance level).</p>
<p>The form notes &#8220;agencies, military, etc.&#8221;  According to the official list of government agencies, &#8220;Executive Office of the President of the United States&#8221; is included in the list.</p>
<p>I believe these two areas were dealing with your question which had to do with background checks for someone running for President.  Someone had posted that the SAC for the FBI in Cleveland had said the FBI didn&#8217;t do background checks on elected officials.  As you can see if you review the security clearance form, there is a lot of information that has to be provided.  Also, the President of the United States would also fall into the category of needing the mandatory security check every five years (that is, if he/she was re-elected).  That information is on a different website than the form.</p>
<p>Not everyone is interested in this particular topic so if you would like more information about it let MamaPuma know and I can get more information to you via email.</p>

ARTICLE POSTING SUGGESTION<br />
Anyone who wants to post an entire article (not just the link) has to pay for ad time! Maybe $5 or $10. What do you think?<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
Anna, Amen!!<br />
I think $5, or more, for anything longer than one to two standard summary paragraphs of an article with link.<br />
and<br />
$5 charge for links or Youtubes that aren&#8217;t accompanied by a sentence describing what their content.</p>
<p>Think of all the time and space we could save, to say nothing of the vast amounts that would be contributed to Puma PAC.</p>

<p>    I suggest you ask your sister what rank Obama graduated with from the college(s) he did his undergraduate work at. The only information they released from the schools was that he did not graduate with honors. BO will not release his transcripts and his graduate thesis is mysteriously missing.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice Headclunk but the link was my giving advice to another PUMA.<br />

<p>&#8220;Not surprisingly, it was a non-starter from the DNC&#8217;s perspective. According to multiple sources, representatives for DNC Chairman Howard Dean ruled the proposed amendment out of order, since it spoke to a change in party rules, and referred it to the rules committee for a future discussion. Unlike other failed amendments, however, Amendment 93 was not even granted a debate at the platform meeting, a development which set some Clinton supporters on edge.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Some Radical Rules that perhaps we can apply to our future prowls.</p>
<p>#1 Ridicule is man&#8217;s most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage. </p>
<p>#2 Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. </p>
<p>#3 A good tactic is one that your people enjoy<br />
Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions, and utilize all events of the period for your purpose. </p>
<p>#4 The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.<br />
ie., When Brazile threatens that the blacks will riot if Obama does not win.  That is a threat&#8230;.</p>
<p>#5 If you push a negative hard and deep enough it will break through into its counter side; this is based on the principle that every positive has its negative. </p>
<p>etc. etcetera</p>

			<p>#21Anna and Mick: It is.  Another part of the new world order is the new President of the UN General Assembly;;<br />
Miguel D&#8217;Escoto Brockmann..and who is that? He is one of three silenced Catholic priests who practiced the art and craft of liberation theology in Nicaauragua, was a member of that government. Liberation Theology emanated within the Catholic Church and has been rejected by two Popes for its reduction of Scripture to the pracitce of Marxist ideologies.  Brockmann can no longer speak or act on behalf of the Church.  Is this a coincidence that he is elected while Obimbo, world citizen attempts to win the Presidency? I do not think so.</p>

			<p>OBAMA AUTHOR ANDY MARTIN INVITES INTERESTED &#8220;SHOE LEATHER&#8221; RESEARCHERS TO JOIN HIM IN HAWAII</p>
<p>MARTIN WILL LEAD A RESEARCH TEAM THAT WILL INVESTIGATE &#8220;THE LOST OBAMA&#8221; IN HAWAII</p>
<p>&#8220;WE ARE DOING THE JOB THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA REFUSE TO DO,&#8221; SAYS MARTIN</p>
<p>(NEW YORK)(September 23, 2008)  Andy Martin has an invitation for those who want to join in the effort to research and investigate the &#8220;Lost Obama.&#8221; &#8220;Join me in Hawaii.&#8221; Martin will lead a research team in Hawaii October 15-22.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a plethora of leads for Obama in Hawaii, and we have numerous stories with a Hawaii angle,&#8221; says Martin. &#8220;We have been forced to do the job the mainstream media refuse to do. The Internet rules!</p>
<p>&#8220;ContrarianCommentary.com is making available free participation in this research expedition. We are not collecting a penny from anyone. People who want to join us and share the research effort can make their own travel arrangements and hotel accommodations in Hawaii.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will link up on October 15th, and break up on the 22nd. We will have a full week to do in-depth investigation and reporting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is strange that the media have ignored Obama&#8217;s Hawaii years. How many stories have you seen on his formative period? Virtually none. Obama was not shaped by Chicago; he pitched up there as an adult. &#8216;Barry O&#8217; was shaped by his unconventional family in Hawaii. As a general election approaches, media usually write profusely on a candidate&#8217;s teenage years. There has been an iron curtain of silence imposed on Obama adolescence. All of us were teens once; we know how critical that development period is to our adult character. Truly, this is a period in Obama&#8217;s life that the media have tried to forget; they have created &#8216;the lost Obama.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will lead team volunteers as they help assemble a true picture of Obama in Hawaii. It is a unique opportunity to see news and analysis in the making. All people have to do is provide us with a paid reservation and we will allow them to join the team. We will assemble in Honolulu at our hotel. And from then on, the sky&#8217;s the limit as we conduct our field research on Barack Obama. We will assemble each morning and each evening to share ideas, results, suggestions, conclusions and the like,&#8221; says Martin.</p>
<p>Persons who are interested in joining ContrarianCommentary.com&#8217;s research team in Hawaii October 15-22 may contact Andy Martin.</p>
<p>P.S. We often call ourselves #1 in campaign commentary, analysis and investigation. Our cutting edge analysis of William Ayers and Barack Obama has received notice as the first attempt to create a systematic timeline of the relationship between the two men. </p>

He brought up the idea that Biden may say some crazy things on purpose to get bumped out.  He has said some Biden type comments ever since he said Hillary is a better canidate to be VP than he is.

<p>I work in Education and I&#8217;m sure it was the word &#8220;Terrorist&#8221; on that kid&#8217;s t-shirt and not Obama that was the issue. Schools are very, very hypersensitive to anything that even remotely suggests violence, since Columbine and lately, VA Tech.<br />
Also, each school has policies about what students can and cannot wear; it could be that any garment that has hand painted text on it might not be acceptable at this particular school&#8230;.</p>

I’ll have to think some more about this one… and brainstorm with my Latino puma friends.<br />
I actually have one (new) Mexican-American friend who lives in Incline Village, Nevada, who works in the CA Lake Tahoe area, near where I go sometimes. She’s undecided (about the election) but maybe can help in getting me/us connected in NV.</p>
<p>Anyway… I’ll post a couple of more things I prepared before (when everyone was sleeping).</p>

			<p>Now Biden Retracts Slam on Obama Ad </p>
<p>Tuesday, September 23, 2008 10:28 AM</p>
<p>By: Jim Meyers  Article Font Size   </p>
<p>Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden has backed away from a recent remark that called a political ad from his running mate Barack Obama’s campaign “terrible.” </p>
<p>The ad, launched this month, included unflattering footage of Republican presidential nominee John McCain at a hearing in the early 1980s, wearing giant glasses and an out-of-style suit, interspersed with shots of a disco ball, a clunky phone, an outdated computer and a Rubik&#8217;s Cube. </p>
<p>&#8220;He admits he still doesn&#8217;t know how to use a computer, can&#8217;t send an e-mail, still doesn&#8217;t understand the economy, and favors $200 billion in new tax cuts for corporations, but almost nothing for the middle class,&#8221; the ad said. </p>
<p>In an interview with CBS News on Monday, Biden said he disapproved of the ad, declaring: “I thought it was terrible.” He also said: “If I had anything to do with it, we’d have never done it.” </p>
<p>The McCain campaign immediately attacked Obama, invoking Biden&#8217;s words, The Washington Post reported. </p>
<p>&#8220;Barack Obama has brought the sleazy gutter politics of Chicago to our national stage, exposing his call for a &#8216;new politics&#8217; as a lie and embarrassing even his own running mate with the low road campaign he&#8217;s running,&#8221; said campaign spokesman Brian Rogers. </p>
<p>But in a statement the Obama campaign issued later, Biden says he had never seen the ad and only read press reports about it. </p>
<p>He also said: &#8220;Having now reviewed the ad, it is even more clear to me that given the disgraceful tenor of Senator McCain&#8217;s ads and their persistent falsehoods, his campaign is in no position to criticize.”</p>

<p>I wonder if Hannity is on to something. At the beginning of his radio show he spent about 15 minutes on the rumor Biden might get dumped for Hillary. He brought up the idea that Biden may say some crazy things on purpose to get bumped out. He has said some Biden type comments ever since he said Hillary is a better canidate to be VP than he is. Maybe he is doing it on purpose. It’s getting press coverage.<br />

			<p>Hi Puma&#8217;s</p>
<p>I attended a McCain/Palin rally yesterday in Media, Pa.<br />
It was a lot of fun. I meet some interesting people there. And Orange County choppers were there from the show and surprised McCain with a motorcycle. There were people there with shirts that said , &#8220;Bikers for McCain&#8221;. Also the Father from that show (don&#8217;t know his name) He mentioned McCain as being a vietnam war vet and mentioned his commitment to his country. It was a great closing to the event. Everyone&#8217;s saying they will be back here again as Pa. is a undecided state right now.</p>
<p>Also did my prowl for today &#8220;equal pay&#8221;.</p>

Dear Mr. King:</p>
<p>Why on earth would you have Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on your show?  What could possibly propel you to give air time to one of the worlds leading terrorists?  Do you not realize that by interviewing him you give him credibility?  Is there no journalistic, professional, humanistic line in the sand that you and those at CNN draw beyond which you will not cross?</p>
<p>I will not be watching your interview with this horrible man, nor will I be watching any other interviews you may conduct in the future. You, and CNN, have lost me as a viewer, permanently.</p>

GETTING <b>PHONE LISTS</b> for phoning to defeat BO</p>
<p>freddiebrown on 09.22.08 at 5:18 pm GETTING PHONE LISTS TO CALL :<br />
#107 TexasTigress on 09.22.08 at 4:36 pm:</p>
<p>Landi &#8211; what if we signed up to make phone calls for Obama and then when we get the phone list we call the people and tell them not to vote for him ???<br />
*********************************<br />
freddiebrown WROTE:</p>
<p>If anyone is interested, you can sign up (don’t use your info) and get a list of people that Obama wants you to call. This is from their Neighbor to Neighbor project.<br />
Once you get this list, you can either choose to NOT call (therefore tying up their list) or call and get them to not elect NoBama. I have signed up many times to get the list…</p>
<p>Use this link and go to the sign up. The list will appear on your screen right away so you can copy and paste to call or just ignore it.<br />
Sometimes you may not get any phone numbers &#8211; it depends on the zip code. You just have to try again. Once I didn’t get anything, it said no phone numbers available but I poked around and when I came back to the page, there were 25 phone numbers waiting for me.</p>

utahpuma on 09.22.08 at 5:26 pm WROTE:<br />
Landipuma, Ontherocks, TexasTigress……<br />
Heck, I’ll register to make calls and do whatever it takes to get as many lists as I can. I’ll make the calls but need to come up with what I’ll say. Maybe just mark them as calls made and get another list………………<br />
************************</p>
<p>Landi here: Would that give us local phone numbers or do they give us an option to get numbers for swing states?</p>

			<p><b>PROWLS WORK</b>  Sorry is is alittle long.  This concerns the university where the professor asked the students to tear apart Palin&#8217;s Speech:</p>
<p>Thank you for your concerns about the issues mentioned in recent news media stories. Metro State senior administration first learned of this situation via an article in the WorldNetDaily on Tuesday, Sept. 16. At that point, the College had not received any student complaints about the topic written about in the article.</p>
<p>Once Metro State became aware of this issue, administrators spoke with Affiliate Professor Andrew Hallam. Hallam agrees that while he was attempting to provide his students with a current and relevant writing assignment that would civically engage them, he should have expanded the assignment to allow the students to focus on more than one political figure.</p>
<p>The assignment was given on Thursday, Sept. 11. After further consideration over the weekend, Hallam decided to broaden the assignment and include other political candidates. A revised assignment was given at the next class session on Tuesday, Sept. 16, the same day as the WorldNetDaily article. </p>
<p>This morning, after being interviewed by several media outlets, one of Hallam&#8217;s students did file an official complaint, which the College is now investigating. If additional students in this classroom feel they have been bullied or harassed by students or a faculty member, we strongly encourage them to share their concerns with the College. English Chair Cindy Carlson attended Hallam&#8217;s class today and has publicly said her door is open to any concerned student or parent.</p>
<p>Metro State policies protect the freedom of both professors and students to discuss academic subjects fully, engage in research and publish the results of research, and write or speak as citizens without fear of institutional censorship or discipline. For professors, this protection is balanced by professional obligations, which include:<br />
·         Protecting the academic freedom of students<br />
·         Demonstrating respect for students as individuals<br />
·         Refraining from harassing or intimidating students.</p>
<p>If the College&#8217;s investigation concludes that a faculty member&#8217;s behavior is inconsistent with these rights and obligations, the College will intervene with such action as may be needed to correct the inappropriate behavior. To the extent permitted by law, the College will inform the public of this action. </p>
<p>Thank you again for your feedback.  If you have additional questions, feel free to contact me directly.</p>
<p>Catherine B. Lucas</p>
<p>Associate Vice President of Communications and Advancement Metropolitan State College of Denver</p>

<p>OMG, Biden sounded as if he were half in the bag.<br />
Televisions only became commercially available in the late 1930s, most Americans didn’t own one, and FDR didn’t give a fireside video chat on the stock market. As for the second excuse (which alleges he was a New York Governor so he may’ve addressed America), that still would’ve meant that there was no commercially available television in 1929. Even his spinners can’t get their stories (or which crash he was talking about) straight.<br />
 It would be kind of funny if it wasn’t so sad.</p>

<p>Obama dumps Biden<br />
DNC dumps Obama<br />
The real democrats from the United States of America bring the only candidate worth to be selected as the real Democratic nominee !!! The DNC decides to go back to the roots for which it was founded many years ago. But they are so corrupted that the last one is very unlikely to happen</p>

			<p>Obama May Not Return to D.C. for Bailout Vote</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/09/23/politics/fromtheroad/entry4472357.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/09/23/politics/fromtheroad/entry4472357.shtml</a></p>
<p>Although Barack Obama argues that the financial meltdown is an “emergency situation”, he said today that he may remain on the campaign trail, rather than returning to the Capitol, to vote on the $700 billion plan. </p>
<p>“Look if we get a consensus and everybody is popping champagne – then I will probably be going back to campaign with folks who are having a tough time in places like Ohio, and Michigan and Pennsylvania,” Obama said adding, “If this ends up being a close vote or a vote where the outcome is an open question then obviously this is a top priority.” </p>
<p>popping champagne???? someone please put me out of my misery.</p>

<p>Maybe we should add the question, “Is the only reason you are giving this terrorist a voice because he’s a friend of Obama’s” Even 5th graders are aware that Obama has terrorists friends — how come CNN fails to report this?</p>

<p>That won&#8217;t cause McCain to take the fall. There was a poll that only 26% of the population was for the Bail out Bill&#8230; I also highly recommend you watch this interview on the links below between Gingrich and Greta. Gingrich suggests that if Obama is for the bill and McCain is not &#8212; that this would actually prove that Obama is on the side of Bush while McCain is on the side of the people. Watch the videos.</p>

I have a dear good friend who lives in Scranton who voted for Hillary (but was on the fence for a while during the primaries before I convinced her to go for Hillary!) <img src='http://blog.pumapac.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=':wink:' class='wp-smiley' />  </p>
<p>After Hillary got out of the picture, my friend moved over to BO.<br />
I’ve been working on her ever since and we’ve been having intense email exchanges. Anyway, this may be off the wall, but just wondering if you live near her and about the possibility that you may help lead her to something that might help ‘convert’ her… like an event around there or something (someone like Carly Fiorina might convince her, for example).</p>

			<p>Bobram has worked hard to create TV contact info for us, and NVPuma researched and created a TV, Print, and Radio contact list ofr Nevada, mostly Northern Nevada.<br />
Anna7000 added a talking points list. All are located in the Media section of the Puma PAC Action Center.</p>
<p>Bobram isnt sure he wants to invest that many more hours do the research required to make lists of print media for us.</p>
<p>These resources are useless unless we use them.<br />
Please write to the contacts listed. Let them know why you aren&#8217;t voting for Obama. Ask them to cover oabama related issues.. list a few. Use Anna&#8217;s suggested talking points if you you don&#8217;t have any of your own.</p>
<p>We have precious time remaining before the election.</p>
<p>I  know many of you are taking action on your own, and not waiting for formal or informal prowls. For those of you who aren&#8217;t self motivated&#8230; try imagining obama as the president for the next 8 years, then please check the critical states list and send email, send one email every hour. It takes only a few minutes. Also, some of the stations have links to comment areas. Take advantage of these and leave comments. The Reno /northern Nevada areacould really use a blitz from us, and many California retirees have relocated to those areas and are tinting  red to blue.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let Bobram&#8217;s work be in vain. And, pray Bobram doesn&#8217;t abandon his listings of newspaper contacts.</p>

I&#8217;ve contacted a key Puma in Nevada, and have asked her to write a broadcast. I suggested meeting up and teaming up of California Pumas with Nevada Pumas and blitzing the various areas. Shes&#8217;s familiar with the area and can lend her expertise there. She also has PUMA contacts in the area. </p>
<p>Between you and she, we can cull a best case plan,  coordinate, and then use the Regional moderator to broadcast to Nevada and California Pumas.</p>

<p>Sources: FBI investigating possible fraud by Fannie, Freddie, Lehman, AIG and their executives<br />
By LARA JAKES JORDAN</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) _ The FBI is investigating four major U.S. financial institutions whose collapse helped trigger a $700 billion bailout plan by the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Two law enforcement officials said the FBI is looking at potential fraud by mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., and insurer American International Group Inc.</p>
<p>A senior law enforcement official says the inquiries, still in preliminary stages, will focus on the financial institutions and the individuals that ran them.</p>
<p>Officials say the new inquiries brings the number of corporate lenders under investigation over the last year to 26.</p>

			<p>169 JamesLF on 09.23.08 at 6:59 pm I am so glad that Palin and her police chief charged women for their rape kits. We can all agree that was brilliant. They should have to pay. Not only does this reduce the city’s budget so it could be spent on more useful things like a hockey rink but also it makes them less likely to file charges. Go Palin!! Very creative.</p>
<p>**************************<br />
Don&#8217;t be ridiculous, you know these charges have been found to be false, it was the insurance company charges these women.</p>
<p>I suggest you check your facts first before just droping vile charges against Governor Palin at this web site..</p>

<p>I think there is currently an FBI investigation into at least one ACORN member who was recently involved in some fraudulent voter registration activites. Does anyone have any links to info press articles that discuss this case? I&#8217;m looking for cold, hard facts, not any media that&#8217;s about a hunch or a diatribe about ACORN. I just need articles that talk about the arrest/the case, if any exist. I thought I saw at least one on Yahoo news (might have been an AP piece) a few days ago.

			<p>MICK &#8211; MEDIA COLLECTION RELATED</p>
<p>Did you ever start collecting contact info for conservative media (like american thinker, pajamas, etc). If so, I think it would be such a great addition to the action center, especially since the msm seems to care precious little, but conservative media is likely to be more sympathetic to any letters-to-the-editor, etc. And, once something gets published in one of those publications, it gives us a stepping stone onto the next. Are you around? You up for doing it?</p>

<p>    #60 KarlaforHillary</p>
<p>McCain’s degree from the Naval Academy is in Electrical Engineering (1958). He flew jets off of aircraft carriers, and was certified to drive naval ships. All Naval Academy degrees back then were in some form of engineering.</p>
<p>    Yes he graduated 894 out 899, he is very intelligent but liked to have a good time. He was known to do well in subjects he enjoyed like literature and history, but worked just hard enough to pass other subjects he did not enjoy.</p>
<p>    Keep in mind that this is the Naval Academy of the 1950’s. It was very tough physically and mentally. Many more cadets washed out back then. McCain could have easily skated through most liberal arts schools with good grades.</p>
<p>    He was a naval aviator and squadron commander overseeing other pilots and millions of dollars of equipment.</p>
<p>    McCain attended the National War College 1973-74. Kinda like a graduate program. “The College is concerned with grand strategy and the utilization of the national resources necessary to implement that strategy… Its graduates will exercise a great influence on the formulation of national and foreign policy in both peace and war….”</p>
<p>    Mid-level and senior military officers who are likely to be promoted to the most senior ranks are selected to study at the War College in preparation for higher staff and command positions. This means that not just any bozo gets to go to the National War College.</p>
<p>    McCain retired from the Navy in April 1981 with the rank of Captain. A rank above commander and below rear admiral. It is equivalent to the rank of colonel in the other uniformed services.</p>

			<p>I just got a call on my cellphone.  It was a survey of Unaffiliated voters.  It was a robocall.  It wanted to know if I was voting for McCain, Obama or Barr.</p>
<p>I hung up, because I think it was from Obama&#8217;s campaign.  The only way they could get my cellphone # was from the County Election Office because my cellphone # has an area code from the state I moved from.  Nobody in my current state has my phone # except DMV and County Election Ofc.</p>
<p>I want to keep Obama&#8217;s team guessing.</p>
<p>The reason I know it wasn&#8217;t from my old state is because there I am an Independent, but in my new state I am considered an Unaffiliated and the recording said it was a survey for Unaffiliated voters.</p>

			<p>The way I see it Dances &#8211; is that we ALL have our own projects &#8211; that is our own platform and that has to be accomplished first &#8211; I can not fault anyone on that &#8211; thats dedication to ones own desires &#8211; the ones that I have a problem with come on start a rumor and then 50 posts react to that rumor &#8211; that is a waste &#8211; in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>I think you should go out to dinner Dances -not much going on here &#8211; you have worked all day &#8211; you have posted action items and now YOU TOO deserve a break ..<br />

			<p>In case you were wondering if they still hate us, just picked this up in the dungeon:</p>
<p>&#8220;As a progressive, I’m stunned by the self delusion and self inflicted destruction on the part of some (few) ill informed Clinton supporters who just can’t get over the fact that their candidate was beaten by a smarter, better prepared candidate. So, in a fit of pique and motivated by overblown and hysterical charges of sexism, you are prepared to vote for John McCain, a guy who cares nothing about women’s issues excepting his readiness to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>Some of you even support Sarah Palin though her rightwing radicalism bears no similarity to your own politics. You are voting on gender. So why not Ann Coulter?</p>
<p>The very sad part of your efforts is that in trying to advance a women’s agenda, many of you resorted to racism, traces of which are reflected even in the posts here.</p>
<p>You should be really proud of yourselves. Stupidity has its consequences and I can only hope you or someone you love suffers the adverse consequences of a back alley abortion.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Is there anyone else here who&#8217;s getting tired of being called a racist for not voting for Obama? I just got this email from a family member:</p>
<p>How racism works </p>
<p>&#8220;What if John McCain were a former president of the Harvard Law Review?</p>
<p>What if Barack Obama finished fifth from the bottom of his graduating class?</p>
<p>What if McCain were still married to the first woman he said &#8220;I do&#8221; to?</p>
<p>What if Obama were the candidate who left his first wife after she no longer measured up to his standards? </p>
<p>What if Michelle Obama were a wife who not only became addicted to pain killers, but acquired them illegally through her charitable organization? </p>
<p>What if Cindy McCain graduated from Harvard? </p>
<p>What if Obama were a member of the &#8220;Keating 5&#8243;? </p>
<p>What if McCain was a charismatic, eloquent speaker? </p>
<p>If these questions reflected reality, do you really believe the election numbers would be as close as they are?</p>
<p>This is what racism does. It covers up, rationalizes and minimizes positive qualities in one candidate and emphasizes negative qualities in another when there is a color difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>BTW, I&#8217;m Asian and my husband has the same ethnic background as Obama &#8212; half black, half white. Here is the response I sent back:</p>
<p>What if John McCain counted a Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan as a mentor and spiritual advisor and a former Oklahoma City terrorist as an associate? Would he still be in the running?</p>
<p>What if John McCain spent a significant portion of his legistlative career refusing to take a stand on controversial and/or important votes, instead opting time and again to vote &#8220;present&#8221;? Oh that&#8217;s right, U.S. Senators can&#8217;t vote present. Maybe that&#8217;s why Obama didn&#8217;t accomplish anything during his lengthy 143 days in the Senate.</p>
<p>Forget Michelle, Barack Obama himself admits past drug use and no one seems to care.</p>
<p>Barack Obama wouldn&#8217;t be the Democrat candidate for POTUSA if he were white. I suppose you can call reverse racism a form of racism, but it&#8217;s definitely not white racism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m amazed that someone as intelligent as you are thinks that charm, being telegenic and able to read off a teleprompter (even at a rodeo!) qualifies someone as leader of the free world.</p>
<p>I guess all my black friends who aren&#8217;t voting for Obama must hate black people too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one of them: He and his wife are among our closest friends. He&#8217;s a former Air Force officer, now a state legislator, first black man elected from this district, successful business owner: [link to his state senate website]</p>
<p>His wife (also black) won&#8217;t be voting for Obama either. I guess she&#8217;s a racist too. Matthew and I must be racists too! Heaven forbid we just don&#8217;t want a completely inexperienced, socialist-leaning, race-card playing, extreme leftist as President.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Erika</p>

			<p>Here&#8217;s an update on the weekly Vets for McCain site and weekly call.  </p>
<p>It also has the link for making phone calls for McCain if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>Good afternoon from Arlington:</p>
<p>Once again, most states will be holding Veterans Call Nights this WEDNESDAY, September 24. Those of you living in Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada, and New Jersey have your call nights on Monday (MA/NV) and Tuesday (ME/NJ) the local organizations were so aggressive and successful in getting their call nights organized that they&#8217;ll be maintaining their original schedules. Join your fellow Veterans and McCain supporters for a few hours each week a few hours a week, and you can help us make history. CLICK HERE to find the Victory Center or phone bank near you. We&#8217;re opening new offices across the battleground states, so keep checking back we may have opened a new location near you!</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t live near one of our phone banks, you can join the fight from home. Visit <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/phonebank" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnmccain.com/phonebank</a>, and you&#8217;ll be able to make a few phone calls on behalf of John McCain or Sarah Palin right from your home. The campaign is asking Veterans for McCain-Palin to produce 10,000 phone calls per week and you can help!</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget to tune in for the first presidential debate between John McCain and Barack Obama this Friday, September 26.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Lang Sias<br />
National Director<br />
Veterans for McCain-Palin</p>

			<p>I have been busy today and don&#8217;t know if this was mentioned earlier or not.  McCain was 14 electoral college numbers ahead of Obama last week.  This week (so far) Obama is THIRTY ahead of McCain.  Time is running out, and&#8230; to be honest&#8230;. I&#8217;m scared&#8230;.. God help America if we end up with a president Oblahblah!</p>

<p>I am finding some arrests this year, but the &#8220;organizations&#8221; behind the fraud are not listed as ACORN:  one was for the NAACP  and another three were in VA for some &#8220;community&#8221; organization and another were gang members in NM who had voter registration cards.  Do you only want links with the Acorn name?  I don&#8217;t want to be accused of not doing anything here, but I am trying to research for you.</p>

<p>How smart could these people be, if all that damaging information is out there about Obama, plus his inexperience, unremarkable senatorial record and flip-flopping on issues, coupled with his fear of town hall meetings, clinging to his teleprompter and faux presidential seal.</p>
<p>Calling non-supporters of Obama racists is due to lack of a valid response on their part.</p>

I was struck to the point of more anger at the tone of Dodd and Bayh, but especially Dodd, in his comments to people there.  He acted as if he and others had nothing to do with this Financial Debacle, This sob and his committee did nothing , said nothing, acted as if nothing was happening re Freddie and Fannie and Investment Banks for two straight years&#8230;and now he and others, on this committee, Repulicans and Democrats posture , each and every one about us&#8230;us&#8230;the taxpayer.

			<p>#307 NewOrleansPuma &#8211; It has been a while since I responded to your post.<br />
 I watched that damn thing while working out. A thought occurred to me -</p>
<p> Murphy, you read up too -</p>
<p>While the financial crisis was unfolding a few months back boneheaded Congressmen were interviewing / questioning Roger Clemens, his trainer and another person in a committee meeting and a lot of media were covering it. They should have actually been taking care of the Capital market than the Ball Game has been&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Can we do this, Murphy in HRC 2012?<br />
Perhaps you, NewOrleansPuma, Asian, Osaka, 1gypsy4mc and all PUMA&#8217;s fill the room and question Congressmen instead for their actions (or lack of it). Would that not be wonderful to actually question Congressman. We could end up being people&#8217;s representatives and give dumb Congressmen a taste of their own medicine.<br />
Ok, I drank a couple. Hence I am hallucinating. Perhaps this is what I have in common with BOBIDEN. So don&#8217;t vote me and don&#8217;t vote BOBIDEN either.</p>

			<p>NewOrleansPuma&#8211;</p>
<p>Earlier today I was having a difference of opinion with my sister, who is an English teacher, and you wrote this to me:</p>
<p>#60Karlafor Hillary: Obama himself has said more than once on the written record that he learned more in his few years of practicing the Alinsky method of so called organizing than he had ever learned in both his undergraduate time and his time at Harvard….<br />
Does your sister even know anything about this method and the epistemology of it? ..meaning…its purpose, and how , what, it “teaches” to the human mind? The entire method’s purpose is to teach the total deconstruction of every habit of logic and rational thought for the purpose of producing a pragmatic result….Is this what your sister would call the effects of education that Obama has, according to her? Is this what she and every other teacher, including myself, spend years attempting to teach our students to do?<br />
Is not the function of a teacher the opposite? How to penetrate that which interferes with discovery of the truth, not how to practice those techniques to hide, destroy, deconstruct or subvert it? Your sister, for all of her so called education, has been brainwashed and is herself espousing her own elitist position. Send her this post and ask her to respond, here…will you? I hope so.<br />
For the love of your sister and the truth, she is lucky to have you. Keep at it!</p>
<p>Well, here is her nasty response. I&#8217;m sorry if it makes you angry. This is what I deal with on a daily or weekly basis:</p>
<p>Send this to the walking thesaurus.</p>
<p>To whom it concerns:<br />
I read your blog, and you are correct in one of your comments; I am not aware of the Alinsky method. However, I do not appreciate you hacking on my &#8220;so-called education&#8221; as you so blatantly put it. How dare you say that I am brainwashed and harboring an elitist position. You do not know me. I am far from an elitist. In my classroom I teach my students to be willing to disagree and to voice their opinions, but I insist that they do so RESPECTFULLY&#8211;a skill which you are evidently not aware of. You have insulted not only my education, but also my integrity as a contributing member of the blue collar work force in this country. I feel sincerely sorry for your students. I hope that when they disagree with your political views that you treat them with more respect than you have for me.</p>

I have always said &#8220;Give them enough rope and they will hand themselves&#8221;&#8230;I pray Hillary will not give in to the request for her to step in for VP..I introduced myself as a Puma at the RNC Hdqts and they were very interested in knowing would Hillary accept the VP? I said not to worry she would not because she will be running in 2012 and she will be our President.  They also said, the RNC were so relieved to hear that Hillary would not be the Choosen one and that they were really worried.  If Hillary were the Nominee then they (RNC) knew they would not stand a chance of winning..Now, they know with a alot of work the McCain/Palin ticket will win and I will help them..</p>

Now, with regards to that T-shirt of that poor child, I have never heard of such a thing.  Students in my building wear pro-61 and pro-McCain shirts all the time.  Political activism is not against the dress code; it is encouraged.  What is against the dress code are things like shirts with alcohol or drug slogans on them because of the underage factor.  It&#8217;s not like the slogan he wore wasn&#8217;t true&#8230;.it wasn&#8217;t libel.  Thank goodness this didn&#8217;t take place at my school&#8211;who needs that kind of lawsuit.</p>

			<p>MY POSTINGS</p>
<p>For the last three days, I have been going to <a href="http://www.topix.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.topix.com/</a> and posting what is below in the appropriate places.  If someone is not familiar with topix, if you want a particular city and state you can find it by tying in SEARCH the name of the city and state and then topix and it will take you to what that city/ state is posting about.  I have been following Obama&#8217;s campaign events and posting in those cities and states.  </p>
<p>What I have been posting:</p>
<p>If the subject is the economy, I post this:</p>
<p>“I join as a cosponsor of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005,<br />
S. 190, to underscore my support for quick passage of GSE regulatory reform legislation.<br />
If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the<br />
enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall<br />
financial system, and the economy as a whole.<br />
I urge my colleagues to support swift action on this GSE reform legislation.” &#8211; John<br />
McCain 2005</p>
<p>Legislation failed.</p>
<p>The failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could have been averted IF Federal Housing<br />
Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 had been passed.</p>
<p>Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 only had three co-sponsors :<br />
Elizabeth Dole, John McCain and John Sununu. For Nancy Pelosi blaming the GOP is<br />
downright an insult to ALL of US TAXPAYERS!</p>
<p><a href="http://beltwaysnark.com/2008/09/16/john-mccain-supported-a-proposal-for-an-agency-to-" rel="nofollow">http://beltwaysnark.com/2008/09/16/john-mccain-supported-a-proposal-for-an-agency-to-</a><br />

<p><a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s109-190" rel="nofollow">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s109-190</a></p>
<p>Gee, and who did the now Government financed mortgage broker Fannie Mae give its<br />
money to when it wanted to influence a politician?</p>
<p>OpenSecrets lists the top three politicians in which FNMA “invested” from 1989 to 2008.</p>
<p>Top Recipients of Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Campaign Contributions, 1989-2008Name<br />
Office State Party Grand Total</p>
<p>Dodd, Christopher S CT D $165,400<br />
Obama, Barack S IL D $126,349 ($6000 came from the PAC)<br />
Kerry, John S MA D $111,000</p>
<p>What about McCain?</p>
<p>The folks at Fannie Mae didn’t show him a lot of love. According to Open Secrets:</p>
<p>McCain, John S AZ R $21,550 (all from individuals).</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and who tabbed the former head of Fannie Mae to head up his Vice Presidential<br />
search team? OBAMA, that’s who. Back in May Barack turned to Jim Johnson, former<br />
CEO of Fannie Mae.   </p>
<p>(end of the above post)</p>
<p>If  the subject is about Obama and the election  I post this:</p>
<p>We are the ones that Obama is not expecting. </p>
<p><a href="http://justsaynodeal.com/index2.html" rel="nofollow">http://justsaynodeal.com/index2.html</a></p>
<p>PUMA POWER</p>
<p>(end of the post)</p>
<p>And, anytime I think it is appropriate which is not often (Actually, I don&#8217;t know how I feel about this, but it seems to ignite the other posters/readers), I post this:</p>
<p>REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY</p>
<p>&#8220;I consistently believe that when it comes to whether it&#8217;s Native Americans or African-<br />
American issues or reparations, the most important thing for the U.S. government to do is<br />
not just offer words, but offer deeds.&#8221;  &#8211;  Barack Obama July 2008 in a meeting with<br />
UNITY &#8217;08, an event for minority journalists in Chicago, IL</p>
<p>DEEDS?  ($$$$$)</p>
<p>After waiting nearly two decades, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) is well positioned to<br />
move legislation that could lead the federal government to apologize for slavery and pay<br />
reparations. </p>
<p>But the Judiciary Committee chairman is willing to wait a little longer, when he hopes<br />
Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) will be in the White House. </p>
<p>A reparations plan  could extract several trillion dollars from American taxpayers&#8217;<br />
pockets. </p>
<p>In January of 1989, Mr. Conyers first introduced the bill H.R. 40, the Commission to<br />
Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act. He has reintroduced H.R. 40<br />
every Congress since 1989, and will continue to do so until it&#8217;s passed into law. </p>
<p>Mr. Conyers has requested the number of the bill, 40, as a symbol of the forty acres and a<br />
mule that the United States initially promised freed slaves. This unfulfilled promise and<br />
the serious devastation that slavery had on African-American lives has never been<br />
officially recognized by the United States Government</p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnconyers.com/issues/reparations" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnconyers.com/issues/reparations</a></p>
<p>Barack Obama&#8217;s former pastor The Reverend Jeremiah Wright was the keynote speaker at<br />
the 2007 annual conference of N&#8217;COBRA, which stands for the National Coalition of<br />
Blacks for Reparations in America.</p>
<p>Not only are members of Obama&#8217;s former church involved in the reparations movement,<br />
Obama&#8217;s politically close friend former Chicago Alderman Dorothy Wright Tillman led<br />
an effort by the Chicago City Council to demand reparations for slavery.  Chicago has<br />
become the de facto center of  the slavery reparations movement.</p>

<p>snowtiger: Maybe it is just that we have a small school low on gang activity.  It&#8217;s interesting though: all our students seem to know who we support politically.  We even have a government class where part of their assignment is de-bunking campaign ads (of either campaign).  I&#8217;ve never seen politics in school this much prior to this campaign.</p>

			<p>Karla &#8212; if your sister is reading I hope she reads this. It is elitist to assume that Sarah Palin is worthy of ridicule because of the exclusivity (or lack thereof) of her alma mater.</p>
<p>It is uninformed not to know that John McCain&#8217;s educational background is, in fact, quite elite.</p>
<p>New Orleans Puma is many things, but elitist she is not.</p>
<p>She is fearsomely smart, poetical, mystical, and badass.</p>
<p>I think your sister&#8217;s feelings were hurt, and for that I am sorry. I bet she has a big heart like yours Karla &#8212; she probably cares as much about your opinion of her as you sincerely do about her opinion of you.</p>
<p>We all want to be right &#8212; to be on the winning team &#8212; to have our hunches validated and our fears assuaged.</p>
<p>Karla&#8217;s Sister &#8212; don&#8217;t be offended. We wanted to help her talk to you by giving her facts and evidence-based opinions. You may never agree with us &#8212; you may be right after all is said and done. For all I know Barack Obama could be elected and turn out to be the greatest president in history. I doubt it and I have rational reasons for doubting it &#8212; but I know I dont know.</p>
<p>Your sister clearly wants your good opinion &#8212; she doesnt want to browbeat you but persuade you with good arguments.</p>
<p>There are some amazingly experienced commenters here. The cumulative years and knowledge of the women and men who comment here are beyond my ken. I try to hold them all in my head at once and fail every time.</p>
<p>We are citizens here &#8212; informed to the degree that we read, research, and learn. Some of us may have fancy advanced degrees and such, but most of us dont. we talk and we pay attention, we watch &#8212; but mostly, we LISTEN. That is our singular strength. Pumas LISTEN.</p>
<p>We heard Karla this morning and tried to help &#8212; help her help you, as cuba gooding jr. said.</p>
<p>dont be offended &#8212; it will only keep you more isolated from your sister.</p>

<p>I am from a small town and I think the teachers in our school get away with more than they should sometimes. During the primaries, my daughter had a Life Choices/Home Ec. teacher who was a big Obama fan. One day she made the kids watch a speech given by Obama, and she talked about how great he was because he was all about change. The next day they had to watch a McCain speech.  Supposedly she wanted them to view a democrat and a republican. However, they never got to watch a speech by Hillary or anyone else. When the kids questioned her as to why they couldn&#8217;t watch speeches by some of the other candidates, they were told that we don&#8217;t always get what we want in life.</p>

<p>Dodd (not sure about Bayh) was one of the benefactors of a sweetheart deal on his house. Been awhile so I don&#8217;t remember which company it was that he got preferential treatment from. Supposedly, these people were being investigated (including nobo). Dodd insisted his association with these mortgage companies would NOT effect his running the Senate Banking Committee.

			<p>headclunker &#8212; right on. my first dude has an ee degree from a prestigious school, though less prestigious than Annapolis (where his father graduated with a bsee) and it KICKED HIS A**</p>
<p>He is really, really smart, but he graduated with like a 2.2 gpa or something. An electrical engineering degree from a tough tech school is NOTHING to sneeze at. </p>
<p>Honestly, McCain is probly the first candidate since Clinton to be worthy of admiration for his academic achievements. Kerry and Gore are clearly smart, accomplished guys, but hey &#8212; their backgrounds made it practically impossible for them to fail.</p>

			<p>Hi, all.  I received an email tonight bashing Sarah Palin.  I found it so offensive to women.  Here is the email in its original form.  Then I&#8217;ll post my response!<br />
I&#8217;m a little confused. Let me see if I have this straight…..</p>
<p>If you grow up in Hawaii, raised by your grandparents, you&#8217;re &#8216;exotic, different.&#8217;</p>
<p>But if you grow up in Alaska eating mooseburgers, you are the quintessential American story.</p>
<p>If your name is Barack you&#8217;re a radical, unpatriotic Muslim.</p>
<p>But if you name your kids Willow, Trig and Track, you&#8217;re a maverick.</p>
<p>If you graduate from Harvard law School, you are unstable.</p>
<p>But if you attend 5 different small colleges before graduating, you&#8217;re well grounded.</p>
<p>If you spend 3 years as a brilliant community organizer, become the first black President of the Harvard Law Review, create a voter registration drive that registers 150,000 new voters, spend 12 years as a Constitutional Law professor, spend 8 years as a State Senator representing a district with over 750,000 people, become chairman of the state Senate&#8217;s Health and Human Services committee, spend 4 years in the United States Senate representing a state of 13 million people while sponsoring 131 bills and serving on the Foreign Affairs, Environment and Public Works and Veteran&#8217;s Affairs committees, you don&#8217;t have any real leadership experience.</p>
<p>But If your total resume is: local weather girl, 4 years on the city council and 6 years as the mayor of a town with less than 7,000 people, 20 months as the governor of a state with only 650,000 people, then you&#8217;re qualified to become the country&#8217;s second highest ranking official.</p>
<p>If you have been married to the same woman for 19 years while raising 2 beautiful daughters, all within Protestant churches, you&#8217;re not a real Christian.</p>
<p>But if you cheated on your first wife with a rich heiress, and left your disfigured wife and married the heiress the next month, or if you speak in tongues then you&#8217;re a Christian.</p>
<p>If you teach your children about sexual predators, you are irresponsible and eroding the fiber of society.</p>
<p>But if, while governor, you staunchly advocate abstinence only, with no other option in sex education in your state&#8217;s school system while your unwed teen daughter ends up pregnant, you&#8217;re very responsible.</p>
<p>If your wife is a Harvard graduate laywer who gave up a position in a prestigious law firm to work for the betterment of her inner city community, then gave that up to raise a family, your family&#8217;s values don&#8217;t represent America&#8217;s.</p>
<p>But if your husband is nicknamed &#8216;First Dude&#8217;, with at least one DWI conviction and no college education, who didn&#8217;t register to vote until age 25 and once was a member of a group that hates America and advocated the secession of Alaska from the USA, your family is extremely admirable.</p>
<p>OK, much clearer now.</p>

<p>On the radio program I listen to while driving to work, this morning, they said there is no true rationale as to why people are supporting Bo other than its the hip thing to do<br />
*********************************************</p>
<p>I think this point out one important aspect of this election: a great number of people will vote based on emotional and not factual issues.</p>
<p>This may well be one main reason why empty suit BO has been doing well by exploiting sexism, racism to his advantage. He (with the help of MSM) knows how to cast an attractive image of himself to a certain segment of the public and it works.</p>
<p>My point is this: It seems to me Pumas have been focusing more on issues and facts; maybe we should also have a second track that focus on pushing people’s emotional buttons? IMHO</p>

ARTICLE POSTING SUGGESTION<br />
Anyone who wants to post an entire article (not just the link) has to pay for ad time! Maybe $5 or $10. What do you think?<br />
————————–<br />
Anna, Amen!!<br />
I think $5, or more, for anything longer than one to two standard summary paragraphs of an article with link.<br />
and<br />
$5 charge for links or Youtubes that aren’t accompanied by a sentence describing what their content.</p>
<p>Think of all the time and space we could save, to say nothing of the vast amounts that would be contributed to Puma PAC.<br />
_________________________________________</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re being &#8220;required&#8221; to pay for communicating here&#8230;what did I log into the DNC of Obama site by mistake???????????????????????????????</p>
<p>Some people give what they can for the effort and many of us have NOTHING to give but our communications and efforts&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..so if that is the way it&#8217;s going to be then I&#8217;ve been associating with the wrong group all this time.</p>

			<p>This is a reponse to the Palin smear email I received today!<br />
&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>What does it make you if you&#8217;re a junior senator who thinks there are 57 states and you&#8217;re running for president?   Just saying is all.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGH02DtIws" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpGH02DtIws</a> </p>
<p>This was fun.  Thanks for the challenge, sort of.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you grow up in Hawaii, raised by your grandparents, you&#8217;re &#8216;exotic, different.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>I think we should all be proud of Obama for rising the ladder after being born from a single mother who chose not to abort him.  She gave him a chance, and he is now running for president. </p>
<p>&#8220;But if you grow up in Alaska eating mooseburgers, you are the quintessential American story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valid point and I&#8217;m sure a lot of thought went into this one.  Heard it&#8217;s low in cholesterol and tastes like chicken.  Kind of like saying, &#8220;He&#8217;s a bad presidential candidate because he eats too much fried chicken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If your name is Barack you&#8217;re a radical, unpatriotic Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barack called himself Muslim:  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVn59TC2QqM&#038;feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVn59TC2QqM&#038;feature=related</a></p>
<p>Barack&#8217;s pastor preaching &#8220;God Damn America&#8221; probably would qualify as radical, but what do I know?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH5ixmT83JE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH5ixmT83JE</a></p>
<p>Barack&#8217;s affiliation with William Ares (known terrorist) and Louis Farrakhan (Jew-hater and American hater) are better indications of  Obama being a radical, unpatriotic muslim.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you name your kids Willow, Trig and Track, you&#8217;re a maverick.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you go against your own political party to fight corruption = maverick.<br />
Naming your kids Willow, Trig and Track = creative.<br />
Voting &#8220;present&#8221; on issues instead of taking a stand = typical Washington politician.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you graduate from Harvard law School, you are unstable.&#8221;</p>
<p>  Yeah, lawyers, I hear a special place is reserved for lawyers in heaven&#8230;or maybe that was hell.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you attend 5 different small colleges before graduating, you&#8217;re well grounded.&#8221;</p>
<p> Sounds like a knock on middle America.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you spend 3 years as a brilliant community organizer, become the first black President of the Harvard Law Review, create a voter registration drive that registers 150,000 new voters, spend 12 years as a Constitutional Law professor, spend 8 years as a State Senator representing a district with over 750,000 people, become chairman of the state Senate&#8217;s Health and Human Services committee, spend 4 years in the United States Senate representing a state of 13 million people while sponsoring 131 bills and serving on the Foreign Affairs, Environment and Public Works and Veteran&#8217;s Affairs committees, you don&#8217;t have any real leadership experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>    One, has this guy ever had a real job in the private sector, and, two, have you ever been to Illinois?  But let&#8217;s take them one at a time.</p>
<p>     &#8220;If you spend 3 years as a brilliant community organizer&#8221; &#8211;  That is why Chicago is so great .</p>
<p>   &#8220;become the first black President of the Harvard Law Review&#8221;  &#8211;   He even wrote one article for the Harvard Law Review.</p>
<p>  &#8220;create a voter registration drive that registers 150,000 new voters&#8221; &#8211;    Oh, you mean ACORN which is tied to voter fraud and money laundering &#8211; see <a href="http://noquarterusa.net/blog/2008/07/16/obama%E2%80%99s-acorn-a-leftist-social-reform-group-part-ii/" rel="nofollow">http://noquarterusa.net/blog/2008/07/16/obama%E2%80%99s-acorn-a-leftist-social-reform-group-part-ii/</a>.  Hey, 150,00 new voters is 150,000 new voters.  Who cares if they&#8217;re dead when they registered!   Don&#8217;t believe me.  Do your own homework</p>
<p>&#8220;spend 12 years as a Constitutional Law professor&#8221;  So he never practiced law, then?</p>
<p>&#8220;spend 8 years as a State Senator representing a district with over 750,000 people&#8221; &#8211; and it is still a hell hole with 750,000 people.  While Obama got richer, Chicago got poorer.  </p>
<p>&#8220;become chairman of the state Senate&#8217;s Health and Human Services committee&#8221;  &#8211; And that is why Illinois has the best healthcare system in the U.S. because of&#8230;.  Oh, wait.  </p>
<p> &#8220;spend 4 years in the United States Senate representing a state of 13 million people while sponsoring 131 bills&#8221;  &#8211;   Sponsoring a bill = Signing your name to someone else&#8217;s bill</p>
<p>Number of sponsored bills: 70<br />
Number of sponsored bills passed: 0 </p>
<p>Number of co-sponsored bills: 404<br />
Number of co-sponsored bills passed: 8</p>
<p>America, get ready!</p>
<p>&#8220;serving on the Foreign Affairs, Environment and Public Works and Veteran&#8217;s Affairs committees&#8221;  Such as?????  And accomplishing&#8230;.????</p>
<p>&#8220;But If your total resume is: local weather girl (demeaning &#8211; she was a sports anchor), 4 years on the city council and 6 years as the mayor of a town with less than 7,000 people, 20 months as the governor of a state with only 650,000 people, then you&#8217;re qualified to become the country&#8217;s second highest ranking official.&#8221;     </p>
<p>Real Jobs = Real American all while raising a family</p>
<p>She is a woman, NOT A GIRL!</p>
<p>Hey, isn&#8217;t 4 + 6 + 1.6 = 11.6 years of public service?  </p>
<p>And Obama has, ewww, four? </p>
<p>And Biden, well, he almost got as many votes running for President of the US as Sarah Palin got running for MAYOR of Wasilla, which as above points out, has a population of less than 7,000.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have been married to the same woman for 19 years while raising 2 beautiful daughters, all within Protestant churches, you&#8217;re not a real Christian.&#8221;  &#8211; go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com</a> and search &#8220;Jeremiah Wright&#8221;  Depends upon what your definition of &#8220;christian&#8221; is.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you cheated on your first wife with a rich heiress, and left your disfigured wife and married the heiress the next month, or if you speak in tongues then you&#8217;re a Christian.&#8221;</p>
<p>it makes him a politician</p>
<p>&#8220;If you teach your children about sexual predators, you are irresponsible and eroding the fiber of society. &#8221;</p>
<p>     Sex education = sexual predators ???  Really?  If you say so&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if, while governor, you staunchly advocate abstinence only, with no other option in sex education in your state&#8217;s school system while your unwed teen daughter ends up pregnant, you&#8217;re very responsible.&#8221; &#8211; </p>
<p>  $#!^ happens</p>
<p>&#8220;If your wife is a Harvard graduate lawyer who gave up a position in a prestigious law firm to work for the betterment of her inner city community, then gave that up to raise a family, your family&#8217;s values don&#8217;t represent America&#8217;s.&#8221;  &#8211; It was to actually campaign for her husband.  It is well documented that she quit ONLY to help her husband campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if your husband is nicknamed &#8216;First Dude&#8217;, with at least one DWI conviction and no college education, who didn&#8217;t register to vote until age 25 and once was a member of a group that hates America and advocated the secession of Alaska from the USA, your family is extremely admirable.&#8221;</p>
<p>   DWI over 20 years ago doesn&#8217;t equal a presidential candidate who admittedly had a drug addiction to illegal drugs</p>
<p>&#8220;once was a member of a group that hates America&#8221;  </p>
<p>Does being a member of  Reverend Jeremiah Wright&#8217;s church count:  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_1jqmURn9M" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_1jqmURn9M</a>  </p>
<p>How about being supported by someone who refers to Jews as a gutter religion?</p>
<p>If Osama wins I might revisit the First Dude with his secession of Alaska from the USA</p>
<p>Hey,  good luck with this guy!</p>

			<p>CTkey and Others &#8212; Just watch bill pull this rabbit out of his hat.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton was a MASTER politician in 1992- 16 long and formative years ago &#8212; he has moved beyond mastery at this point.</p>
<p>The ONLY 2-term Democratic President since FDR?? The only President in living memory to preside over an era of peace AND prosperity? Wealthy beyond his wildest Arkansas dreams? Beloved around the world for his achievements, his contributions, his charm, his political acumen, and his compassion? Married for life to the greatest public woman since Eleanor Roosevelt? Father to a devoted, responsible, and hilarious daughter who loves him as much as she loves her mother?</p>
<p>Survivor of a heart attack that shrunk all of his material accomplishment down to the level of lines in a NYT obituary? He looked death in the eye and came up grateful and fearless. Bill Clinton knows what he&#8217;s doing. He could talk on autopilot ten years ago. Today he approaches political perfection. He owes nobody nothing. well, except Hillary. He still owes her.</p>

<p>No offense taken. I kind of agree with you. It was one of those instances when my husband and I had to decide if we were going to step in and have a discussion with the principal or not. We chose to let it go this time to save the kids any kind of retaliation. Normally, I don&#8217;t have any problems with this particular teacher.

			<p>#332 snowtiger &#8211; That is true.<br />
My honest opinion &#8211; A teacher is just supposed to impart academic education. I doubt political science is a 5th grade subject.<br />
My sarcasm here &#8211; But in 5th grade they still learn to count, substract and read, I think.<br />
Tax payer view &#8211; A school teacher working on a salary within a school system funded by property taxes of locals must not in any way canvass for local, state and national candidates. Even if she canvasses for HRC 2012, I would object. Outside of her school let he go to hell(BOWORLD)<br />
This is what happens when parents don&#8217;t have control on what is taught to their kids.<br />
Sad, but perhaps this is another definition for, listen up ROLAND MARTIN, COMMUNITY ORGANIZING</p>

			<p>TerryDo you&#8217;re right.  He did say good things about Todd Palin.  He tried to talk his way out of the Wright fiasco, but didn&#8217;t really succeed.  Since it seemed like he ALMOST endorsed McCain at his last interview, I guess I was hoping he&#8217;d do about the same here and not say how BO was &#8220;the answer&#8221; for the world today&#8230;.</p>

			<p>Karla for Hillary: I  just read your sister&#8217;s response .<br />
Have no fear.  I found her response neither material enough to provoke anger nor substantive to the issue I raised as a counter to her reason, according to you , for her voting for Obama to provoke anger. The response does in fact reveal the inability to separate idea from feeling and confrontration of an issue from an attack on self.  Since your sister acknowledges she has no knowledge of the Alinsky method, and since my post spoke to Obama.s own judgment about the value of the education received at the institutions your sister sited as reason to vote for him relative to the Alinsky method, then her personal comments regarding me and herself are all she has to speak about in this regard.  Ironically, it is elitist to value something in and of itself as the sole basis for a judgement when in fact the person(Obama) who holds that so called education does in fact value another education beyond any received in these institutions,..i.e. your sister knows even more than Bo himself what to value&#8230;.<br />
Regarding my time in the classroom and my students, I did not express political opinions in a classroom, as my opinion is no better than another opinion.  A classroom is about the nature of ideas, the logic and rationale for those ideas, the nature of thought  and how the human mind comes to that thought.  If all we do in a class is express opinion and do it respectfully, then no wonder so many come from so called on paper good schools and continue to reveal to follow a thought that goes on for more than one minute&#8230;the time of an ad&#8230;.Dear Sister: Go read Rules for Radicals and come back here to talk about ideas.   Or pray for my poor bad ass, certainly I , and this country need it.</p>

			<p>From: Minister of the Treasury Paulson<br />
Subject: REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP</p>
<p>Dear American:<br />
I need to ask you to support an urgent secret business relationship with a transfer of funds of great magnitude.</p>
<p>I am Ministry of the Treasury of the Republic of America. My country has had crisis that has caused the need for large transfer of funds of 800 billion dollars US. If you would assist me in this transfer, it would be most profitable to you.</p>
<p>I am working with Mr. Phil Gram, lobbyist for UBS, who will be my replacement as Ministry of the Treasury in January. As a Senator, you may know him as the leader of the American banking deregulation movement in the 1990s. This transaction is 100% safe.<br />
This is a matter of great urgency. We need a blank check. We need the funds as quickly as possible. We cannot directly transfer these funds in the names of our close friends because we are constantly under surveillance. My family lawyer advised me that I should look for a reliable and trustworthy person who will act as a next of kin so the funds can be transferred.</p>
<p>Please reply with all of your bank account, IRA and college fund account numbers and those of your children and grandchildren to </p>
<p><a href="mailto:wallstreetbailout@treasury.gov">wallstreetbailout@treasury.gov</a> </p>
<p>so that we may transfer your commission for this transaction. After I receive that information, I will respond with detailed information about safeguards that will be used to protect the funds.</p>
<p>Yours Faithfully<br />
Minister of Treasury Paulson</p>

			<p>TOPIC: Bill Clinton on FOX tonite</p>
<p>Did everyone enjoy watching Bill get interviewed on FOX news tonight? I had so many favorite parts, I’m sure you did, too.</p>
<p>Let’s make a list!</p>
<p>1. I liked the long pause when he was deciding how to answer about Rev Wright…</p>
<p>next??</p>
<p>I liked that he kept his arms folded most of the time.  (We need a body language person to analyze)<br />
next??</p>

			<p>Bill on FOX NEWS<br />
Our list so far (added another, haha):</p>
<p>1. I liked the long pause when he was deciding how to answer about Rev Wright…<br />
2. I liked the way he indirectly said that Todd Palin is a man’s man unlike he who cannot be named. TerryDo<br />
3. I liked that he kept his arms folded most of the time. (We need a body language person to analyze)<br />
next??<br />
4. I liked the fact he speaks so well extemporaneously, and seemed to genuinely like Sarah Palin &amp; her hubby.</p>
<p>Copy this list &amp; keep it going!!</p>

AND, what&#8217;s the point of having all those resources if folks don&#8217;t use them. Everything you need is right there. There are even sample letters and talking points. You can cut and paste the media links.

			<p>Just for curiosity&#8230; let&#8217;s do a &#8220;let&#8217;s pretend&#8221; once here.  &#8220;let&#8217;s pretend&#8221; that the rumor is true and Biden does step down after the Veep debate and &#8220;let&#8217;s pretend&#8221; that Hillary IS offered the Veep spot instead.  How many of you think she will take it?  Yes, Bill Clinton said in a previous interview that she didn&#8217;t want the VP spot; but how many say that and then end up taking it later?  Just wondering what you think.  It is possible that Hillary just might think that because BO would be the first black pres he just might (again, &#8220;let&#8217;s pretend&#8221;) be knocked off and she&#8217;d step into the presidency.  Think that might be enough motivation for her to accept?  Any thoughts on this?  That&#8217;s question #1&#8230; question #2 would be, how many would vote for BO if Hillary were the Veep on the ticket?</p>

That lady is &#8220;Jen&#8221;.  She lived in my town in Calif.  for about a year.  She rides her bike and skates naked.  Here she wore pasties to stay within the law. She was the talk of the town and many here did not like her skating around town because of the kids.   She left because they would not let her in the 4th of July parade.  She then moved to Ashland, Oregon (no nudity laws) then on to Portland.  She is actually very nice and likes to sing and perform naked in public places.</p>

			<p>Today I quit a political discussion group that I have belonged to since 2002. I got tired of personal attacks by Obamaites. </p>
<p>I have mostly lurked on this blog, but I have followed several of the discussions from time to time. I would like to share some things with the members who sometimes get their feelings hurt by &#8216;more educated&#8217; members of their families. </p>
<p>I am a home schooler. I was also a debater in high school. Put the two things together, and you get a home school debate coach for the association. We sent 5 teams in the last 8 years to nationals. (I tell you this as background.)</p>
<p>In any debate (discussion) there is usually the introduction of evidence to back up an opinion. For instance if we say Obama is corrupt, then we should have some proof of that corruption. If we say that Hillary was bashed in the media, we also can back up that claim. One major tactic of poor debaters is to attack the source of one&#8217;s evidence. If that source is some conservative group, the opposition may say the source is biased. If you defend the source with additional sources, or simply state a reasoned answer that requires no evidence, they will, almost inevitably, make a personal attack on you. It might be your education, or you family background, your religion, or your profession. I have even had some on the discussion group attack my children!</p>
<p>The one major thing to keep in mind if you are scoring a debate in competition:<br />
THE INSTANT THEY CROSS THE LINE AND MAKE A PERSONAL ATTACK, THEY JUST LOST THE DEBATE! </p>
<p>Generally people who use this tactic are poor debaters who have not learned how to actually argue effectively. They most often have taken one side or the other, and cannot see any possible rationale for a differing point of view. In competitive debate, the participants are required to debate both sides of an issue. Sometimes I think we should make our politicians do the same. If they did, we would surely have a more balanced government.</p>
<p>Sorry this is so long, but I felt I needed to share.</p>

If you want to know what Barak Obama has planned, go to Wikipedia and read the section on Saul Alinsky.  It would be a good idea to copy and store this information offline if you can as the bots will try to manipulate or remove it when they discover we are on to them.<br />
Additionally, I think it would be a good idea to tell the bots to go and read this themselves if they haven&#8217;t already.  Then ask them how it feels to be played and if this is what they want in the Whitehouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obama dumps Biden<br />
  DNC dumps Obama<br />
  The real democrats from the United States of America bring the only candidate worth to be selected as the real Democratic nominee !!! The DNC decides to go back to the roots for which it was founded many years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I like this scenario better:</p>
<p>1. DNC kicks Obama off the ticket after he is served with papers for something very illegal<br />
2. Hillary moves to top of the ticket<br />
3. A few days later, Hillary selects somebody else to be VP, someone cool we haven&#8217;t thought of yet!</p>
<p>p.s. remember it was Einstein who said:<br />
 &#8220;Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life&#8217;s coming attractions.&#8221;</p>

<p>********************************</p>
<p>Your comment reminds me of one of my favorite poems and I thought I would share it with you, although I think you might already know this poem.</p>
<p>A Reason, a Season, or a Lifetime</p>
<p>People come into your life for a reason, a season, or<br />
a lifetime. When you figure out which one it is, you<br />
will know what to do for each person.</p>
<p>When someone is in your life for a REASON . . .<br />
 It is usually to meet a need you have expressed.<br />
They have come to assist you through a difficulty,<br />
 to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically,emotionally, or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they are! </p>
<p>They are there for the reason you need them to be.</p>
<p>Then, without any wrong doing on your part, or at an<br />
inconvenient time, this person will say or do something<br />
to bring the relationship to an end.</p>
<p>Sometimes they die.<br />
Sometimes they walk away.<br />
Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand.</p>
<p>What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you<br />
sent up has been answered. And now it is time to move on.</p>

			<p>Yes, Campbell Brown lost the debate. </p>
<p>One of the most difficult personal attacks to defend against is the attack on your intentions by an opponent. This kind of attack is where someone says: You obviously think this or that, or feel this of that, therefore you are not being rational about the object of the discussion. This is what C. Brown did when she called Lynn Rothschild bitter. How does Campbell know what is in Lynn&#8217;s head? Or what emotion, if any, motivates her to put her support somewhere besides Obama? </p>
<p>This is really a form of character assisination, or attack on someone&#8217;s character. It is petty, and should never be used in a debate or an interview. It is, for the most part, disrespectful. If one uses it, one loses the debate, if they are in competition!</p>

			<p>KarenWi: First, that is not going to happen,i.e., Hillary being put on as VP. Even if it did, that subject has been discussed very thoroughly here, early on the debacle of the June 3 suspension of Hillary&#8217;s campaign and beyond that until the convention.  Murphy, founder of the Pac, has stated she would not vote for Obama if Mother Theresa were the VP. I, someone you know, have said I woud not vote for Obimbo if my favorite, Joan of Arc were the VP and sweet Jesus, whom I love, came down and told me to do so..I would exert my right of free will and tell Him, No.  Others here have expressed their rejection of the idea, although I am not  attempting  to give you,because I can not,  give you a summary of the positions of all members.<br />
The 28% of former Hillary Supporters who , according to some polls still reject Obimbo, is firm.  It is based on him. I do not think it can be moved at this point. Our goal is to assure that more HC supporters who currently are on the fence do not fall over to his sleze side.  Regarding the other theoretical issue, &#8220;knocked off&#8221;&#8230;This Pac hasn&#8217;t and I do not believe woud discuss that theoretical here. I know I won&#8217;t.</p>

****************</p>
<p>Murphy and Henerietta here is the whole poem.</p>
<p>A Reason, a Season, or a Lifetime</p>
<p>People come into your life for a reason, a season, or<br />
a lifetime. When you figure out which one it is, you<br />
will know what to do for each person.</p>
<p>When someone is in your life for a REASON . . .<br />
 It is usually to meet a need you have expressed.<br />
They have come to assist you through a difficulty,<br />
 to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically,emotionally, or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they are! They are there for the reasonyou need them to be.</p>
<p>Then, without any wrong doing on your part, or at an<br />

<p>Sometimes they die.<br />

<p>What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you<br />
sent up has been answered. And now it is time to move on.</p>
<p>When people come into your life for a SEASON . . .<br />
Because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn.<br />
They bring you an experience of peace, or make you laugh.<br />
They may teach you something you have never done.<br />
They usually give you an unbelievable amount<br />
of joy. Believe it! It is real! But, only for a season.</p>
<p>LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons; things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said<br />
that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant. </p>

			<p>OT but this is very important political news:</p>
<p>Congress is getting SLAMMED with Anti Bailout phone calls and faxes. They are actually talking about it in the Halls of Congress!!! It is swaying a lot of minds.</p>
<p>PLEASE!!! If you are anti this Wall Street Bailout, call one of these Toll Free Capitol Hill switchboard #&#8217;s tomorrow:</p>
<p>1-877-851-6437<br />
1-800-828-0498<br />
1-866-340-9281<br />
1-866-338-1015</p>
<p>A nice person answers the phone. Tell the name of your rep. and state. You&#8217;ll be connected to the reps&#8217; aide who will take your comments.</p>
<p>Call ALL of your reps. And for good measure, call Marcy Kaptur, D. OH and thank her. She, along with many Republicans, is mincing no words in her hatred of this travesty against the American public. She needs your support to keep it up. If your rep. is a Republican who voted against the Fannie/Freddie Bailout last month (3/4 of the Repubs voted Nay) , THANK that person and encourage them to stick to their guns!</p>
<p>Call all of your reps., Dem. and Repub. alike. </p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, CEO of Goldman Saks from 1999-2006, has been lying to the public for 2 years about the true state of the economy. This is a monster that HE helped create while CEO of Goldman. Now, WE are being asked to cover Wall Streets&#8217; losses.</p>
<p>Also, the Dems are pushing for taxpayer provided &#8220;down payment assistance&#8221; to help the banks over this hump. Tell them NO WAY! It&#8217;s just more taxpayer losses into a falling RE market.</p>
<p>Let the price of homes fall to the level where people can afford to save their own downpayments! It worked in the US for decades and contributed to what used to be a wonderfully stable housing market, neighborhoods, communities.</p>
<p>Phone calls from the public are working! So please add your voice.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.FedUpUSA.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.FedUpUSA.org</a>. for more info if wished.</p>
<p>Democracy is working. Don&#8217;t Drop the Ball on This!</p>

			<p>As a real estate appraiser, I have been watching the mortgage meltdown with a very wary eye since 2004. I know, most people thought things were great back then, but I saw this coming. Instead of taking care of the mess, Congress and the President both allowed the downward slide to go unchecked. By late 2005, several states had the highest foreclosure rates in history, and still, everyone kept on pushing the lending and housing industry to perform more and more.</p>
<p>Obama, Biden, Dodd, and Frank are all guilty of not only ignoring solutions, but of contributing to the downward slide by actually deregulating Fannie and Freddie precisely at the time more regulation was needed. They should all be prosecuted for conflict of interest. I understand that the FBI and the Comptroler&#8217;s office are both investigating the Freddie-Fannie-Biden-Dodd-Obama-Frank Connection. It&#8217;s about time.</p>

			<p>I want all of you to understand one thing:<br />
IF THIS BAIL OUT FAILS TO GET THROUGH CONGRESS IN A TIMELY MANNER, THE NATIONAL AND MAYBE EVEN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY WILL COLLAPSE WITHIN 3-4 MONTHS!</p>
<p>Most of us have been shocked at the numbers. Please people, don&#8217;t allow the lying news media to do this to you.</p>
<p>The truth about this bail out is not what you are hearing on the news. First of all, most of the bail out is in LOAN GUARANTEES. That means no money actually changes hands. That part of the bail out does not cost us anything. The government is merely a cosigner. There is another part that is a LOAN. It will be paid back with interest. A third part is a buy out of assetts that will be liquidated to return money to the treasury. NET COST TO THE TAXPAYER= ZERO OR NEARLY ZERO! </p>
<p>So why do the bailout?</p>
<p>1. Banks failing always cost Taxpayers money and investors (depositors money) FDIC will have to pay depositors, so bailing it out with a loan is better than paying all those depositors with no return.</p>
<p>2. If all of that real estate comes onto the market at once, without hope for renegoiating the loans or salvaging the homes from foreclosure, the bottom will completely drop out of the residential real estate market nationwide. That means if you own a home, it will be worth less than it is worth right now.</p>
<p>3. If the bottom drops out of the real estate market, and the banks continue to tank, international monetary connections will lose too. That could start an international monetary crisis the likes of which the world has never seen.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll bet nobody on the news has stopped to explain that, have they? </p>
<p>This bail out is something right out of the handbook of FDR and Bill Clinton. It is a GOOD THING! The alternatives to doing it are horrible things!</p>
<p>Now that you know the truth, go and call all those numbers again and beg the Congress to do the deal. It will save you money in the long run.</p>

I was just reading online about that investigation!<br />
The FBI is looking into it, I find that fascinating!<br />
**********************************</p>
<p>It would be even more fascinating if they included members of Congress in their investigation.  watched some of the hearings today, and two things were clear:  1)  Congress does not have a clue regarding a solution; and 2) Congress is taking NO responsibility for creating this disaster in the first place.  It was Congress created and delivered the chemicals for this time bomb, and turned them over to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to mix together.  </p>
<p>And NOW I am reading where they added student loans, car loans and credit cards into the bailout mix over the weekend!  </p>
<p>If anyone notices the glaring disparities in beneficiaries here?  The lenders and Wall Street reap the benefits of the problems they profited on the last several years, while the American taxpayer is left out of the will completely.  Well, not completely &#8211; we get to pay dearly for the incompetence and breach of the public trust by Congress, and for the greed of the financial institutions involved.  And all the while, the smoke screen laid down in the ensuing havoc of the decline and recovery of the markets will allow out Congressional leaders to escape unscathed, to screw us another day.</p>

			<p>Along with the bail out comes a few strings! The treasury Secretary will have jurisdiction over every thing in the bail out until all the loans are repaid and all the guarantees are satisfied, and all the assetts are liquidated. </p>
<p>There may even be some penalties for the worst offenders, including forcing some of the executives to pay back severance pay and possibly their bonuses and part or all of their salaries. </p>

			<p>The reason Congress is dragging its feet on this is because they know it will help Obama! The reasoning goes like this: </p>
<p>As long as the crisis continues, Bush and the republicans (including John McCain) look bad. If the republicans look bad, people will vote for Obama as an alternative. If the bail out passes and works, that is an edge Precious does not gain&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

<p>Suze Orman changed her tune today. She&#8217;s learned a lot since yesterday (as have others) and is now advising people that we are headed for a giant sh^tstorm. ie. learn to make do with less because credit is going bye-bye. Days of layaway coming back. She actually said &#8220;we are going back to a cash (!) society&#8221;.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, it was easy for the media to present this as &#8220;If we do it, it will fix things, if we don&#8217;t do it, watch out&#8221;.</p>

			<p>This is a move to stabilize the economy until appropriate liquidation and refinance from private sources can be arranged. The market has no liquidity right now. That means there is no money to lend to refinance or purchase housing which is what is needed to stabilize the real estate market. If we add the liquidation of the vast number of houses in foreclosure to the problem, especially with no money available to finance them, we have a sinking market. Some of these houses may sell for less than 10% of the debt on them, forcing down the housing prices accordingly in the near vicinity. But if we are able to liquidate in a more orderly manner, without &#8216;fire sales&#8217; to clear the books, we can recoup more value and retain the value of the real estate that is not in crisis.</p>

<p>Florida- The McCain-Palin presidential campaign today announced that Hispanic supporters will gather at the Habana Cafe in Gulfport for an “Obamanomics” dinner tomorrow, September 24th, at 7:00 PM. In honor of the 94 times Senator Obama has voted for higher taxes, McCain-Palin supporters will dine on a meal costing $9.40. </p>
<p>Also, in honor of Senator Obama’s lack of leadership in the Illinois Senate — as evidenced by his 130 “present” votes and continued refusal to take a clear position on how to solve America’s current financial woes– McCain supporters will be able to purchase flan for $1.30.</p>

			<p>The main thing that I get from this is that there ARE strings attached. These companies will be closely audited by the treasury department. Fannie and Freddie are already being run by the Treasury until such time as they are in the black. This means treasury will decide on salary and bonuses, any policy changes, any liquidation of assetts, etc. This is the same as being put into conservatory. </p>
<p>The alternative to doing this bail out is to allow the total collapse of the international economy. This is the kind of things that led to the great depression and eventually to WWII when Germany decided it had been taken advantage of unfairly by other nations in Europe.</p>

			<p>This &#8216;bailout&#8217; is nuts. We need to take our medicine. why is it that no one is willing to tighten their belts and g owithout a few things to work to get our country back on track? In 1990 there was a book out that was very popular with politicians, economists, and academia. It&#8217;s main thesis was that we needed to immediately deflate our economy  to prevent collapse. To continue putting bandaids on the growth oriented philosophy was to commit long term economic suicide. They suggested we should have deflated during the 70&#8242;s. But no, not our greedy little country. If we just put bandaids on it and bury our heads in the sand long enough it will all just go away by itself.<br />
But now it&#8217;s time to pay the piper. We can either treat the cold today, or die from pneumonia tomorrow. but the choice (do we have one even) needs to be made NOW!</p>

<p>By Fall &#8217;06, the large Investment Banks were suffering huge losses and lying about it. No mention in the MSM.</p>
<p>Feb. &#8217;07: First  huge bank (HSBC) loses a hedge fund and has to fess up.</p>
<p>Spring &#8217;07: Bear Sterns is imploding. Bernanke &amp; Paulson still claiming, it&#8217;s confined to &#8220;subprime&#8221;. (By that time, in fact, Credit Suisse had released charts that showed the contagion was moving well into Alt-A loans and that Prime would be after that).</p>
<p>Summer &#8217;07: Bear Sterns GONE. American taxpayers give 30 billion $ bailout to Merril Lynch so they  can sweep up some of Bears assets.</p>
<p>Fall &#8217;07: B&amp;P continue with the &#8220;confined to subprime mem&#8221; to the American Public and insist there&#8217;s no problem. All the worldwide credit markets, however, KNOW there&#8217;s a huge problem, and know they are being lied to. Because of lack of transparency, they begin to mistrust each other and lending tightens.</p>
<p>Winter &#8217;08: B&amp;P start acknowledging the economy is slowing down, but insist it&#8217;s a blip and there will be &#8220;2nd half recovery&#8221;.</p>
<p>Spring &#8217;08: no signs of recovery, things worsening. Fannie and Freddie convulsing.</p>
<p>Summer &#8217;08: Paulson informs Congress that F/F are FINE , BUT! just in case, he&#8217;d like assurances that, should F/F run into trouble at some later date he&#8217;d like to have  a 200 billion line of credit. Congress aquiesces.</p>
<p>One month later! Pauson asks Congress to make good on their promise. 200 Billion F/F taxpayer funded bailout rushed thru in 3 days time.</p>
<p>One month later! P&amp;B claim they need 85 billion to bail AIG and that will fix everything.</p>
<p>One week later! Paulson asks for 800 billion bailout and that will fix everything.</p>
<p>It will not work. It is not nearly enough $$$. We do not have enough $$ to bail this mess. It is, to coin a phrase &#8220;Too Big to Bail&#8221;.</p>
<p>Time to stop these stupid bailouts. We cannot afford them and they&#8217;ll fix nothing!</p>
<p>Sorry for the spastic timeline, it&#8217;s just one look at one side of a multi-faceted problem.</p>
<p>Enough with the stupid bailouts that won&#8217;t fix a thing.</p>

<p>Maybe so, but my people aren&#8217;t from that far south and my dear mama (Joan, so you KNOW she was cool) and her dad spoke the same way. You never had to guess where you stood and the ways they said things were so to the point, you&#8217;d darn near pee yourself. But they were right! Anyway, every now and then I can hear one of them in what you say. Grandpa was a teacher from when he was 15 years old (Ohio didn&#8217;t require a degree in 1920) in a one room schoolhouse until he was 65. Maybe it&#8217;s a teacher thing too!</p>

<p>********************************</p>
<p>Your comment reminds me of one of my favorite poems and I thought I would share it with you, although I think you might already know this poem.</p>
<p>A Reason, a Season, or a Lifetime<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>There is a reason that a person comes into our life.  It is always sort of the same reason.  It is so that we may heal ourself and thus move closer to god.  It is for us to always love the other person.  Usually the person comes into our life and causes us great stress.   In order to love the person we need to make one step first and that is to forgive the person.</p>
<p>Now forgiveness is always to know that &#8220;The other person did not do what it is I thought they did&#8221; and because they did not do it,  there is no forgiveness necessary.  </p>
<p>Always and everytime when we truely forgive the other person we actually forgive and heal ourself.  For my sister and I are ONE.  But true forgiveness is NEVER that he did it but I forgive him for doing it.  True forgiveness is rare and it is always &#8220;She did not do what it is that I thought she did.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do I turn my great enemy into she who I love.  It is not so easy but the first step is recognition that she did not do what it is that I thought she did and then that opens to the second part which allows love to enter. </p>
<p>So our entire life is composed of opportunities to forgive and love.  Our entire life is full of people who come to us and seem to harm us and we see beyond that and forgive and love and thus heal ourself becuase my sister and I are ONE.  </p>
<p>This is the way that god gave us to heal ourself.  </p>
<p>We walk around with things inside ourself that need healing but we do not know what those things are and we do not know how to heal them.  However,  god gave us a simple trick to heal ourself.  The trick is that we are all ONE and we see ourself in our sister.  And by forgiving and loving our sister we come to forgive and love ourself.</p>
<p>The highest place for us to attain in our world is to love ourself.  And since we are ONE with everyone we can ONLY LOVE OURSELF BY LOVING EVERYONE.  IF THERE IS BUT ONE PERSON WE DO NOT LOVE THEN WE DO NOT LOVE OURSELF.</p>
<p>Judgement is always a form of judging the other person as guilty.   Therefore we must never judge another because we are always judging ourself.  Love never judges at all.  Love knows She never did what it is that I thought she did.  Obviously it helps to know that our thoughts which are not pure love are always wrong.  </p>
<p>So now you know the reason for life is to love yourself. </p>
<p>Love flows within yourself.</p>
<p>love is god</p>
<p>you are love.</p>
<p>you are made by god in his image and given the greatest gift from god which is the ability to love.</p>
<p>love is god </p>
<p>God made you as a god.   he is the creator god and we are the created one son of god.  but eternal god no less with all the power and glory of god.  so fear nothing for we are god.  it may take us a thousand lifetimes but when we come to love ourself we will KNOW that we are god.  </p>
<p>all the above is the original teaching of Jesus covered over and hidden by the churches of the world to protect their ego.  Jesus taught that organized religion is a contradiction of terms.  for true religion is a personal one and one relationship between each person and god talking to each other WITH NO ONE ELSE INVOLVED.  For the ONE TRUE GOD is inside of ourself and bringing in any form of external person place or thing only makes it a false idol.  so all organized religions since they are external must be false idols.  anyway enough or too much for now.</p>

			<p>This was in today&#8217;s Wall Street Journal:</p>
<p>Blame Fannie Mae and Congress<br />
For the Credit Mess<br />
By CHARLES W. CALOMIRIS and PETER J. WALLISON<br />
Many monumental errors and misjudgments contributed to the acute financial turmoil in which we now find ourselves. Nevertheless, the vast accumulation of toxic mortgage debt that poisoned the global financial system was driven by the aggressive buying of subprime and Alt-A mortgages, and mortgage-backed securities, by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The poor choices of these two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) &#8212; and their sponsors in Washington &#8212; are largely to blame for our current mess.</p>
<p>How did we get here? Let&#8217;s review: In order to curry congressional support after their accounting scandals in 2003 and 2004, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac committed to increased financing of &#8220;affordable housing.&#8221; They became the largest buyers of subprime and Alt-A mortgages between 2004 and 2007, with total GSE exposure eventually exceeding $1 trillion. In doing so, they stimulated the growth of the subpar mortgage market and substantially magnified the costs of its collapse.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that, as GSEs, Fannie and Freddie were viewed in the capital markets as government-backed buyers (a belief that has now been reduced to fact). Thus they were able to borrow as much as they wanted for the purpose of buying mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Their buying patterns and interests were followed closely in the markets. If Fannie and Freddie wanted subprime or Alt-A loans, the mortgage markets would produce them. By late 2004, Fannie and Freddie very much wanted subprime and Alt-A loans. Their accounting had just been revealed as fraudulent, and they were under pressure from Congress to demonstrate that they deserved their considerable privileges. Among other problems, economists at the Federal Reserve and Congressional Budget Office had begun to study them in detail, and found that &#8212; despite their subsidized borrowing rates &#8212; they did not significantly reduce mortgage interest rates. In the wake of Freddie&#8217;s 2003 accounting scandal, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan became a powerful opponent, and began to call for stricter regulation of the GSEs and limitations on the growth of their highly profitable, but risky, retained portfolios.</p>
<p>If they were not making mortgages cheaper and were creating risks for the taxpayers and the economy, what value were they providing? The answer was their affordable-housing mission. So it was that, beginning in 2004, their portfolios of subprime and Alt-A loans and securities began to grow. Subprime and Alt-A originations in the U.S. rose from less than 8% of all mortgages in 2003 to over 20% in 2006. During this period the quality of subprime loans also declined, going from fixed rate, long-term amortizing loans to loans with low down payments and low (but adjustable) initial rates, indicating that originators were scraping the bottom of the barrel to find product for buyers like the GSEs.</p>
<p>The strategy of presenting themselves to Congress as the champions of affordable housing appears to have worked. Fannie and Freddie retained the support of many in Congress, particularly Democrats, and they were allowed to continue unrestrained. Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass), for example, now the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, openly described the &#8220;arrangement&#8221; with the GSEs at a committee hearing on GSE reform in 2003: &#8220;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have played a very useful role in helping to make housing more affordable . . . a mission that this Congress has given them in return for some of the arrangements which are of some benefit to them to focus on affordable housing.&#8221; The hint to Fannie and Freddie was obvious: Concentrate on affordable housing and, despite your problems, your congressional support is secure.</p>
<p>In light of the collapse of Fannie and Freddie, both John McCain and Barack Obama now criticize the risk-tolerant regulatory regime that produced the current crisis. But Sen. McCain&#8217;s criticisms are at least credible, since he has been pointing to systemic risks in the mortgage market and trying to do something about them for years. In contrast, Sen. Obama&#8217;s conversion as a financial reformer marks a reversal from his actions in previous years, when he did nothing to disturb the status quo. The first head of Mr. Obama&#8217;s vice-presidential search committee, Jim Johnson, a former chairman of Fannie Mae, was the one who announced Fannie&#8217;s original affordable-housing program in 1991 &#8212; just as Congress was taking up the first GSE regulatory legislation.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Senate Banking Committee, then under Republican control, adopted a strong reform bill, introduced by Republican Sens. Elizabeth Dole, John Sununu and Chuck Hagel, and supported by then chairman Richard Shelby. The bill prohibited the GSEs from holding portfolios, and gave their regulator prudential authority (such as setting capital requirements) roughly equivalent to a bank regulator. In light of the current financial crisis, this bill was probably the most important piece of financial regulation before Congress in 2005 and 2006. All the Republicans on the Committee supported the bill, and all the Democrats voted against it. Mr. McCain endorsed the legislation in a speech on the Senate floor. Mr. Obama, like all other Democrats, remained silent.</p>
<p>Now the Democrats are blaming the financial crisis on &#8220;deregulation.&#8221; This is a canard. There has indeed been deregulation in our economy &#8212; in long-distance telephone rates, airline fares, securities brokerage and trucking, to name just a few &#8212; and this has produced much innovation and lower consumer prices. But the primary &#8220;deregulation&#8221; in the financial world in the last 30 years permitted banks to diversify their risks geographically and across different products, which is one of the things that has kept banks relatively stable in this storm.</p>
<p>As a result, U.S. commercial banks have been able to attract more than $100 billion of new capital in the past year to replace most of their subprime-related write-downs. Deregulation of branching restrictions and limitations on bank product offerings also made possible bank acquisition of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, saving billions in likely resolution costs for taxpayers.</p>
<p>If the Democrats had let the 2005 legislation come to a vote, the huge growth in the subprime and Alt-A loan portfolios of Fannie and Freddie could not have occurred, and the scale of the financial meltdown would have been substantially less. The same politicians who today decry the lack of intervention to stop excess risk taking in 2005-2006 were the ones who blocked the only legislative effort that could have stopped it.</p>
<p>Mr. Calomiris is a professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Mr. Wallison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was general counsel of the Treasury Department in the Reagan administration.</p>

			<p>Something has to be done to keep the bottom from falling out of the economy.  If there is no bailout, then business will close, job loss will be huge.  The rippling effect will be enormous.  I can weather it because my parents (depression era) taught me how, but I&#8217;m not confident in the baby boomer generation and how they will deal with something that major.  There are more of them than me.  Now the FBI is investigating AGI and Lehman just like they did with the Savings and Loans, Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac.  According to some experts in this area, it will take over two years for those investigations to come to actual indictments and for the bailouts/regulations to turn things around.  And of course, the Federal Highway Trust Fund is broke (no funds) because Bush borrowed from it.  What a mess?  Maybe Obama deserves this mess.  Let him fall on his face.  Hillary can come along after and pick him up in 2012.</p>

			<p>And the rumor is that the FBI investigation will come up with some direct ties to Congress.  Much of the AGI and Lehmen monies can be found in congressional contributions and there are not many of them who didn&#8217;t partake.  We know Dodd and Obama were recipients.  Hillary probably got some contributions as well.  It&#8217;s a mess in Washington D.C. and it just needs a complete overhaul.  They say that outsiders have a hard time when they first go to D.C. because of all the cliques.  Will maybe its time for that to change.  Voting for downticket dems who are more of the same won&#8217;t do the changing that we need.   Anyone who comes through the party line is doomed to fit right into the same mentality that got us into this mess in the first place.  And voter apathy hasn&#8217;t helped.  What makes it even worse is that those who follow the &#8220;chosen one&#8221; are as corrupted by the system as he is.</p>

			<p>With appropriate oversight and regulation, these institutions have worked well for the better part of 75 years! It was lack of oversight and regulation that caused Savings and Loan, and the lack of regulation, oversight, and common sense, paired with the infusion of political pandering that caused this.</p>
<p>But yes, for most of my career, some 33 years in the business, these institutions have worked well and done their job to the bennefit of the American Citizen. It has only been in the last 8 years that they were left to do as their corrupt leaders pleased. The Congress is just as guilty (both parties) as the executive branch. Neither executed enough oversight and regulation. </p>

<p>Agreed.  But will Pelosi and crew do proper oversight?  I don&#8217;t have much faith in the crew that didn&#8217;t do it the past two years, to do it in the next four years.

Let&#8217;s not forget also who his wife is&#8230;Andrea Mitchell.  The Greenspans love themselves some barry/barack.</p>

<p>The plan is good. That is where we must start.  Then, as political activists, we must insist on the proper execution of the plan! </p>
<p>McCain is more honorable than Obama. That is also a good starting place. The scuttlebut today is that Rommney is going to be placed in an economic czar&#8217;s position in a McCain presidency. I am not a big Mitt fan, but he is quite good on economic issues. If he were to be placed at the head of Treasury, he could do all the regulation if the bill passes as proposed by Paulson.</p>

			<p>The only way to cure the corruption is to cut off the money that funds it.  If the people (taxpayers) are not willing to sacrifice and make do without a few of their creature comforts, then the corruption will only continue.  We have no means of enforcing oversight. No means of guaranteeing it would even happen. We have to be firm and resist this bailout. If it passes, the fat cats will get a little fatter and we will suffer much, much more in the long run.

			<p>Ya know, this whole economy problem is built on the hot air of everyone owning the American dream at any cost. People bought into it, buy a home without fixed rates, in two years when the rates can change, hope your house is more valuable. Home are over valued by about 50%. That happened in a few short years. People in California that owned a little track home ended up with a million dollar price tag on a pile of crap. Some sold their house at a huge profit, either moved to some were else and bought a more expensive house or moved out of the state and bought somewhere else. People making as little money as I do, bought themselves a home. Lived the good life for two years and crash. Couldn&#8217;t afford to make the higher rate of loan when it increased, foreclosure, house is empty, all fixtures stolen and ransacked. People playing the stock market, dot bombs&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

Can you help me understand why using private consultants , and allowing one individual, the Treasury Secretary to Czar this move, is the appropriate way to go?  Can you also help me understand why those same consultants will not be some of the very same individuals who gamed this system in the first place?<br />

			<p>Henrietta: But John McCain, I thought, does not want to put this issue simply in the hands of a Czar kind of one person hands, i.e. Sec of Treasury.  And for all my love of Bill, it was under his administration that rules and laws among financial institutions were loosened and removed in some cases. Without oversight, and there was none by Congress, even with a yearly report by the quasi independent agency created in 1992 or 3, reporting every year to Congress on conditions of Fannie Mae and Mac, why should any of us believe something better will ensue under one man&#8230;.?<br />
I don&#8217;t. I believe MCain will take an approach that assures better oversight but I need to go check his position on the details of the bailout as of today &#8230;i.e.<br />

			<p>If you suspect that your pet does have a flea infestation examine the animal closely by separating the hair on the animals back or flank area.  You want to be able to view the skin of the animal as well as possible and it will always be easier to detect fleas on those pets that have a lighter skin tone.  During your search you might actually be able to see a flea scurrying by, but more likely you will see the evidence that the flea has left behind.  Flea dirt (or feces) will appear as small, black pebbles in the fur and on the skin.  To determine whether or not what you see is actually flea dirt, take some wet paper towel and wipe it over areas where the dirt is most prominent.  If the dirt on the wet paper towel has dissolved into red blood then you can bet that you are indeed dealing with a flea problem.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s get down to bathing your flea infested friend.  Use an herbal shampoo that contains a combination of any of pine cedar, bergamot, rosemary, lavender, eucalyptus, citronella, juniper or geranium.  Before you wet down your pet here&#8217;s a handy trick to ensure that you are successful in killing all of those nasty fleas.  Know going into this process that as soon as you wet the animal down, those fleas are going to run for higher and dryer ground; this means they will flea (no pun intended) to the head area.  You should never douse your pet&#8217;s head with water and certainly not soap, so in order to prevent the fleas from escaping make sure that you first pour a thick layer of the shampoo all around the head and neck area; as close to the top of the head and underneath the chin area as you can get.  Pour small amounts of water with your hand onto the soapy area and spend some time building up a thick, soapy barrier that will kill the fleas that attempt to pass through it.  Proceed by wetting down and lathering up the rest of the animal&#8217;s body while frequently returning to massage and re-lather the neck area.  Fleas are very difficult to kill and it is better for your pet if you can handle the problem with one good bath rather than several of them, so be sure to leave the shampoo on for at least 15 minutes or more while continuing to massage the soap deep into the animal&#8217;s fur.  Rinse the animal thoroughly and dry it off well, especially during cold weather.</p>
<p>If you are also dealing with a house infestation of fleas, here&#8217;s a great way to get rid of the problem.  Mix together 1 1/2 pounds of diatomaceous earth, 1 1/2 pounds of natural borax and 1 cup of salt. (Don&#8217;t use the earth and borax that you can purchase at a pool store, rather use the products that you can get from your local garden store.)  The diatomaceous earth works because it contains very tiny particles that have sharp spines, which puncture the exoskeleton of the flea, killing it.  The borax and salt work by absorbing the moisture of the flea and make all of those cracks and small areas that they might find to live in your home much more undesirable.  You can use the mixture by sprinkling it throughout your home onto carpets and into those harder to reach areas.  Allow the mixture to sit for a couple of days and then vacuum it up.  Although these powders are not poisonous it&#8217;s never a good idea for you or your pet to breathe it continually for days so if it&#8217;s possible to go elsewhere while it sits then that&#8217;s definitely an option you should use.  Alternatively, if you prefer not to douse the house with the mixture, you can always pour it into your vacuum cleaner bag and vacuum everything thoroughly so that any of the sucked up fleas will die inside the bag.  Keep in mind that this solution will not kill the un-hatched flea eggs and therefore the process may need to be repeated several times depending on the severity of your problem.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Henerietta,<br />
the only way you will be able to save the kitten is to take it to the vet.  ours was a little older when we found him he was full of fleas. iigot some of that kitten milk at Walmart and fed him. The next day we took him to the vet and the vet said he would probably die cuz the fleas had completely dehydrated him. He gave the kitten a large syringe of sugar water like an IV and only charged us half the bill because he didn&#8217;t expect him to live. The next day our now 5 year old cat was full of vim and vigor. We eventually got rid of the fleas . It took a couple of days. We love him very much.</p>

			<p>It is my understanding that it is probably that there will be many overseers in the treasury department. </p>
<p>This is the tweaking that Congress needs to do. There needs to be some guidelines as to the responsibility of the treasury department. As I understand it, the treasury department, headed by the treasury secretary, is the entity being made responsible for overseeing and managing the bail out. That is much more than just one person. The Treasury has many sub departments. They even include the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, tobbacco and firearms!</p>

<p>How to remove fleas on a very young kitten</p>
<p>The safest way to treat a kitten under 6 weeks of age for fleas is to bathe him using warm water and Dawn dishwashing detergent and then to manually pick off remaining fleas. Dawn dishwashing soap is very effective and it kills fleas quickly. Many breeders bathe their cats in Dawn.</p>

			<p>#583Henrietta; I concur with you here. My concerns rest in the Czar concept and the fact that the Treasury Sec will not be here in January!  My concerns are with consultants who themselves may very well have been part of the play for this debacle in the first place. My concerns are for placing more financial mess in this bailout ..student loans, credit cards,&#8230;My concerns are with the details, not the concept of bailout. We can not let all the cards fall, but the details will determine the nature and results of the effort. And I agree with McCain that one person should not have total control of this thing.</p>

<p>The first link is the introduction by Palin and the other three are the McCain speech. I know everyone says he&#8217;s always against regulation, but he&#8217;s smart too. John McCain co-sponsored the S. 190 [109th]: Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 and Democrats and some Republicans shot it down! That Bill predicted everything happening now. It called for oversight of Freddie Mac and Fannie May! There is plenty of blame to go around both Parties, but so far McCain and the Clintons are offering solutions while Obama is waiting to decide who to copy from. He can&#8217;t do that as President! Oh well, I hope the speech helps you in your decision.  : )</p>

<p>    I would like to walk away and let the people who made the mess suffer. The problem is, we are all going to suffer if we let this thing go too far. If you own a house, have an insurance policy (health, car, or life), a pension fund or a 401K, you are affected, whether you participated directly in the creation of the mess or not. That is the reality. If we don’t do something, it will take down the value of all of our assetts, perhaps wipe them completely out.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
This is part of the problem in my opinion. You are worried about the value of your assets, and don&#8217;t want to lose anything. Is it right for everyone to have what they bought on credit and have everyone else pay more taxes for all those people that want to keep their assets? I have no assets, I rent an apartment, I have no stock&#8230;I one my used car. I work full time yet I am already in my early sixties. Should someone that didn&#8217;t buy into the hype pay more taxes so others with a home and assets can keep what they have in loans? If you own something free and clear, it&#8217;s yours. You can&#8217;t have it taken away, but if you bought a home and have loans&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;you are in the mess.</p>

			<p>Whether Democrat or Republican, you should get a kick out of this!</p>
<p>A little boy goes to his dad and asks, &#8216;What is Politics?&#8217;</p>
<p>Dad says, &#8216;Well son, let me try to explain it this way:</p>
<p>I am the head of the family, so call me The President.</p>
<p>Your mother is the administrator of the money, so we call her the<br />
Government.</p>
<p>We are here to take care of your needs, so we will call you the People.</p>
<p>The nanny, we will consider her the<br />
Working Class.</p>
<p>And your baby brother, we will call him the Future.</p>
<p>Now think about that and see if it makes sense.</p>
<p>So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said.</p>
<p>Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check<br />
on him.</p>
<p>He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper.</p>
<p>So the little boy goes to his parents&#8217; room and finds his mother asleep.<br />
Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny&#8217;s room Finding the door<br />
locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny.<br />
He gives up and goes back to bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, the little boy says to his father, &#8216;Dad, I think I<br />
understand the concept of politics now.&#8217;</p>
<p>The father says, &#8216;Good, son, tell me in your own words what you think<br />
politics is all about.&#8217;</p>
<p>The little boy replies, &#8216;The President is screwing the Working Class while<br />
the Government is sound asleep.<br />
The People are being ignored and the Future is in deep shit.</p>

<p>You are correct. John McCain and Hillary Clinton both tried to get reform going long before anyone else in Congress or in the Bush Administration even took notice that there was a problem. Most of the current INNER Circle democrats (Pelosi, Reid, Kennedy, etc) actually blocked their efforts. </p>
<p>This gives me hope that John McCain will follow through if and when he is the president. Obama was one of the road blocks, so how exactly, can he fix something he has helped create?</p>

			<p>Henrietta, I found one of my cats abandoned at approx. 4 weeks old. He had never eaten solid food as he had not been weaned. He was covered in fleas in the manner you describe. How I handled it comes with a &#8220;caution label&#8221;. I bathed him, blew his coat dry on a low/warm setting on the hair dryer and gave him one drop of Advantage between the shoulder blades. Advantage should not be used on a kitten that small. But I did, and it worked. He is now on the verge of turning 8 years old, healthy and happy.</p>

I know everyone in Washington bears some blame, but I don&#8217;t know when Obama plans to start taking action. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important now. He actually criticized McCain for offering a solution! The other problem with Obama is his policies change depending on he steals ideas from, and changes people to steal from when his audience changes so I have no idea what to expect him to really do about anything. I know all politicians pander to blocks they need but McCain has a record and history we can consult and Obama has a business card. I dunno.</p>

<p>So you don&#8217;t think you are affected because you rent? Think again. Someone probably has a mortgage on your rental property. That property has value. If the bottom drops out of the real estate market, and the property owner finds himself in a negative equity situation, he may be forced to default. You would be out of a home. I also own my car free and clear. How would you like to have a car that you paid maybe $5,000 for last week, be worth $500 next week? </p>
<p>Do you have money in the bank? That would deflate too. How would you like to have to pay $1000 for a week&#8217;s worth of groceries because all of the nation&#8217;s money has been devalued to 10% of its current worth?</p>
<p>Perhaps you owned your own home, paying maybe, $100,000 for it, your life savings. Then the crash hits, and it is devalued to $10,000? You just lost your life savings. Perhaps you bought that house 10 years ago at $100,000 and have been paying on it the whole time. Now the house is worth $10,000 but you still owe $40,000 on it! </p>
<p>These are the things that happen when an economy collapses.</p>
<p>The other points I am making are:</p>
<p>The bail out will cost a net Zero or nearly a net Zero if the plan is properly executed. We are mostly cosigning loans/guaranteeing loans, and liquidating properties that we will buy to give the market some liquidity. That money will come back into the treasury eventually.</p>

<p>Yes the whole pot of crap in Washington deserves some blame. Maybe some of the better ones, Hillary, McCain, and others, should have tried harder. Maybe they did try harder, but could not win the fight. </p>
<p>Obama is certainly not a trustworthy individual. He will co-opt any good idea or any idea that serves his needs to co-opt at the moment. Underneath it all, he is either pandering for pandering sake, or up to no good in a self serving way. We could never trust him.</p>
<p>McCain, on the other hand, is usually more trustworthy and at least tries to follow through. Even if I disagree with him on many things, he is usually very candid and reliable in what he says and does. That is much better than anything I have seen out of Obama.</p>

McCain has always been friends with Senator Clinton and he&#8217;s always worked with Democrats so I think he will. Joe Biden even said once he would be honored to run with John McCain and I know he was on John Kerry&#8217;s short list in 2004. We also know Lieberman was someone McCain wanted to run with this time, but had to make a choice that would get Republicans to vote for him. I remember in the primary people like Ann Coulter said if McCain was the nominee she would vote for Hilary b/c she&#8217;s more conservative! lol I got way off subject in this rant,sorry. It&#8217;s late!  : )  The point is I think he and Clinton tried to warn us, I wish other politicians and the media would have listened!</p>

			<p>Thank you Lauriepuma for the kitty advice. I am worried about going to bed, as I am afraid she might not make it. I went out a little while ago and fed her some more milk. I will see what I can accomplish tomorrow. </p>
<p>I spent a good deal of time at the vet today. I have a visiting Boxer girl that I had bred AI at the vet today. My young studd boy wouldn&#8217;t do the deed, so we extracted sperm and insiminated. This was at a fertility vet, not my regular guy. </p>
<p>If this little girl makes it through the night, I will try to find out how to save her tomorrow.</p>

Interesting article. My mother is always saying he&#8217;s been groomed for this job by terrorists in another Country. I usually ignore it b/c I&#8217;m adopted and she&#8217;s 70 years old.

			<p>Henrietta, oy! My second cat is in the hospital right now. Very sick with what we do not know. Also very, very expensive. </p>
<p>You may not know this, but milk is not good for cats or kittens, contrary to the lore. My vet recommended baby food for the newborns &#8211; like the strained chicken with a little rice cereal. Or, you could do what I did, which also comes with a caution label &#8211; canned cat food, mashed into a puree&#8217; with a little warm water. I am sure animal folks are reading this and cringing that I am a terrible pet parent. But honestly, it worked better than babyfood. LOL.</p>

			<p>We will survive. My husband lost a job in January of 2001. He had been on that job for 17 years, and had worked up to department head. He took a 20% pay cut and went to work for a sister company. It went belly up after less than 18 months. He went to work for another company for about 15% less than the second job he lost. It also went belly up to a plant closing. </p>
<p>He now makes about 60% of what he once made, and has fewer bennefits. All of this happened when we had one daughter in College and then the other graduated and also went on to college. I thought we would not survive both girls being in school at the same time. </p>
<p>We got down to two cars among the 4 of us. Hubby works third shift, so the two of us shared his pick up truck. One daugher lived in the dorm (thank goodness for financial aid) and the other drove my car. The oldest daughter has now graduated with a nursing degree, and the youngest is a senior at Cal State Northridge. We live in Indiana, but Beth earned a place as an exchange student this year. </p>
<p>We now have three cars between us!</p>

I think owning a gun doesn&#8217;t make you a killer, it makes you a smart American.</p>
<p>I think being a minority does not make you noble or victimized, and does not entitle you to anything. Get over it!                      </p>
<p>I believe that if you are selling me a Big Mac, do it in English.  I believe everyone has a right to pray to his or her God when and where they want to.</p>

<p>We like it the way it is!   </p>
<p>If you were born here and don&#8217;t like it you are free to move to any Socialist country that will have you.   I want to know which church is it, exactly, where the Reverend Jesse Jackson preaches, where he gets his money, and why he is always part of the problem and not the solution.

			<p>My neighbor found a very small kitten crying and abandoned out behind another neighbor&#8217;s garage. I brought it in and am trying to care for it. It is obviously very young and seems to be dehydrated. It also has a multitude of fleas. It is solid white, and the fleas are very visible. </p>
<p>I gave it some diluted 2% milk, and tried to pick the fleas off of it with a piece of tape. It didn&#8217;t work. The little one is now resting and has a full tummy. She seems to be ok for the moment.</p>

aww poor baby. I love cats. My ex gf had four, and I loved them more than anything. That&#8217;s also when I found the four kittens I had to find homes for. I had owned one cat before that, a Devonshire Rex which is hairless and I lived with someone else before that had a Persian(very hairy). Anyway, I was fine around those, but when I lived with her I found out I have severe allergies to cats! My eyes would swell up and I would get so itchy! I have to take Zyrtec to be around any cats now. It&#8217;s awful. I still love them though!</p>

			<p>Did anyone notice Obama being his usual Obama self, stealing ideas from his competitors and then saying that they were his ideas?</p>
<p>John McCain came out with his plan for dealing with the Wall Street financial debacle and shortly afterward, Obama came out with the same plan.  This is just too funny that people have not noticed that this has gone on since the early days between Obama and Hillary.  He would wait for her to come out with a plan and then reword it as his plan.  He would flip flop and then say that it is what &#8220;he had always said and people were not paying attention if they didn&#8217;t know that&#8221;.  Yeah. </p>
<p>Now he does that with McCain over and over, and the media still acts like they have not noticed this??  What is up with these people.  Are they not concerned that when there is no Hillary Clinton to come up with a plan, when there is no more John McCain to come up with a plan, then Obama will have no plans because he no longer will have anyone to figure out plans that he can steal? </p>
<p>This behavior also goes back to Obama&#8217;s behavior while in Chicago.  He didn&#8217;t write legislative bills.  Other legislature did the work, and then Obama&#8217;s  fairy godfather took those bills written by others, put Obama&#8217;s name on the top, allowed Obama to take the floor to present the bills, and Boom, Obama had legislation without doing a lick of work. </p>
<p>How stupid are the media if I can figure this out, but the professionals can&#8217;t see it?  Either they are blind, or stupid or chose to ignore the obvious in favor of denial that the candidate they want is a Trojan Horse whom they wish to push through for ideals that have no basis in the reality of government.  Or they have a money backed interest in seeing him win. </p>
<p>Following the money.  Has anyone ever figured out why Obama gets so much more money than any candidate ever?  My guess is that they expect him to keep doing what he did in Chicago, bring in money.  That is the Obama gift that just keeps giving.  Annenberg Project, 110 Million, Woods Foundation, more millions, Election funds, 66 million just in August.  Where does the money go?  Where does it come from?  It is not $5 and $10  donations.    Do those big ticket donors expect payback?  You know they do.  Will he pay them back?  Yeah , because he has no plan.  He won&#8217;t have anyone to steal a plan from anymore if elected President, so he will get his plans from those who bought his way into the White House.</p>

Don&#8217;t even get me started on that! That&#8217;s all he does. He never goes first b/c he has to wait to copy from his opponent. I screamed about it all through the primaries and now! The media kept saying he and Hillary were so close on policy. That&#8217;s because she always went first! McCain has the best energy plan and I kept trying to get him to give a &#8220;man to the moon&#8221; type speech before Obama did. What do you know, he gives the speech and even quoted sending man to the moon. I wonder if he&#8217;s stealing my emails,lol! He even said he was for limited offshore drilling too and everything else was the rest of McCain&#8217;s plan except the windfall profit tax and Obama is against nuclear energy. Well, who knows this week he might be for it! : )</p>

			<p>You know I was on the McCain blog earlier and an Obamabot got on there. First he was mad at the Democrats for McCain and told them they had sold out voting for an ultra-conservative Republican neocon. Then 20 minutes later more conservatives were on the blog and he told them they were fools being had. That John McCain was the same liberal he always was and he would say f- you to them after he won. So, I told the guy, &#8220;I know you&#8217;ve been listening to &#8216;have it both ways&#8217; Obama too long and it&#8217;s obviously rubbed off, but please pick one attack and stick to it.

			<p>Hi Everybody, </p>
<p>I’m against the $85,000,000,000.00 bailout of AIG.</p>
<p>  Instead, I’m in favor of giving $85,000,000,000 to America in a We Deserve It Dividend.</p>
<p>To make the math simple, let’s assume there are 200,000,000 bona fided U.S. Citizens 18+. </p>
<p>Our population is about 301,000,000 +/- counting every man, woman and child. So 200,000,000<br />
might be a fair stab at adults 18 and up..</p>
<p>  So divide 200 million adults 18+  into $85 billion that equals $425,000.00.</p>
<p>  My plan is to give $425,000 to every person 18+ as a We Deserve It Dividend.</p>
<p>  Of course, it would NOT be tax free.  So let’s assume a tax rate of 30%.</p>
<p>  Every individual 18+ has to pay $127,500.00 in taxes.  That sends $25,500,000,000 right back to Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>  But it means that every adult 18+ has $297,500.00 in their pocket.  A husband and wife has $595,000.00.</p>
<p>What would you do with $297,500.00 to $595,000.00 in your family?</p>
<p>Pay off your mortgage – housing crisis solved.</p>
<p>Repay college loans – what a great boost to new grads</p>
<p>Put away money for college – it’ll be there</p>
<p>Save in a bank – create money to loan to entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Buy a new car – create jobs</p>
<p>Invest in the market – capital drives growth</p>
<p>Pay for your parent’s medical insurance – health care improves</p>
<p>Enable Deadbeat Dads to come clean – or else</p>
<p>Remember this is for every adult U S Citizen 18+  including the folks who lost their jobs<br />
at Lehman Brothers and every other company that is cutting back.<br />
And of course, for those serving in our Armed Forces.</p>
<p>If we’re going to re-distribute wealth let’s really do it&#8230;instead of trickling out a puny $1000.00<br />
( “vote buy” ) economic incentive that is being proposed by one of our candidates for President.</p>
<p>  If we’re going to do an $85 billion bailout, let’s bail out every adult U S Citizen 18+!</p>
<p>As for AIG – liquidate it. </p>
<p>Sell off its parts. </p>
<p>Let American General go back to being American General.  Sell off the real estate. </p>
<p>  Let the private sector bargain hunters cut it up and clean it up. </p>
<p>Here’s my rationale. We deserve it and AIG   doesn’t.</p>
<p>Sure it’s a crazy idea that can “never work.”</p>
<p>But can you imagine the Coast-To-Coast Block Party! </p>
<p>How do you spell Economic Boom?</p>
<p>I trust my fellow adult Americans to know how to use the $85 Billion </p>
<p>We Deserve It Dividend more than they do, the geniuses at AIG or in Washington DC.</p>
<p>  And remember, The Family plan only really costs $59.5 Billion because $25.5 Billion is returned<br />
instantly in taxes to Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>Ahhh&#8230;I feel so much better getting that off my chest.</p>

a laugh or a tear or a very sobering thought on how to best use<br />

Thanks for the article. I checked it out, but I already knew those things weren&#8217;t true. I researched all of McCain&#8217;s short list options months before he chose and I found her to be his best choice. I knew he wanted Lieberman, but he already had trouble getting Republicans to vote for him. I liked her maverick streak and the fact that she was so real. I&#8217;m an Independent swing voter, but she is a little conservative for me. However, this is the bipartisan year and McCain is so moderate he&#8217;s like an Independent so it was cool with me. I wrote to him over and over saying I thought she would be his best choice. I knew about trooper-gate and all that so I didn&#8217;t know if he&#8217;d pick her, but I saw it for what it was from the beginning&#8211;NOTHING! I found it interesting they started that investigation when she was mentioned on his short list on tv a few times! I think she&#8217;s fabulous and I was happy when I turned on the tv and saw McCain went the person I had picked. I actually predicted both VP picks! I picked Biden before the media and Palin which the media never predicted. haha Those people are usually so wrong. Maybe that means McCain will actually win, but I can&#8217;t call that one.</p>

I like the screenname. It sounds like one of the names from the Sarah Palin baby name generator! It&#8217;s a blogspot where you put in your name and it tells you what your name would&#8217;ve been had Sarah Palin been your mother. Mine was Halter Grasshopper Palin! lol  : ) It&#8217;s silly, a little mean with some names, but good for a laugh!</p>

			<p>OBAMA AUTHOR ANDY MARTIN SAYS SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN MUST SAY &#8220;NO&#8221; TO THE WALL STREET BAILOUT</p>
<p>MARTIN SAYS MCCAIN SHOULD BREAK WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND ANNOUNCE &#8220;HE WORKS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT THE BANKERS, NOT THE BROKERS AND NOT THE FALLEN, FAILED CONFIDENCE MEN ON WALL STREET&#8221;</p>
<p>THE WOMAN&#8217;S ANGLE TO SAVING MCCAIN AND COUNTERATTACKING WALL STREET: ANDY MARTIN SAYS &#8220;KRAWCHECK FRONT AND CENTER!&#8221;</p>
<p>ANDY TAKES COMMAND AND LAYS OUT MCCAIN&#8217;S ROAD TO VICTORY</p>
<p>(NEW YORK)(September 24, 2008)  During the summer I told a number of groups that the only way Senator John McCain could win was to pick a woman for vice president. McCain was listening to me. He chose Sister Sarah and, until last week, he was on track to win. Until the phony Wall Street crisis erupted, that is.</p>
<p>A new Washington Post poll now shows Barack Obama opening up a decisive lead based on the amazing belief that Obama is more competent to manage the economy. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092303667.html?hpid=topnews" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092303667.html?hpid=topnews</a> </p>
<p>Obama, who has never managed anything without &#8220;mad bomber&#8221; William Ayers at his side, is not even competent to impose his own socialist worldview on the American economy. If the economy is bad now, it will be much worse under an Obama maladministration.</p>
<p>But how does McCain counteract the pro-Obama media hysteria over the economy?</p>
<p>He must speak clearly and simply and directly: he must announce in no uncertain terms his total opposition to the Wall Street bailout.</p>
<p>First, over the past year I have repeatedly pointed out that the current financial crisis is a &#8220;manufactured&#8221; crisis. The urgency was created by maladroit steps to rein in sub-prime mortgages when they posed no threat to the overall economy. One bad step led to another. We have rather clumsily managed to topple our own financial dominoes. The mess is Wall Street&#8217;s fault, not George Bush&#8217;s responsibility.</p>
<p>Second, a &#8220;crisis&#8221; of &#8220;faith&#8221; or &#8220;confidence&#8221; is by definition a false crisis. Faith and confidence are tropes for escapism and exaggeration or even manipulation. Omaha investor Warren Buffet, who is a legendary bottom fisher on Wall Street, is investing $5 billion in Goldman Sachs. Is he investing to receive the sub-par return that many have predicted Goldman will earn now that the firm has become a federally regulated bank holding company? Doubtful. Buffet knows that panics by definition lead to excesses, and excesses lead to opportunities.</p>
<p>The liquidation of Lehman Brothers is being handled on an orderly basis. Buyers are there to invest in the firm.</p>
<p>Third, McCain and his staff have to realize and admit that Obama has made some cautious but sensible statements. Obama opposes golden parachutes, supports financial incentives to small taxpayers as part of any bailout, and supports extensive bipartisan oversight instead of the blank check requested by the treasury secretary. Obama is playing classic ball control now that our national misfortune has rebounded to his political advantage.</p>
<p>Fourth, although McCain has made one TV commercial linking Obama to Frank Raines, the former Fannie Mae head, this is not a time for token spots to be used as talking points by the cable TV bobbleheads. McCain has to relentlessly hammer the fact that Obama has been in bed with the very people that orchestrated the financial collapse and who were the captains of greed on Wall Street. Ad after ad after ad. McCain has to base his entire campaign on exposing the perfidiousness and conflicts between Obama&#8217;s professed economic policies and the political realities of his fund-raising operation.</p>
<p>The timing of this &#8220;crisis&#8221; of &#8220;faith&#8221; and &#8220;confidence&#8221; is almost enough to make you wonder if Obama&#8217;s supporters on Wall Street manufactured the meltdown on the eve of the election to help elect their man. Why a crisis now? </p>
<p>McCain needs to attack Obama on the cash Obama received from Wall Streeters and Fannie Mae. McCain has made thrusts in this direction, but from now on he has to focus his entire campaign on exposing Obama as the man who was Wall Street&#8217;s favorite before the &#8220;collapse,&#8221; and is still the man Wall Street wants to win. Why has Wall Street been so consistently behind Obama? Why indeed?</p>
<p>Next, McCain must play the female card. And play it to win. Sallie Krawcheck was just pushed out at Citigroup (&#8220;The Citi never sleeps&#8221;) because she favored more protection for customers and less protection for bankers and brokers. Make her a heroine. Make her a parable for the greed and irredentist arrogance on Wall Street. &#8220;They still haven&#8217;t learned their lesson,&#8221; McCain should bellow at Wall Street and Broadway. &#8220;They dumped Krawcheck because she wanted to protect the public. And they want us to bail them out? No way!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tell people that &#8220;one courageous woman is worth a Wall Street of Gordon Gekkos.&#8221; Play the sex card. Play it hard. The women will love it. Krawchek was the most prominent woman left on Wall Street, and she was unceremoniously dumped because she favored protecting investors. These banker bastards still want to screw the public. They screwed Krawcheck. And we want the American people to bail them out? Remember Krawchek and Just Say No. </p>
<p>If you think the Palin card worked, the Krawcheck card will dynamite Obama the same way. Maybe more so. The last thing Obama &amp; Company are expecting from you-given your unsteady responses over the past week&#8211;is a bold counterattack with a woman at the fore. Krawchek front and center. Attack. The brave woman against the greedy men. I love it. </p>
<p>Just listen to Andy, and we&#8217;ll win this one for the Gipper. We military guys have to stick together. No one ever won a battle with half measures; no one ever won an election on defense. Krawchek front and center. Attack.</p>
<p>Finally, McCain has to reduce the &#8220;crisis&#8221; issue to a sound bite: &#8220;Just say no to the Wall Street bailout.&#8221; This is not a time for subtlety or ambiguity or professorial rumination. This is a time for clarity.</p>
<p>I was trained as an economist at the University of Illinois. One thing economists do when faced with unattractive options is to balance which choice will impose the least burden on the economy (or taxpayers, or whomever is the focus of concern). You look at the risks on each side, and try to see which way the scale tips. In my opinion, taking more risks with Wall Street is less risky than giving Wall Street a blank check to subsidize past excesses. The fact that Buffet is buying $5 billion of Goldman stock and there were plenty of buyers for Lehman&#8217;s assets shows there is money on Wall Street to bail out Wall Street. Taxpayers not needed.</p>
<p>Clearly, the federal government faces unattractive options. But the current bailout proposal favors the rich and disadvantages working families. Bankers and brokers would be rewarded, without significant punishment for their atrocious greed; working people who are struggling would get virtually nothing. Obama sees this opening, which is why he is asking that relief for families in distress be part of any package. But, as usual, Obama is afraid to be bold. Basketball player that he is, Obama feels he is in the lead and he should go into a &#8220;stall&#8221; and protect that lead.</p>
<p>The only way to beat the stall in basketball is to steal the ball. It is not enough for McCain to match Obama with incremental improvements in the proposed bailout bill (more oversight, no golden parachutes, more this, more that, more technicalities and legislative minutiae). </p>
<p>McCain needs to be bold and decisive and break with the Bush administration. McCain must turn his biggest liability into his greatest opportunity.</p>
<p>McCain needs to say that we must not tax ordinary Americans to preserve extreme wealth and privilege for a handful of top executives and financial operators. &#8220;Wall Street should suffer so that Main Street can survive,&#8221; McCain can state. &#8220;Main Street should not suffer so Wall Street can survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, it is essential to realize that the protective steps that were taken in the past, starting with last year&#8217;s overreaction to the sub-prime situation, and culminating in this year&#8217;s Bear Stearns takeover, failed. Why should we believe Treasury Secretary Paulsen now, when he has been consistently wrong in the past? Merely throwing bailout billions at Goldman Sachs&#8217; favored clients (Treasury Secretary Paulsen is a former Goldman chief) will not end the crisis or restore confidence. Pain will be suffered. </p>
<p>The question is whether we inflict pain on the privileged or on the powerless. McCain must say that if someone has to endure pain, it should be the privileged, not the powerless. Warren Buffet has billions more to invest where his opening $5 billion came from. Let him take the risk, not the little people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I speak for the American people,&#8221; McCain should say, &#8220;Not Wall Street, not brokers, not bankers, and certainly not the malefactors of great wealth who have been exposed as confidence men without confidence in their own machinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only if McCain takes command can he win. If he goes half way and meets Obama half way, McCain cannot overcome the natural advantage that flows not from Obama&#8217;s assets but rather from McCain&#8217; s liabilities as the representative of a party that is unfairly blamed for the mess on Wall Street. McCain has to make clear that the Wall Street scandals were a bipartisan whorehouse, and that Obama was in skivvies when the roof collapsed. Obama and Fannie Mae and Frank Raines were in bed together when no one was watching. Now the whole world is watching. </p>
<p>McCain must expose the truth and not be intimidated by the media spin machine that is anti-American and anti-Republican. </p>
<p>Senator McCain, take command. Just say no to the Wall Street bailout: &#8220;Main Street should not suffer to bail out Wall Street. The powerless should not have to pay higher taxes to subsidize the excesses and failures of the privileged class. I work for the American family, not billionaires and brokers. If Wall Street is good enough and safe enough for Warren Buffet, Wall Street does not need the nickels and dimes of working Americans. We should ban executive dining rooms and limousines for any bailout firm and watch how fast they find their own cash. Let the people who made this mess pay to clean up their failures. And remember what they did to Sallie Krawcheck.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the only way you can win. Do it. The American people will stand with you. They won&#8217;t desert you if you don&#8217;t desert them. Just tell Wall Street: Drop Dead.</p>

Thanks for the poll updates.<br />
Even if BO is up the polls by +15 I am not going to panic. Gore and Kerry were both ahead and they lost.<br />
I am hoping the same pattern repeats itself this year.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you racist, bitter old and uneducated &#8211; you may vote for Obama now. We’ll even stop calling you racist &#8211; at least on Election Day!&#8221;</p>

<p>I read the poll information from the WP, and I don&#8217;t believe for a minute that Americans believe BO is more qualified to turn the ecomony around.  If you noticed they polled a sample of African Americans.  Why didn&#8217;t they poll a sample of Clinton Democrat too?</p>

			<p>BAILOUT</p>
<p>There are times when government intervention can make things better. But that is no guarantee that it won&#8217;t make things worse. As they say, &#8220;the devil is in the details&#8221;&#8211; and we don&#8217;t know the details yet. </p>
<p>Probably most members of Congress don&#8217;t know the details yet&#8211; and many may still not know the details when the time comes for them to vote on this bailout. </p>

			<p>Correcting my typo&#8230;. economy</p>
<p>BO and the DP are unworthy to lead this country.  They are using the economic crisis as leverage in this election.  What is more galling is DP leaders have been at the forefront of the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Country Wide debacle.  </p>
<p>Barney Frank (D) has been quoted from 2003, 2004 and so on stating that Fannie Mae was doing ok and Wall Street could handle the storm.  I&#8217;m not sure what side I agree with about the bailout.  However, I&#8217;m discounting what the Dems are saying because they have been a big cause of this.</p>
<p>Oil Drilling &#8211; the DP&#8217;s bill is a joke.  They want us to drill in an area where no oil exists.  Next, it is the Federal government and not the states that would gain the most profits.  Why would any state agree to those financial terms?  Finally, the other states bordering have to agree to the oil drilling.  I have been a Democrat forever, I am so ashamed of them.  BO, the Dems, and the MSM are acting like a third world dictatorship.</p>
<p>AFTER ALL THE CAUCUS FRAUD AND BUYING  SUPERDELEGATE VOTES TO GAIN THE NOMINATION, WHY WOULD WE TRUST BO TO HANDLE OUR ECONOMY?</p>

			<p>this was in an email i received this am. Has anyone else gotten anything like it&#8230;? It&#8217;s about obama&#8217;s internet campaigne funding..Im not posting the entire thing, but this is disturbing<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
While the security people were not able to track most of the<br />
sources due to firewalls and other blocking devices put on these<br />
contributions they were able to collate the number of<br />
contributions that were coming in seemingly from individuals but<br />
the funds were from only a few credit card accounts and bank<br />
electronic funds transfers.  The internet service providers (ISP)<br />
they were able to trace were from  Saudi Arabia ,  Iran , and<br />
other Middle Eastern countries. One of the banks used for fund<br />
transfers was also located in  Saudi Arabia .</p>
<p>Another concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese<br />
ISP with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.</p>
<p>        It became clear that these donations were very likely coming from<br />
sources other than American voters.  This was discussed at length<br />
within the campaign and the decision was made that none of these<br />
donations violated campaign financing laws.</p>
<p>        It was also decided that it was not the responsibility of the<br />
campaign to audit these millions of contributions as to the actual<br />
source (specific credit card number or bank transfer account<br />
numbers) to insure that none of these internet contributors<br />
exceeded the legal maximum donation on a cumulative basis of m any<br />
small donations.  They also found the record keeping was not<br />
complete enough to do it anyway.</p>

<p>The plan is simple, only 3 pages long. The fleshing out of the plan with some details is the job of Congress. The plan is a bold outline of what needs to be done.</p>
<p>The first part of this plan is largely made up of loans and guarantees. This is not money actually spent, but co-signed for by the government. The second part is the provision to buy failed mortgages so they can be liquidated, refinanced, or otherwise sold in an effort to stabilize the real estate markets and save equity for every homeowner in the nation. The cost of this plan to the taxpayer is a net zero if it is played out and managed as planned. </p>
<p>We need to understand that this is the cheapest route to take. As banks fail, the FDIC is responsible for bailing out individual investors. The lack of liquidity in the money markets is causing a multitude of small and large banks to fail. This will cost you the tax payer directly as those deposits have to be paid back by the government. The bail out should prevent that.</p>

<p>This chart has included both the match-up with and without leaners since June 4th.  When McCain started pulling ahead in mid-September, he stopped including the raw numbers and ONLY posted &#8220;with leaners&#8221;.     The raw numbers were being hidden and  the &#8220;with leaners&#8221; numbers (which are subject to PERSONAL interpretation) are the only ones posted.  I called the contact number and spoke to a guy who became VERY defensive and accused me of being a conspiracy theorist. He told me the &#8220;with leaners&#8221; numbers were the only accurate numbers and that he should just remove the column showing the ACTUAL numbers.  I said NO that&#8217;s not the point.  The point is that readers should be given ALL the data so they could draw their own conclusions.  I asked why he was afraid of the REAL numbers and he just said in a mocking voice, &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;m terrified of numbers!&#8221;</p>
<p>If anybody else thinks there&#8217;s something fishy about this you can give him a call as well.  732-776-9777</p>

State polls show McCain winning, yet somehow Bozo has a 9 point lead on the Washington Post/ABC News national poll&#8230;..Hmmmm!

			<p>As I am one with all on here, Obama will never get my vote.  As a life-long Democrat (turned Indy after RBC) I still have many friends asking me how I could vote for McCain?</p>
<p>What about health care?</p>
<p>What about the economy?</p>
<p>What about my retirement?</p>
<p>And I realized that it really is all about the money.  </p>
<p>My congressman, Patrick Murphy of PA, sold his vote for @ $18,000 even tho his district went 67-23 for Hillary.   </p>
<p>And I was watching fox last night as they were interviewing  a man in Fla who was about to lose his home.  He was waiting to decide voting based on home bailout.  </p>
<p>So&#8230;are all votes for sale?  Is all voting just an excercise in &#8220;I want to get mine&#8221;.  Is it a matter of degree, or is each one of us for sale?   </p>
<p>I also want to provide for my children.   I also want healthcare and retirement.  But at what cost? </p>
<p>I hope I don&#8217;t have a price.   I know it&#8217;s not 30 pieces of silver.</p>

                well one thing for sure we can see is that the economy has helped obama and hurt mccain.. from that trend we could speculate that if the economy  worsens obama is going to win..<br />
mccain winning the debates would go a long way in helping him overcome his falling poll numbers because of  the economy<br />
another thing, the wild car could also be mccain unloading some damaging information about obama,that could really change things</p>

Undecided voters not satisfied with both candidates<br />
By LIZ SIDOTI, Associated Press Writer</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — With Wall Street in turmoil and the economy in shambles, whichever presidential candidate convinces a swath of persuadable voters that he gets it — and can be trusted to lead the country back to fiscal stability — could well win the White House.</p>
<p>A recent AP-Yahoo! News poll found that 18 percent of likely voters are up for grabs — undecided or willing to change their minds — little more than five weeks before Americans choose between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.</p>
<p>A large chunk of these voters say they are hurting on a personal level from the country&#8217;s economic woes, and, like everyone else, they say the economy is the top issue. Most haven&#8217;t decided who would best solve their problems as president; neither candidate has an advantage on handling the economy.</p>
<p>Simply put: Most are looking for a better life and a leader to help make it happen — and most haven&#8217;t found what they seek in Obama or McCain.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a person out there who could inspire change, mend the ways of the system and start fixing the economy, but I don&#8217;t think these two are up to the task,&#8221; said Rick Villiere, 39, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y. A married father of two children under age 3, he feels the tug of economic turmoil and says: &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to get ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult simply to stay afloat, says Cristy Jackson, 29, of Hazel Green, Ala. She&#8217;s on disability, her husband was laid off and they have two kids. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have faith in anyone on the economy,&#8221; she says, adding that neither Obama — &#8220;not experienced enough&#8221; — nor McCain — &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t care about people like me who are not even middle class&#8221; — is likely to help her family.</p>
<p>Tough times, tough crowd&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

			<p>The FED&#8217;s bail out of AIG is unusual in that AIG is not a bank, and the FED is usually an entity that loans money to banks to relend. </p>
<p>This crossover is a good thing because AIG is a huge investor. They manage pension funds, 401K funds, many kinds of insurance, and are heavily invested in a variety of things, including real estate loans. If someone does not give these people a loan, many things will very quickly deteriorate. The FED is doing this to keep all those other things funded by AIG and in cooperation with AIG from going broke. This is a loan. It is not a gift. And it has strings attached. The FED has the right to audit, and the right to pull the funds at any time if they find funny stuff.</p>
<p>All of this panic talk is just that: Panic Talk. We need to sit back and take a deep breath, and try to understand the importance of allowing the means we already have in place to stabilize the economy in this way. They could have done it without any fanfare, and have done it a few times with banks without fanfare or the public&#8217;s knowledge. The fact that AIG is not the regular entity that they work with, and the fact that the FED wants public pressure on AIG to comply with the terms of the loan, are the significant features of this transaction.</p>

			<p>polls in virginia this morning as reported by our local news has McCain leading Obama for the first time in this state by 3 points.  The polls do not reflect the facts on the ground, remember that.  Just look at the size of the crowds Obama/Biden, McCain/Palin.  That should be a good indicator of what is REALLY going on.  I heard someone predict before the conventions that if Obama started falling in the polls, the MSM driven polls would mysteriously put him back in the lead.  Also, I am not trying to remind everyone what happened in &#8217;04, but exit polling on election day showed Kerry having a huge win&#8230;.that didn&#8217;t happen.</p>

			<p>Obama has deep pockets and everyone has their hands in them including wall street, it seems that this disaster came at a time when Obama was not polling well, this might sound cynical but my trust in these folks is at zero.  John McCain may not be an eloquent speaker but he appears to be honest and he wants to reshape our nation and make it stable again. I think we are so focused on the economy that we are overlooking our biggest threat, these countries that are waiting for us to fail and to elect a weak president, BO.</p>

    the printing presses will be burning up..but gradually killer inflation will have you spending half your check to buy a bag of groceries  and the other half on gas and energy&#8230;.<br />
                     man the life boats folks.. because thats where were going..take care of your family first or you&#8217;re going to wind up on the streets</p>

			<p>Good evening!  I mentioned the other day that the McCain campaign was previewing a web-ad regarding Chicago are Hispanics and their opinion of Obama.  I went to the Santa Fe preview and I have to say, it was very good!  There was a guy who was a Hillary supporter -Bernard (sorry I didn&#8217;t get his last name) who was from Chicago and he talked very passionately about moving to the McCain camp.  He said that although he was a key supporter of Hillary and had a group of supporters who were very active, Obama NEVER contacted them!  Obama took their votes for granted.  He was very passionate about his support for McCain over Obama and felt that if Hispanics were contacted and understood the differences between the two candidate, Hispanics would come on board for McCain.  There were two videos previewed at this meeting.  The first one was about McCain and his long history with the Hispanic community.  The other video is the web-ad that is currently on the McCain website (<a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Multimedia/" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Multimedia/</a>) and is a walking tour of the Hispanic community in Chicago &#8211; they asked people about Obama.  What did Obama do for Hispanics?  Nada, nada, nada!  The video is also on You Tube but I couldn&#8217;t find it there.  Bernard (the Hispanic guy from Chicago) repeated that it is important to reach out to Hillary supporters &#8211; 10 milion of them &#8211; so that we can get their votes for McCain.  He reiterated that the Democratic Party left their supporters and moved to the far left.  PUMAs &#8211; we have to help New Mexico and other swing states reach out to Democrats who are not comfortable with Obama!!!</p>
