&nbsp;

<P><B>[215]</B> One of the major points of this study is that Madrid created
a community of interests in Spain that transcended regional boundaries.
As part of a dynamic relationship between Madrid and Castile that precluded
a reversion to the economic life of the sixteenth century, that community
of interests nurtured historical structures that have made Spain resistant
to modernization. Recent scholarship has shown the basic differences between
the Spanish coastal and inland economies in many ways. In English, the
best-known work is Earl J. Hamilton's; although he does not address regional
contrasts directly, Hamilton's price data extending from 1350 to 1800 repeatedly
demonstrate the vulnerability of the Spanish interior to subsistence crises.
The coastal provinces, with access to maritime trade, were relatively safe
from such crises and could adjust their agriculture to incentives offered
by external markets. Catalonia and Valencia also had separate monetary
systems which afforded some protection from the manipulations of the Castilian
coinage.<SUP><A HREF="#N_1_"> (1)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Pierre Vilar has documented
both the sluggishness of the Catal&aacute;n economy and the expansiveness
of Castile's in the sixteenth century, and the reversal of the situation
in the eighteenth.<SUP><A HREF="#N_2_"> (2)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
Vicens Vives notes the close interaction of the two economies in the sixteenth
century. The woolens crisis of 1548-58 and price rises later in the century
were felt with comparable intensity in both regions; but unlike Castile,
Catal&aacute;n prosperity was not the result of domestic development--indeed,
Catalonia's late sixteenth-century expansion was externally induced by
diversion of traffic from the Sevilla-Castile-Burgos circuit <B>[216]</B>
into the Mediterranean because of hostilities in the Atlantic. The seventeenth
century saw depression in both areas, with only Catalonia showing much
sign of recovery before 1700. By the eighteenth century, population, commercial,
and wage trends in Madrid and Barcelona diverged in a manner that clearly
identifies Catalonia as a much more dynamic region.<SUP><A HREF="#N_3_">

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Historians often refer to
the coastal periphery of Spain as though it were a unified economic system
providing convenient contrast with a static, homogeneous, and isolated
interior. In fact, of course, neither the interior nor the coastal fringe
was as homogeneous as our framework in Chapter 1 suggested, and some aspects
of the dualism are as well explained by the differing social structures
of Castile, Arag&oacute;n, and Portugal as by geography. Nevertheless,
to understand how Madrid affected the course of events we must have a clear
perception of the economic evolution of both the peninsular interior and
its maritime periphery.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sixteenth-century Castile
proved that a narrow base of movable surpluses could be used to create
an urban network, an industrial sector, and a mercantile system capable
of linking regional economic life to external markets. The domestic components
of this commercial system were vulnerable to population growth, diminishing
returns, and international price differences; but the factor that most
precisely paralleled the actual breakdown of this fragile economic structure
was the emergence of Madrid. Sustained by rents, taxes, and commodities
drawn from a worldwide political empire, Madrid reoriented the limited
marketable supplies in Castile. The impact on the regional urban network
resulted in Toledo's fall from primate city to provincial backwater and
can be seen in the history of commercial activity in other interior cities.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The coastal areas had no
such common point of reference, though they all shared access to the sea.
Some regions became involved in long-distance maritime exchange, Barcelona
and Sevilla-C&aacute;diz being the preeminent examples. Others, like the
northern coastal districts from San Sebasti&aacute;n to Vigo, developed
a self-sufficiency analogous to, but qualitatively different from, that
of interior areas. Coastal trade meant that Galicia sometimes ate French
wheat and Vizcaya sometimes used Gallego wine. Despite its inward orientation,
Guip&uacute;zcoa, for example, was constantly preoccupied with supply by
sea, and never experienced the supply crises that crippled seventeenth-century
Castile.<SUP><A HREF="#N_4_"> (4)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the coastal regions
had in common the economic possibilities inherent in access to the sea,
the varied fortunes of Vizcaya, Galicia, Sevilla, and <B>[218]</B> Catalonia
attest that they were not able to exploit them to the same degree, or in
the same ways. These differences were more pronounced in the sixteenth
century than later. By the eighteenth century, the maritime commercial
trends and economic changes of the coastal fringe exhibited two important
trends: increasing divergence from the pattern of the interior, and increasingly
similar responses to economic stimuli originating in northern Europe.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Whatever linkages and common
social patterns may have existed between coastal and interior parts of
the peninsula in the sixteenth century, by the eighteenth they clearly
operated under distinctive economic conditions. Provincial variations in
the prices of basic foodstuffs indicate substantial differences in market
conditions between the interior and the periphery. During subsistence crises,
food prices in the interior fluctuated two to three times as much as on
the periphery.<SUP><A HREF="#N_5_"> (5)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
This pattern persisted into the second half of the nineteenth century and
has been documented for the crises of 1856-57 and 1866-69, when the price
of wheat in the interior rose to four times as much as in coastal towns.<SUP><A HREF="#N_6_">
(6)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> Such evidence
is not the entire story behind regional differences, and we must not succumb
entirely to geographical determinism. But the fact remains that social
structures limited by the geography of the Spanish interior had fewer economic
options than similar ones with access to the sea and cheap transport. Their
possibilities may not always have been exploited, and the reasons may lie
in social not geographic realities, but the most traditional coastal region
has an economic history quite different from that of an interior region
organized by the same society.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While much of the interior
became oriented to Madrid, Madrid in turn depended on periphery and empire.
So long as the empire included a commercial system that provided taxes
and private fortunes, Madrid prospered and the Crown could mediate between
empire on the one hand and interior on the other. Centralization caused
tensions between the Crown and Catalonia and the Basque provinces, as witnessed
by the Catal&aacute;n revolt of 1640, the Bourbon conquest of Catalonia
in the War of Succession, and the attacks on Basque autonomy in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. But the economic subjugation and stagnation of
the interior in the seventeenth century, while European commerce encouraged
coastal regions to specialize for distant markets, aggravated the tension
between the landlocked and maritime economies tied together by Crown and
capital city. By the end of the eighteenth century, though ostensibly successful,
the peninsular system had become extremely fragile. Since Madrid lived
in two economic worlds, we must <B>[219]</B> trace the chronologies of
both to perceive how the capital followed the trends of the larger world
while reshaping the urban system of Castile.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three Spanish coastal centers
were perennially linked with the maritime world of Europe--Barcelona, C&aacute;diz/Sevilla,
and the Basque provinces--and each had a different relationship with its
peninsular hinterland. At Barcelona, overseas commerce interacted with
the Catal&aacute;n hinterland and the economy of the port itself. Barcelona
functioned as an entrepot between the international market and a regional
economy featuring specialized agriculture and craft industries that were
moving toward industrial development on the English pattern by the end
of the eighteenth century. Sevilla and C&aacute;diz were entrepots for
European goods on the way to America and colonial products on the way to
Europe. In the mid-sixteenth century, Sevilla served as an entrepot like
Barcelona, linking Indies trade with Andalusian agriculture and the Castilian
textile industry. But by the seventeenth century, Sevilla and C&aacute;diz
were little more than clearinghouses for trade between the Spanish empire
and Europe. Except for export of wool, sherry, and olive oil, the links
between seaport and hinterland were confined to urban supply and provision
of the mercantile fleet.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The third maritime center
was in the Basque provinces, part of the maritime fringe of the northern
coast. Vizcaya became the transit area for departing Castilian wool and
incoming European manufactures destined for the Spanish interior--a trade
that involved Castilian markets but had few links with the Basque hinterland.
Associated with these three areas were the coastal trading circuits of
the Mediterranean and northern littorals, also part of what we have referred
to as the "periphery."</SPAN>

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thanks to Pierre Vilar,
we can construct a profile of commercial trends in Catalonia based on port
duties in Barcelona and in the smaller ports of the Catal&aacute;n littoral
(see Tables 10.1 and 10.2). These figures verify that in the first two-thirds
of the sixteenth century Barcelona recovered very slowly from its medieval
depression. Adjusted for changes in the composite Spanish price indices,
the value of traffic at Barcelona appears static until 1578, and only in
the last quarter of the century did it increase significantly.<SUP><A HREF="#N_7_">
(7)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> This reflects
the <B>[220]</SPAN></B> diversion of Italian capital that had financed
the medieval Italy-Barcelona-Valencia-Balearics trade circuit to the Italy-Sevilla-Lisbon-Bruges
circuit. In the late sixteenth century, however, the situation in northern
Europe disrupted that trade, diverting Spanish wool to Mediterranean ports
and causing a shift of Spain's European commerce to the Barcelona-Genoa-Austria
route.<SUP><A HREF="#N_8_"> (8)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
The induced nature of Barcelona's revival is attested by the tendency for
prices there to follow those of Sevilla, indicating that Barcelona was
exposed to inflationary pressures originating in America.<SUP><A HREF="#N_9_">(9)</A></SUP>

<P>Barcelona lost considerable ground in the first half of the seventeenth
<B>[221] </B>century, but by the third quarter of the century there was
a substantial recovery that survived the deflation and subsistence crises
of 1677-85. When adjusted for Barcelona prices, the average yield in 1693-99
was 10% below that of 1679-82, but the level of traffic sustained through
the fourth quarter remained high. The recovery in Barcelona may have begun
during the French occupation in the 1640's, and was furthered by the penetration
of French capital into the Mediterranean and C&aacute;diz trades.<SUP><A HREF="#N_10_">
(10)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The growth of Barcelona and
its hinterland was more apparent in the eighteenth century, as reflected
in the indices of port duty yields (Table 10.2). Port duty revenues rose
378% between 1760-64 and 1790-98, and it is unlikely that adjustment for
inflation could change this impression of spectacular growth.<SUP><A HREF="#N_11_">
(11)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> Moreover,
the port duties (<I>lleuda</I>) in the outlying ports of the Catal&aacute;n
coast, collected as fixed fees and therefore immune to inflation, increased
an impressive 188% by 1790-98. If the Barcelona series could be accurately
deflated, it would still show a similar rate of growth. The indicators
for both the region and the capital show steady expansion of commercial
activity in the first half of the eighteenth century, extending the trend
of the late seventeenth. Growth accelerated after 1750 as the city's population
rose from 30,000 inhabitants early in the century to 100,000 by 1800.<SUP><A HREF="#N_12_">
(12)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From the mid-seventeenth
century, Barcelona was becoming a center of Mediterranean trade and an
intermediate stop between Marseilles and C&aacute;diz, as French activity
at C&aacute;diz created a flow of traffic along Spain's Mediterranean <B>[222]</B>
coast. The parallel expansion of traffic in Barcelona and the smaller regional
ports indicates that economic expansion took place in the context of a
network of ports, rather than at a single convenient stopping place.<SUP><A HREF="#N_13_">
(13)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> This commercial
growth reflected the development of domestic industry and intensive agriculture
in Catalonia; a re-export trade giving Spanish-American sugar-growing importance
in the Mediterranean; and a growing stream of Catal&aacute;n and French
manufactures destined for M&aacute;laga, C&aacute;diz, and America.<SUP><A HREF="#N_14_">
(14)</A></SUP> The expansion of commercial activity at Barcelona after
1796, however, is an illusion reflecting the impact of price inflation
on <I>ad valorem</I> duties. But if the real value of traffic at Barcelona
stagnated or declined, it rose in the outports as the regional market system
adjusted to disruption of commerce in its major port.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even this sophisticated regional
economy, however, was limited by geographic realities. Its direct connections
with the Castilian interior were few, and its economic activities did not
penetrate very far inland. Economic change remained slow in the mountain
and inland regions of Catalonia and, while rents rose rapidly along the
coast, they remained much lower inland. The impressive investments in drainage
and irrigation were concentrated near the coast or the Ebro River, and
most of it was within 30 miles of Barcelona itself.<SUP><A HREF="#N_15_">
(15)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> The peripheral
nature of this development is documented by its location on the coastal
fringe and by its orientation to Spain's maritime economy.<SUP><A HREF="#N_16_">

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">B. Sevilla-C&aacute;diz</SPAN>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Spain's second major link
with the maritime world was the Indies trade, first at Sevilla and later
at C&aacute;diz. Whether measured by the tonnage of trade with the Indies
in the sixteenth century or by its contribution to national income as measured
by the <I>Catastro</I> of 1750, the importance of this port complex is
manifest.<SUP><A HREF="#N_17_"> (17)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
Between colonial remittances, customs duties, <I>alcabalas</I>, and tobacco
monopoly revenues, the old province of Sevilla (modern Sevilla, Huelva,
and C&aacute;diz) provided nearly half of royal revenues in the late eighteenth
century. Its network of merchant families, Andalusian nobles, and <B>[223]</B>
privileged guilds formed an integral part of the imperial power structure,
reflecting the interpenetration of public and private interests and providing
the Crown with a major source of credit.</SPAN>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. <I>Maritime Activity</SPAN></I>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Four indicators provide
a long-term profile of overseas commerce in this port complex--the familiar
figures on the tonnage of Indies trade to 1650, a small ad valorem tax
on goods handled by the <I>Consulado</I> of Sevilla (1551-1700), a 0.5%
<I>aduanilla</I> collected <I>ad valorem</I> by the city of C&aacute;diz
(1656-1800), and the estimates of Indies tonnage developed by Garcia-Baquero
for the eighteenth century. These are presented as index numbers in Tables
10.3, 10.4, and 10.5, indicating where appropriate both nominal and price-adjusted
levels of tax revenue.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These figures suggest that
the recovery of Andalusian commerce, so apparent in the eighteenth century,
actually began between 1650 and 1700, and that it was in the later seventeenth
century that the drastic decline of the official American trade monoply
was reversed. The transition is obscured by evidence of contraband, monetary
instability, and the fact that Garc&iacute;a-Baquero's tonnage estimates
only begin in 1680. Without a longer perspective, they suggest an end-of-century
decline prolonged by the War of Spanish Succession. Table 10.4 contradicts
this trend and, even when adjusted for price fluctuations, shows a substantial
recovery of port activity after a low point in the 1660's. The most pronounced
change coincides with the official transfer of Indies trade to C&aacute;diz,
but the concurrent doubling of port duty revenue at Sevilla is noteworthy.
The volume of trade in question was undeniably small, but the trend is
similar to that in Barcelona--recovery in the third quarter of the century,
with a mild setback in the final decade.&nbsp;</SPAN>

<BR>The principal link between this port activity and the peninsular interior
was the resource base of revenue and credit that Andalusian commerce produced
for the government in Madrid. Sevilla's maritime commerce had been separated
from the economy of the Spanish interior by the early seventeenth century.
At the end of the century, even the immediate Andalusian hinterland of
the two major ports was but lightly involved with the imperial monopoly,
exporting a modest 40,000 arrobas of wine and 6,000 arrobas of olive oil

10.4 gives the real and nominal index values for the <I>blanca</I> of Sevilla
and the <I>aduanilla</I> of C&aacute;diz, both of which were minor <I>ad
valorem</I> taxes similar to the port duty (<I>peritage</I>) of Barcelona,
and the index of Indies tonnage as offered by Garc&iacute;a-Baquero. The
<I>ad valorem</I> indicators are presented with index numbers for both
their nominal value and their value adjusted for Andalusian price levels.
Since both port duties were collected <I>ad</I><B> [225]</SPAN></B> <I>valorem</I>,
the adjusted figures are likely to be more accurate, and conflict with
the trend of Indies tonnage, which drifts downward until 1709.<SUP><A HREF="#N_19_">
(19)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> It can
be argued that regionally based commerce, illicit American trade, and general
port activity rose during 1675-1700 outside the legal Indies monopoly.
This would be consistent with the revival of commerce in Barcelona and
with the growth of trade all around the Atlantic. It also coincides with
indications of a substantial increase in the flow of American silver through
private channels. The scale of fraud in the official Indies monopoly was
large enough to suggest that the official tonnages may reflect aspects
of Atlantic trade that had little to do with Andaluc&iacute;a.<SUP><A HREF="#N_20_">
(20)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> Thus it
is plausible to suggest a modest reversal of the seventeenth-century trade
decline in coastal Andaluc&iacute;a after 1670, even while the interior
went through the prolonged crisis of 1677-85.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The magnitude of this recovery
after the 1660's should not be overstated. Hamilton's silver prices indicate
that the silver equivalent of the Sevilla <I>Consulado</I> tax in the 1690's
was only about 12.5% of that for 1601-10, but <B>[226]</B> the proportionate
drop in Indies tonnage was far greater.<SUP><A HREF="#N_21_"> (21)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
Nevertheless, the seventeenth-century decline had been reversed. The fact
that port duties in both Andalusian ports follow the same chronology indicates
a quickening of regional commercial life only partly connected with the
American trade.<SUP><A HREF="#N_22_"> (22)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
This is reinforced by the trend of traffic on the ferry from C&aacute;diz
to Puerto Santa Maria, outport for the Jerez district. Revenue from this
ferry rose 150% from the late 1650's to the 1680's and remained fairly
high in the 1690's. Since the fare was not an <I>ad valorem</I> tax, revenues
were not affected by prices.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eighteenth century saw
an expansion of commerce at C&aacute;diz that can now be seen as a continuation
of the modest expansion of the last quarter of the seventeenth (see Table
10.5). Indies tonnage, the <I>aduanilla</I> of C&aacute;diz, and the cross-bay
ferry all show a recession during the War of Spanish Succession. This began
in the 1 690's for the Indies monopoly; but in the years from 1709 to 1720,
all of these trends were sharply reversed. Indies tonnage rose 175% between
the 1720's and the 1770's, as did the nominal value of the port tax in
C&aacute;diz. Adjusted for Andalusian prices, however, the value of that
revenue rose much more slowly. The price-adjusted <I>aduanilla</I> suggests
a long-term increase in port activity from 1680 to about 1725. Then, while
the volume of Indies tonnage rose, the port revenue drifted downward until
1760, followed by a sustained increase in real value until 1792. Traffic
in the bay area, as shown by revenue from the <I>barca de Sancti Petri</I>,
rose sharply after the succession war. In part this reflects suppression
of the Puerto Real and Puerto Santa Maria ferries; and when the royal highway
to C&aacute;diz was completed, ferry revenues dropped substantially.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Tonnage data is not available
after 1778, but following the reforms of that year the official value of
legal Indies trade rose dramatically, and in 1792 it was five times that
of 1778.<SUP><A HREF="#N_23_"> (23)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
This is an increase far in excess of the unadjusted <I>aduanilla</I> revenue,
indicating a trend independent of the regional economy served by C&aacute;diz.
After 1797 the Indies trade was subjected to violent fluctuations due to
the international situation, and declined rapidly. The value of exports
in 1797 was about 300 million <I>reales</I>, slightly over half of which
were registered as of domestic origin. In several subsequent years the
value dropped to 10% of that figure, while the intervening peaks never
reached the earlier highs. In 1815-21, the value of exports was typically
75 million <I>reales</I>, two-thirds of domestic origin. The demise of
the colonial trade <B>[227]</B> of the eighteenth century was completed
by 1828, when Spain's total foreign trade was less than a quarter of that
of 1792, and exports from C&aacute;diz totaled less than 9 million reales.<SUP><A HREF="#N_24_">
(24)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The Ports and the Interior</SPAN>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This bare outline of commercial
trends in Sevilla and C&aacute;diz summarizes a commercial life that in
the later eighteenth century represented half of all of Spain's exports
and imports. Yet the ties to Madrid and the interior were surprisingly
sparse, consisting of a few commercial links and a structure of credit,
taxes, and political influence. This was not always the case, and it is
instructive to look briefly at the history of the connections between maritime
trade and the interior.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The middle decades of the
sixteenth century saw a close association between the expansion of the
Indies trade and the growth of the textile industries in Malaga, Granada,
Toledo, Segovia, and other Castilian towns. The wine and wheat production
of Andaluc&iacute;a was similarly affected. Consequently, the Andalusian
urban system evolved like that of the Castilian towns. C&oacute;rdoba,
largest town of inland western Andaluc&iacute;a, grew from 5,851 <I>vecinos</I>
in 1530 to about 13,000 by 1594. Thereafter depression set in, as demand
for cloth declined, taxes rose, and epidemics hit the region. Urban growth
ceased and the city began to decline.<SUP><A HREF="#N_25_"> (25)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
This pattern was repeated in relatively small communities such as Pedroches
to the north of C&oacute;rdoba, where sixteenth-century expansion was also
followed by rapid decline.<SUP><A HREF="#N_26_"> (26)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the sixteenth century
wore on, domestic industry was unable to satisfy the Indies trade, and
a growing proportion of the rising volume of exports came from foreign
sources. This marks a critical phase in the separation of the Spanish interior
from the economy of the Sevilla-C&aacute;diz zone. Long before the tonnage
of the Indies trade reached its peak in 1610, domestic industrial exports
were in full decline, and the capture of imperial trade by non-Spanish
merchants was generally recognized. It was paralleled by Italian takeover
of the wool trade, as wool exports were diverted from northern outlets
and taken over by Italian merchants in the southern and eastern ports of
the peninsula.<SUP><A HREF="#N_27_"> (27)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
In the early seventeenth century, Spanish America, Andaluc&iacute;a, and
central Spain experienced depressions, each for different immediate causes.<SUP><A HREF="#N_28_">
(28)</A></SUP> The Andalusian ports remained an avenue for legal trade
between <B>[228]</B> Europe and Spanish America, but played an increasingly
passive role. The merchant community of Sevilla became a group of commission
agents dependent on government maintenance of an obsolete commercial structure.<SUP><A HREF="#N_29_">
(29)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The marginalization of Spanish
commercial activity at Sevilla is illustrated by the trend of the tax that
the <I>Consulado</I> collected there. The real value of its revenue rose
15-20% between 1551 and 1590, then began to decline rapidly well before
the tonnage of the Indies trade. This reflects the declining participation
of Castilian products in imperial trade and correlates with the decline
of the smaller textile centers of the interior. The loss of contact with
the interior is also apparent if we contrast the distribution of bullion
from Sevilla to the interior in 1575 with the distribution of letters of
credit held by a major Sevilla trading firm in 1603.<SUP><A HREF="#N_30_">
(30)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> Of 253 peninsular
credit instruments, 77% involved western Andaluc&iacute;a and 18% the Mediterranean
coast. Only 9.8% mentioned interior locations, and virtually all of those
were from southern Extremadura. This dismantling of commerce into the interior
reflects the situation in Toledo, where merchants were unable to maintain
their coastal trading connections after 1600.<SUP><A HREF="#N_31_"> (31)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The dissolution of the commercial
links between the Andalusian ports and Old and New Castile is illustrated
by the <I>portazgo</I> of Zafra, owned by the Duke of Medinaceli and situated
on the main route from Sevilla through Extremadura toward Madrid and Valladolid.
To the extent that traffic was not being diverted to the Sevilla-Madrid
route along the Guadalquivir valley, this road toll illustrates the decline
of traffic from Sevilla to the interior. The scattered figures for the
sixteenth century suggest a rising volume of traffic that peaked in 1604-05.
Comparison with the Chaunus' figures on the tonnage at Sevilla indicates
that the inland traffic through Extremadura was well developed before the
expansion of the Indies trade (see Table 10.6).</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Traffic at Zafra expanded
30% in the last half of the sixteenth century, while the Indies trade trebled
and the real value of the <I>ad valorem</I> tax on merchandise at Sevilla
increased 15-20% (1551-90). The Zafra toll revenues fell by a third between
1604-05 and 1630, then collapsed drastically with the revolt in nearby
Portugal. The trend at Zafra follows closely the timing of trends in the
Indies trade--but its decline, even before the Portuguese revolt, was far
more rapid (58% vs. 35% to 1640). Thus while Spanish participation in the
Indies trade declined, the role of the interior in the maritime economy
declined even faster. The <I>portazgo</I> of Zafra continued to fall drastically
in the <B>[229]</SPAN></B>&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1650's,
as the war with Portugal continued; it recovered slightly in the '60's
and '70's, then became negligible.</SPAN>

<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thus traffic from Andaluc&iacute;a
into western Spain was active in the sixteenth century and responded to
the trade at Sevilla, but its seventeenth-century decline was rapid and
more abrupt than the decline of traffic at Sevilla. Sevilla's contact with
the commercial structure of sixteenth-century Castile was broken and its
trade to the interior either declined or shifted to routes which went directly
to Madrid. The pattern is repeated within western Andaluc&iacute;a by the
collapse of C&oacute;rdoba, which declined from 13,000 <I>vecinos</I> in
1594 to 7,000 in 1626-33, a trend again echoed in smaller communities such
as Pedroches.<SUP><A HREF="#N_32_"> (32)</A></SUP> The new separation is
apparent in the seventeenth century, as <B>[230]</B> interior regional
economies declined earlier and faster than did the Sevilla trade. Its persistence
is suggested by developments in the last half of the century. As C&oacute;rdoba
and its region recovered after 1650, they achieved a precarious stability
that lasted well into the eighteenth century, but such interior trends
evidence little correlation with renewed port activity at Sevilla and C&aacute;diz.<SUP><A HREF="#N_33_">
(33)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By the later seventeenth
century, the underlying limitations of pre-industrial life were sharply
exposed in Andaluc&iacute;a. The basic reliance on self-sufficiency that
characterized noncoastal Spain through the eighteenth century was more
prominent than ever.<SUP><A HREF="#N_34_"> (34)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
This left only a limited market economy in which rudimentary transportation
hauled valuable oil to Madrid and the north, supplied Sevilla, serviced
a few mines, and provided a trickle of wine and oil for the Indies trade.<SUP><A HREF="#N_35_">
(35)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> Agricultural
output expanded only as the growing population plowed up more land, while
marketable surpluses were produced largely by tithes and rents. In fact,
western Andaluc&iacute;a saw an increase in rural output after 1715, but
the peak was reached well before the end of the century and reflected the
regional balance between land and population.<SUP><A HREF="#N_36_"> (36)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Indicators of commercial
activity in eighteenth-century Andaluc&iacute;a, such as brokerage fees
on cargo leaving Sevilla by land and gate tolls at C&oacute;rdoba, show
that even at its peak, port activity had little connection with the interior
(see Table 10.7). While Indies tonnage and port duty revenue at C&aacute;diz
rose steadily until 1790, the two inland duties show no such trend. That
of Sevilla, when adjusted for price changes, remained stable until the
inflation of the 1790's depressed its price-adjusted value, while the short
C&oacute;rdoba series declined noticeably from 1750 to 1779. Even without
adjustment for the effects of price change, the trends verify the growing
separation between regional and maritime commerce already noted in the
seventeenth century.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This is further reflected
in the role of Spanish products in exports to the to the Indies. Andaluc&iacute;a
supplied wine and olive oil, employing commercial arrangements and landowner
participation similar to those of the Madrid supply trade. But the volume
of goods was not great and a generous estimate puts the Spanish share of
legal exports in 1750 at 16% by value and 50% by volume. The evidence regarding
manufactures originating in Spain documents the absence of interior Castile
from the export trade. Of 10,000 tons of textiles shipped to the Indies
in 1749-51, only 12 tons (30 mule loads annually)</SPAN>&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">came
from the largest textile complex of the interior, the royal factories at
Guadalajara and San Fernando.<SUP><A HREF="#N_37_"> (37)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
This correlates with the location of people who took out licenses to place
cargo in the Indies trade. Between 1743 and 1778, 43% were from C&aacute;diz
and Andaluc&iacute;a, 35% from provinces on the northern coast, and 5%
from Mediterranean ports. Only 11% were located in the vast interior of
Old and New Castile, Le&oacute;n, and Extremadura, and two-thirds of that
11 % were in the wool-producing provinces of Soria, Logro&ntilde;o, and
Burgos.</SPAN>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The very structure
of the trade worked against participation by the weak industrial sector.
As plantation crops (sugar, cacao, tobacco) became more important among
imports, the demand for American-bound exports shifted to manufactures,
the trade goods hardest for Spain to produce. In the second quarter of
the eighteenth century, manufactures constituted 54% of the value of exports,
while in the third quarter they reached 72%.<SUP><A HREF="#N_38_"> (38)</A></SUP>
Spain's lack of participation in the trade is suggested by the origins
of letters of credit and bills of exchange held by the largest commercial
house of Sevilla as of 1803. Of several hundred bills, only 25 or 30 involved
any part of Spain, while the vast majority came from England, France, the
Low Countries, and Germany. Only the collapse of colonial trade after 1800
reoriented these commercial connections to Spain. In 1813-18, many European
contacts remained, but the same trading house had numerous new connections
with Madrid, Andaluc&iacute;a, and the Basque provinces, foreshadowing
the structure of Spain's later commercial economy. By the 1850's, commercial
contacts between Sevilla and Europe were much reduced, while those with
the north coast of Spain persisted. Madrid became relatively more important
to Sevillan merchants, and interior Andaluc&iacute;a became the real basis
of the city's trade.<SUP><A HREF="#N_39_"> (39)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><B>[232]</B> C. The Mediterranean
Maritime Fringe</SPAN>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The port complexes of western
Andaluc&iacute;a and Catalonia mark the two extremes of Spain's long Mediterranean
coast, a coast dotted with smaller seaports like Valencia, Alicante, Cartagena,
and M&aacute;laga. After somewhat disparate experiences in the sixteenth
century, this entire coastal fringe began a modest commercial recovery
well before 1700, contradicting the prevailing impression of depression
and stagnation in late Hapsburg Spain. The evidence is far from complete,
but Barcelona and C&aacute;diz were only the most obvious parts of a commercial
circuit that involved other Mediterranean ports as well.</SPAN>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The Sixteenth Century</SPAN>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The timing of commercial
trends varied during the sixteenth century depending on local factors,
but most ports were involved in the upswing of commercial activity that
marked the last quarter of the century in Barcelona and Sevilla. Prices
in Valencia show remarkably small cyclical swings compared with Castile
and generally parallel those of Barcelona, indicating that both cities
relied on Mediterranean connections for important supplies. Valencian port
activity indicates notable prosperity in the fifteenth and early sixteenth
centuries. Ship entries and port revenues (<I>peatges</I>) were high in
1503-10, drifted downward through the 1530's to a low in the 1550's, then
show a strong recovery through the last quarter of the century. The strength
of this trend is uncertain, as Table 10.8 illustrates. Judging from ship
entries, the actual trend was between the two sets of revenue indices.
While the volume of shipping dropped with port revenues at mid-sixteenth
century, in the last quarter it was just above that for the first decade.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Valencia's late medieval
prosperity reflected the disturbances in fifteenth-century Catalonia, while
the mid-century decline probably indicates diversion of commercial capital
to Sevilla. The later recovery coincides with the <I>Morisco</I> rebellion
of 1568, the breakup of Atlantic commerce, and the diversion of the wool
trade and political communications to Mediterranean outlets. The little-studied
port of Alicante, an outport of Valencia a third its size, followed the
same outline.<SUP><A HREF="#N_40_"> (40)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<HR WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The
recovery of port activity in the later sixteenth century reflects the internal
development of the province of Valencia. The population rose 50% between
1570 and 1609, although much of the increase took place among the <I>Moriscos</I>.
Settled in poorer and more isolated areas, they contributed little to <B>[233]&nbsp;</SPAN></B>
the market economy. The Christian population, which rose rapidly in 1548-71,
grew more slowly in the later decades, but the overall pressure was strong
enough to prompt migration from Valencia to Castile despite the population
problems there.<SUP><A HREF="#N_41_"> (41)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
A growing population rented more land for farming, creating a boom in the
value of rents and tithes. This is illustrated by examples of the royal
share of the tithe, the nominal value of which increased 525% between the
1560's and 1601-10. Even when adjusted for price changes, the increase
was about 215%, implying a large jump in the amount of wealth captured
by landed and urban elites.<SUP><A HREF="#N_42_"> (42)</A></SUP> This is
the type of rural trend that allowed rural distress and port activity to
develop simultaneously.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The pattern in sixteenth-century
M&aacute;laga differed considerably. M&aacute;laga had been a center of
the Moorish silk industry and served both as port of entry for goods destined
for Granada and outlet for raisins and sweet wines. She was the official
supply port for the African <I>presidios</I> and early became a participant
in the Indies trade. The nominal value of the silk industry grew rapidly
during the first half of the century, but it is difficult to measure the
actual rate of growth without reliable silk prices. In 1501-50 the decennial
averages of the general price index in Andaluc&iacute;a rose 103%, while
the nominal value of the silk tax rose 175%. In the next two decades, prices
rose 32% while silk tax revenues increased 92% (see Table 10.9). Thus we
can infer that the silk industry in M&aacute;laga grew steadily before
1550, and then at a more rapid rate until the Morisco revolt at the end
of the 1560's. In this, M&aacute;laga was following the pattern of towns
like Florence,<SUP><A HREF="#N_43_"> (43)</A></SUP> and responding to the
<B>[234]</SPAN></B>&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">development
of Sevilla as the empire developed. Thus she avoided the mid-century slump
that affected Valencia and Barcelona.</SPAN>

growth in the Granada region until about 1570, followed by political and
demographic instability after the <I>Morisco</I> rebellion of 1568. Despite
difficulties, M&aacute;laga remained an important transit port in the Mediterranean
trade to Sevilla and Lisbon and, along with Alicante and Cartagena, was
a redistribution center for colonial products.<SUP><A HREF="#N_45_"> (45)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Port activity paralleled
provincial population, which declined 30% due to the expulsion of the <I>Moriscos</I>,
and 35% by 1650. The impact on agricultural production was softened because
much of the vacated land was marginal or was quickly resettled by Christian
peasants. By the 1630's, production as documented by tithes had reached
the nominal value of the sixteenth-century peak, although this was offset
by wheat prices that were 25% higher.<SUP><A HREF="#N_49_"> (49)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
The expulsion of the <I>Moriscos</I> caused serious economic adjustments,
while the collapse of Toledo hurt the Valencian silk industry.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Silk production declined
seriously during the seventeenth century despite a shift to lower-quality
products as Castilian purchasing power fell. Dependent on the Toledo-based
trading network of the interior, the collapse of this industry destroyed
important linkages between periphery and interior. There are signs of a
revival of silk production at the end of the seventeenth century, but the
only connection with the interior was the Madrid market; and in contrast
with the sixteenth century, the revival depended much more on trade connections
outside of Spain. This is but one of a number of indications of <B>[237]</B>
declining association with the interior. James Casey suggests a rigidification
of rural society and economy in which, despite Valencia's position as a
seaport, the region was caught in a developmental stalemate of rural misery,
inequality, and Mafia-style local power structures.<SUP><A HREF="#N_50_">
(50)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In general, Castillo Pintado's
analysis of the early seventeenth century in Valencia is overly optimistic.
The partial recovery of economic life by the 1640's is clear, however,
and the relative strength of the Valencian economy is suggested by the
appearance of Castilian silver coinage after 1640, a reflection of the
diversion of Barcelona traffic to Valencia during the Thirty Years' War.<SUP><A HREF="#N_51_">
(51)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> The recovery
of port activity appears stronger in the period 1660-80, after which it
established a plateau concurrent with those in Barcelona and M&aacute;laga.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In Cartagena, the level of
port activity was high well into the seventeenth century, reaching its
peak in the second decade and paralleling the cycle of the Indies trade
and the Mediterranean conjuncture.<SUP><A HREF="#N_52_"> (52)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
The price-adjusted index of port activity, however, shows an extremely
sharp drop after 1630, with port revenues falling a third by 1650, and
the <I>renta mayor</I> by two-thirds. The price-adjusted indicators reached
their nadir in the 1660's, after which the index for the <I>mollages</I>
jumped 25% and that for the <I>renta mayor</I> 85% between 1671 and 1700.
This fits with evidence that agricultural output in the Murcia area declined
between 1604 and 1670, followed by rising production past the end of the
century.<SUP><A HREF="#N_53_"> (53)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
Thus the decline in Cartagena came later and was sharper than in Valencia,
while the adjusted indices show unambiguous growth in commercial activity
beginning at roughly the same time as in Barcelona and Valencia.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Other Cartagena series reflect
the changing relationship of the port to the interior. The <I>renta mayor</I>
and <I>mollages</I> (see Tables 10.10 and 10.11) reflect port activity
and the economy of the city itself, while the <I>corredur&iacute;a</I>
and <I>saca del pescado</I> (see Table 10.12) taxed goods leaving the city
for the interior. The <I>renta</I> and <I>mollages</I> of Cartagena declined
in the 1630's, although revenues on goods moving into the interior did
not. The <I>corredur&iacute;a</I> did not collapse until the 1640's, while
the volume offish shipped inland remained large through the 1650's.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The <I>corredur&iacute;a</I>
indicates a low volume of goods moving inland except in the 1670's--a time
when American bullion began to lubricate many aspects of long-distance
commerce in Spain.<SUP><A HREF="#N_54_"> (54)</A></SUP> The movement of
fish inland remained <B>[238]</SPAN></B>&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">substantial
until 1690, except during the crisis years in the late 1670's (see Table
10.13). Then, while the adjusted renta rose 62% in the last quarter of
the century, the tax on fish moving inland dropped drastically and the
volume of merchandise heading inland fell back to the midcentury low.</SPAN>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>Expansion of port traffic was underway from the 1670's. Although the
taxes on goods re-exported from Cartagena to the interior indicate a decline
in that traffic, port traffic in Cartagena was increasing. Connections
with the interior that had been important early in the seventeenth century
had dissolved, and port activity was now more an outgrowth of coastal trade
or the economic life in the provincial hinterland. The pattern is very
like that observed for Andalucia and Valencia.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additional light is thrown
on these trends by descriptive evidence from Alicante, midway between Valencia
and Cartagena. The city shows a heavy preponderance of imports which were
financed with American silver and a large part of which went on to Madrid.
Imports were preponderantly French (39%), English (24%), or of Low Countries
origin (22%), illustrating both the nature of the Cadiz-to-Marseilles coastal
trade and the narrow nature of coastal contacts with the interior. This
trade is further illustrated by the activities of an established merchant
in Alicante, Felipe de Moscoso. Beginning in 1661 he built up an import-export
business which dealt regularly in goods from suppliers located in ports
from Venice to Lisbon and occasionally; in London, Amsterdam, and Hamburg;
he routinely exported soap, agricultural commodities, wine, and wool while
importing European manufactures and iron and colonial sugar and tobacco.<SUP><A HREF="#N_55_">

best indicator of commercial trends in M&aacute;laga is a brokerage fee
on raisins and wine exported through the port. The nominal yield of this
<I>correduria</SPAN></I> <I>de pasas y vino</I> (see Tables 10.10 and 10.11)
reveals sustained port activity through the earlier seventeenth century.
Even when adjusted for price levels, traffic appears to have fallen only
8% from 1611 to 1650. The nominal value of the revenue continued to rise
until 1670 and then fell by 50% in two decades, but when adjusted for price
changes the fluctuations are much smaller. The adjusted index of traffic
is stable in the middle decades of the seventeenth century, drops by a
third in the 1670's, then stabilizes at the lower level in the 1680's.
This parallels Garcia-Baquero's description of the volume of shipping in
the C&aacute;diz monopoly, but runs counter to the strong increase in the
adjusted indices for C&aacute;diz, Sevilla, Cartagena, and Valencia. It
implies that the trading circuit as a whole was distinctly expansive in
the last third of the seventeenth century, although its commerce was redistributed
away from M&aacute;laga.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The chronology of the trend

was a contributing factor.<SUP><A HREF="#N_56_"> (56)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
Wheat output fell considerably in the interior districts of the province

<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></FONT>As
the M&aacute;laga area lost its silk industry and drifted toward agricultural
export and self-sufficiency, the urban network based on Granada lapsed
into economic isolation and a precarious, self-contained stability. Granada's
tax on sugar, an export commodity analogous to wine and raisins in M&aacute;laga,
<B>[240]</SPAN></B> declined sharply, in contrast to the surprising strength
of other exports from M&aacute;laga. From 1635 to the 1670's, this revenue
fell 80% in nominal terms and 87% when adjusted for the price of sugar
(see Table 10.14). The collapse of Spain's domestic sugar industry is clearly
documented, and reflects the presence of colonial sugar in peninsular markets
and reduced domestic buying power. The crises of 1677-85 brought another
drop in production, and in the last decades of the seventeenth century
the yield from the brokerage fee on sugar was less than a tenth of the
figures for the 1630's and '40's. Thus an important link between Granada
and the rest of Spain disappeared.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite the continued decline
of sugar, Granada's population apparently followed the pattern seen in
C&oacute;rdoba. Revenues from the brokerage on wheat are available from
the 1650's through the 1680's, and their stability suggests that any urban
population decline occurred before 1650.<SUP><A HREF="#N_58_"> (58)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
This is also the demographic trend in Ja&eacute;n, Granada's most important
urban satellite, where population fell from 5,596 vecinos in 1594 to about
4,000 around 1650 and then leveled off.<SUP><A HREF="#N_59_"> (59)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
The increasing self-sufficiency of the inland regions is also implied by
the decline of dried fish imports for distribution to the interior. In
contrast to the similar duty in Cartagena, the volume taxed in M&aacute;laga
declined 50% from 1631 to 1670 (see Table 10.15). This again prompts the
inference that even though the population of Granada stabilized after mid-century,
the regional economy was becoming much more isolated and self-contained.</SPAN>

<HR WIDTH="100%">&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The War
of the Spanish Succession and the arrival of the Bourbons on the throne
mark a break in the long-term indicators of port traffic for all three
of the seaports under discussion. The longest unbroken series indicating
port activity is the combined <I>renta mayor y mollages</I> of Cartagena,
supplemented by a <I>renta de la lonja</I> in the last third of the century.
The nominal and adjusted index numbers of these taxes are shown in Table
10.16. The decades after the succession war suggest a slow upward drift
of port activity, extending the recovery of 1675-1700 until the 1740's.
Thereafter, port activity expanded rapidly as the index doubled in the
1740's and redoubled in the 1750's. Even adjusted for inflation, the renta
series shows traffic trebling from 1750 to 1790 and doubling from the end
of the Seven Years' War to 1790. The shorter <I>lonja</I> series shows
similar growth from the mid-1760's and extends the expansion through the
1790's. The trends are remarkably similar to those for both C&aacute;diz
and Barcelona.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The combined tax on cartage
and fish leaving the city (the <I>corredur&iacute;a</I>) also produced
increasing revenue during the eighteenth century, but with a different
chronology (see Table 10.17). After very low yields in 1720-36, it expanded
substantially between 1736 and 1764, but then declined until 1785. Strong
expansion is apparent only at the very end of the 1780's when, adjusted
for prices, the average of the decade was 10% higher than in the 1750's.</SPAN>

<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Apparently the increased
commercial activity in Cartagena was related to the growth of the city
itself and its own hinterland, and revival of the naval base. Agricultural
output in the Murcia region ceased to expand after the <B>[242]</SPAN></B>
middle of the century. The growth of commerce into the more distant interior
is less marked, but can also be explained by decline of the port-of-entry
function because of improved roads in northern Spain and the rise of nearby
Alicante.<SUP><A HREF="#N_60_"> (60)</A></SUP> In any case, well before
1700 Cartagena had begun a century-long commercial expansion that reflected
the development of maritime Spain and Europe and was not associated with
the Spanish interior.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No indicators of port activity
are available for eighteenth-century Valencia, but there is evidence of
a similar trend. Following the recovery of port activity in the late seventeenth
century, the provincial population rose from 255,000 inhabitants in 1718
to 960,000 in 1794. Even though the margin of error inherent in the early
figure is considerable, the growth is spectacular. The city of Valencia
had 75,000 to 100,000 inhabitants by the end of the century and was the
center of an urban network of several towns and ports with 10,000 to 20,000
people. The city produced 2 million <I>varas</I> of silk annually, and
the province exported 420,000 <I>arrobas</I> (5,200 tons) of figs a year
and 330,000 <I>arrobas</I> (4,100 tons) of <I>barilla</I> for the Venetian

oriented to the interior, however, behaved erratically throughout the century.
The lonja fee on inland commerce recovered after the War of Succession,
but remained static from 1711 to 1730. The new version of this tax fluctuated
erratically from 1742 until the 1780's, when imperial trade was reformed

The 1780's saw a substantial increase in the value of general commerce,
although by the end of the century growth had ceased and the real value
of the export tax had declined. Indeed, as in C&aacute;diz and Barcelona,
the mid-1790's mark the beginning of extremely unstable trade conditions

doubled after the succession war, and after 1760 the nominal values indicate
a rapid rise in imports, broken by a recession in the 1780's. When these
figures are adjusted for the price of <I>bacalao</I> in New Castile (assuming

instability in part reflects a boom of coastal trade stimulated by the
Indies reforms which contrasts with conditions in the regional urban network
served by M&aacute;laga. Wheat and sugar brokerage revenues for late eighteenth-century
Granada suggest an expansion of output in the middle decades, but their
later behavior indicates that the urban economy was closely linked to regional
agriculture. There are indications of a downturn in agricultural production

1770's Granada sugar followed suit. The Granada wheat brokerage revenue,
adjusted for Andalusian wheat prices, follows an identical pattern (see
Table 10.20). Thus Granada does not fit any model of Spanish economic growth
involving general or regional expansion in the last third of the eighteenth
century, and its urban economy was unaffected by the commercial boom in

It reputedly produced 300,000 <I>quintales</I> (15,000 tons) of iron a

Basque shipbuilding industry, and the remainder was turned into finished

<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">But despite the wool crisis
and decline of Basque rural industry, one type of commerce remained active
(see Table 10.22). This was the transit trade between the northern ports
and the elite market that was gravitating toward <B>[248]</SPAN></B> Madrid.
At Pancorbo, located on the trade routes reaching Castile through the mountain
passes near Ordufta and Vitoria, toll revenue dropped only 20% between
the 1580's and the 1630's. This is slightly at odds with the timing of
commercial contraction in Bilbao, where <I>consulado</I> revenues reached
their low point in the first quarter of the century and then began to recover
(see Table 10.23). More detailed figures from the <I>Consulado</I> show
that the drop was worst in the crisis of 1626-30.<SUP><A HREF="#N_81_">

rise in <I>Consulado</I> revenues, but a 20% increase in Castilian prices
rendered the gain negligible. Nominal revenues more than doubled from the
second to the third quarter of the century, making it hard to deny an increase
in the real value of trade, whatever the changes in price levels. Revenues
rose another 28% between the third and fourth quarters, and the 17% decline
in prices in Old Castile indicates that the real value of trade may have
grown by a third. The pattern suggests that traffic was sustained by the
growing demand for imports in Madrid and the concentration of Castilian
trade at Bilbao.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By mid-seventeenth century
the structure of Basque commerce had been radically altered. The iron industry
was reduced to ore and rough metal; wool exports had declined and concentrated
at Bilbao, at the expense of Burgos and other northern ports; and the arms
industry, shipbuilding, and fishing had decayed, as foreign merchants took
control of the trading circuit of the Bay of Biscay. Rising <I>Consulado</I>
revenue reflected the revival of wool exports and its concentration in
Bilbao.<SUP><A HREF="#N_82_"> (82)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
But Bilbao now did little but organize wool export <B>[249]</SPAN></B>&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and
pass European imports on to the wealthy elite in Madrid, and these interdependent
trades explain the port's apparent commercial prosperity. As we will see,
by 1650 alternative urban markets in Castile were severely limited.</SPAN>

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As Basque commerce narrowed
its focus, the agricultural hinterland of the littoral withdrew into self-sufficiency,
but in a manner different from that of areas on the south and east coasts.
Coastal population trends show difficulties in the important towns and
manufacturing areas that were most severe in the 1620's. Despite this,
the coastal areas never experienced a true demographic crisis in the seventeenth
century. Expansion of farming land continued, often sacrificing vines and
orchards to provide food grains. But the seventeenth century also saw the
widespread adoption of maize, more intensive farming, fodder crops to maintain
livestock, and rising per-acre yields. This intensified subsistence agriculture,
allied with short-range coastal trade, allowed the northern littoral to
avoid demographic crisis and combine a high level of population with heightened
economic isolation. In 1704, therefore, the population of the coastal districts
was at least as large as it was a century before.<SUP><A HREF="#N_83_">
(83)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> Once away from
the coast, however, we find the same boundary between periphery and interior
that has been noted in Andaluc&iacute;a and M&aacute;laga. While coastal
Vizcaya was adjusting to seventeenth-century conditions with some success,
interior &Aacute;lava, an extension of the Castilian plain, was moving
into a depression before the 1580's and remained depressed and stagnant
until the early eighteenth century.<SUP><A HREF="#N_84_"> (84)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><B>[250]</B> During the eighteenth
century, the Basque economy expanded in many ways, and its commercial life
was recaptured by Basque traders, but the underlying economic structure
of the seventeenth century remained intact. The wool trade grew steadily,
although after the 1750's it was divided between Bilbao and the developing
port of Santander. By 1750 the volume of wool export matched the sixteenth-century
peak and in 1795 was near that level, at 280,000 <I>arrobas</I> (7 million
pounds), despite international instability.<SUP><A HREF="#N_85_"> (85)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
Thereafter, exports declined seriously and did not recover during the first
half of the nineteenth century.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The pattern was similar in
the iron industry, where exports of iron and hardware rose from 20,000
tons in 1733 to 53,000 tons in 1769. Iron ore exports, which had fallen
to 10,000 metric tons in the 1640's, ran about 17,000 metric tons between
1763 and 1790. Subsequently they plummeted for a quarter-century before
starting another recovery in the 1820's.<SUP><A HREF="#N_86_"> (86)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
Basque agriculture underwent further intensive development in the eighteenth
century, achieving large increases in production in the middle decades.
After about 1775 on the coast and 1785 inland, however, production began
to decline. As before, it is important to distinguish between the littoral
and the interior. On the littoral the midcentury increases in output were
on the order of 170-300%, while in the interior they ranged only about
25-100%. During the decline from about 1780 to 1825, the littoral saw a
modest regression of 12-15%, while output in &Aacute;lava fell 40-50%.<SUP><A HREF="#N_87_">
(87)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eighteenth century saw
similar changes all along the northern littoral. Santander became an important
alternative to Bilbao as an outlet for Castilian wool when roads to the
interior improved. This led to new tanning and milling industries in the
hinterland.<SUP><A HREF="#N_88_"> (88)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP>
Many of the agricultural developments seen in the Basque provinces spread
along the coast and could be observed in Santander and Asturias. The trade
in wheat, fish, and other staples that survived the collapse of long-distance
Basque commerce in the preceding century expanded steadily.<SUP><A HREF="#N_89_">
(89)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> This trade circuit
extended from western France to Portugal, allowing regional specialization
and providing maritime sources of supply when local self-sufficiency failed.
Only under extreme conditions did these areas draw on Castile for foodstuffs.<SUP><A HREF="#N_90_">
(90)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The later eighteenth century
saw the development of fishing in Galicia, but it was based on Catal&aacute;n
capital and manpower. As in Vizcaya, Andaluc&iacute;a, and <B>[251]</B>
M&aacute;laga, there was a sharp boundary between littoral and interior
in Galicia, and the interior had a much simpler, less intensive economy.
By the last quarter of the century, large parts of the Galician interior
were oriented to producing cattle for the Madrid stockyards. A contemporary
noted that this trade was one of the few activities that created buying
power for the region, allowing it to participate in the regional markets
of Old Castile and support a modicum of commerce at El Ferrol.<SUP><A HREF="#N_91_">
(91)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SUP> There were attempts
at modernizing the linen industry in Galicia, but marketing problems constantly
plagued the effort.<SUP><A HREF="#N_92_"> (92)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The general impression is
that, excepting the ports of Bilbao and Santander, the northern coast had
very little contact with the interior. The seventeenth-century reconstruction
of the Basque economy had greatly reduced its interaction with Castile
and the north Atlantic, and local Basque economies depended on a combination
of self-sufficiency and coastal trade. The major ports relied on wool exports
and the import of European products for the elite market of the interior--activities
that reinforced the economic structure of the interior and had few links
with their own hinterlands. This reality is reflected in the surprisingly
small size of these commercially important cities.<SUP><A HREF="#N_93_">
(93)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></A></SUP>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><B>III. Conclusion</SPAN></B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Spain's coastal periphery
consisted of a number of economically autonomous regions. In the sixteenth
century, they had varied trajectories; Barcelona and the Valencian coast
were stagnant until the last quarter, while M&aacute;laga and Vizcaya experienced
considerable growth until about 1570, and Sevilla enjoyed a prolonged boom
until after 1610. Barcelona and Vizcaya were in commercial difficulties
by the last decade of the sixteenth century, and Valencia felt them after
1605. Sevilla and Cartagena experienced commercial crisis only in the second
quarter of the seventeenth century, while M&aacute;laga fared relatively
well until the third quarter.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These disparate declines
had certain common features. With the possible exception of Barcelona,
all of the coastal areas experienced a withdrawal of agriculture into increased
self-sufficiency, a process accompanied by a decline of interurban trade.
This trend is even more pronounced within the urban network of the peninsula
as a whole. The interdependence of industry, <B>[252]</B> raw materials,
and markets that had linked Bilbao, Valencia, M&aacute;laga, and Sevilla
with the Castilian interior broke down, and traffic with the interior fell
more rapidly than port activity.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1650 and 1680, all
of these ports except M&aacute;laga passed through a low point in port
activity and began to expand, or at the least had achieved a plateau that
was sustained through the War of Succession. After the war, the eighteenth
century saw striking growth of commercial activity on the coasts. This
phenomenon, in which port activity everywhere in Spain exhibits a similar
chronology, reflected two important developments. One was an apparent but
little-understood upsurge in the volume of private bullion at C&aacute;diz.
While not apparent in official tonnage figures, this lubrication of the
coastal trade circuits signaled a rise in port activity well before 1700
everywhere but M&aacute;laga. To this we must add the boom in Atlantic
commerce after the Restoration in England--which, along with French penetration
of Barcelona and C&aacute;diz, drew Spanish ports into the European market.
This is manifest by the eighteenth century in the importance of agricultural
exports--wool in the north, wine, raisins, olive oil, <I>barilla</I>--to
Europe, coupled with a flow of Catal&aacute;n manufactures to C&aacute;diz
and America.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The striking thing in this
development is that, unlike that of the sixteenth century, there are few
indications that this revival had connections with any aspect of the Castilian
interior other than the consuming market of Madrid and the wool industry.
The reasons for this lie in the fate of the commercial and urban networks
of the interior, as Madrid became a permanent feature of the Castilian
landscape.</SPAN>

the series is based on an ad valorem port duty, it was undoubtedly affected
by prices. The price index is not a very direct reflection of the situation
in Barcelona, and the real trend was probably somewhere between the nominal
and adjusted index numbers. These Barcelona series present a problem which
affects this entire chapter. Some taxes were levied on the quantity of
traffic, some were assessed <I>ad valorem</I>, and some combined both.
To follow actual trends in traffic, tax revenues must be adjusted for inflation
where possible, although the price series are often inadequate. Where possible,
indices will show both nominal change and change adjusted by the nearest
plausible price series. This provides a range of possibilities within which
the actual trend probably existed. Even this has risks, because the <I>ad
valorem</I> tax was probably collected on a mix of commodities different
from that on which the price index was based. There were also occasional
reforms of these minor taxes. Examination of annual municipal accounts
suggests that these are usually reflected in breaks between coherent series.
