        data on drug abuse in the Arab countries are still very scarce. No official 
        reports can be gathered from many Arab countries where drug abuse is prohibited 
        by legal and religious systems. In Egypt, with a population of 65 million 
        inhabitants, drug addiction is considered one of the serious problems 
        that worry both the people and government. It affects young people within 
        their productive years. It may lead to many problems such as social maladaptation, 
        decreased work productivity and job loss <a href="gawad_bottom.html#1" target="bottom">(1</a>,<a href="gawad_bottom.html#2" target="bottom">2)</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Alcohol 
        and Beer were known to Egyptians since the time of the Pharaohs <a href="gawad_bottom.html#3" target="bottom">(3)</a>. During 
        the last century, three major drug outbreaks occurred, the latest was 
        in the mid-eighties, where the spread of heroin constituted a major problem. 
        During that period, an interest for research to monitor the changing pattern 
        of drug addiction in Egypt re-emerged.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The 
        Epidemiological Database</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">A 
        number of projects have been carried out. Abol-Magd <a href="gawad_bottom.html#4" target="bottom">(4)</a> reviewed the changing 
        pattern of drug abuse in a review of all inpatient records over the period 
        from 1972 to 1982. His results demonstrated a significant increase in 
        the number of addicts with a decrease of the mean age of abuse. Abuse 
        was significantly higher among the male married group than in the corresponding 
        female group. Hashish was commonly abused as adjuvant drug prior to the 
        intake of heroin, the main drug of abuse in that sample. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Soueif 
        et al. <a href="gawad_bottom.html#5" target="bottom">(5</a>-<a href="gawad_bottom.html#8" target="bottom">8)</a> conducted a series of national epidemiological studies about 
        the &quot;<i>Ever Used Drug</i>&quot; among technical school students, 
        male secondary school students, male university students, female university 
        students and male workers in the manufacturing industry. Hashish and opiates 
        were the most commonly reported drugs among the above-mentioned five groups. 
        The percentages reported of &quot;Ever Used Hashish&quot; were 9%, 5%, 
        8.5%, 0.05% and 11% respectively while the percentages of &quot;Ever Used 
        Opiates&quot; were 0.0%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.01% and 1% in the above-mentioned 
        five groups respectively.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">In 
        1990, Gawad <a href="gawad_bottom.html#9" target="bottom">(9)</a> reported that the mean age of &quot;Ever Used Drugs &quot;(alcohol, 
        tobacco, cannabis, hallucinogens, sedatives. &amp; tranquilizers, opium, 
        heroin, other opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, antidepressants, other drugs) 
        were 17, 14, 18, 23, 24, 25, 24, 25, 21, 26, 27, 24 years of age respectively. 
        The sample consisted of thirty-nine male inpatients recruited from three 
        different hospitals scattered across Greater Cairo over a period of six 
        months. The progression of their use of drugs started with tobacco, then 
        cannabis, stimulants or alcohol, and then heroin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">A 
        preliminary community report of the Egyptian National Research on Addiction 
        was released in 1996 <a href="gawad_bottom.html#10" target="bottom">(10)</a>. This report was conducted in five governorates 
        out of the twenty-six constituting the Republic of Egypt.<b><i> </i></b>The 
        selected sites were chosen to represent the different social cultures 
        of Egypt. The project involved a stratified sample of both sexes over 
        the age of 16 (N = 16,645). The report addressed the characteristics of 
        those who used substances at least once versus those who did not use psychoactive 
        substance at all. All abused drugs were included except for tobacco. The 
        results presented were only raw figures and percentages rather than statistically 
        significant results. The &quot;Did Not Use&quot; group amounted to 15,588 
        individuals versus the &quot;Used&quot; group involving 1,043, about 15:1. 
        As a whole, the number of positive responses in the community sample is 
        minimal as compared to the claimed lay impression or clinical observations. 
        A caveat is that Cairo, with a population of 16 million, was not included 
        in the study, and it is believed that its inclusion could change the statistical 
        results significantly. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">In 
        1999, the United Nation Drug Control Program (UNDCP) in Egypt carried 
        out a screening project to provide original data collected from drug users 
        and to complement existing survey and research material. They concluded 
        that: the most vulnerable age group lay between ages 15 to 25. Peer pressure 
        was strongly correlated with secondary school abuse. Treatment facilities 
        were not evenly distributed throughout Egypt and, finally, the most recently 
        widespread drug was &quot;Bango&quot; (cannabis derivative). </font></p>

        the Service Needs</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Despite 
        the ever-growing awareness about addiction hazards among the Egyptians, 
        the integration of services and communication both nationally and internationally 
        needs to be developed and improved in order to implement consensual effective 
        comprehensive measures as well as optimal services of whatever modality 
        required and accepted nationally.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Egypt 
        has about a thousand qualified psychiatrists working inside the country. 
        Just a handful of them are trained and specialize in the field of addiction. 
        The major brunt of care falls in the hands of the general psychiatrists. 
        The number of beds assigned for treating addicts is about 600, scattered 
        all over Egypt. About 49% of those beds are served by either the private 
        sector or Non-Governmental Agencies (NGO). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">In 
        2002, the Minister of Health and Population is leading a national reform 
        for health services with special emphasis on developing community-based 
        services. Mental health in general and addiction services in particular 
        are receiving considerable attention in this respect. International consultation 
        was sought and actively contributes to developing and promoting addiction 
        services including the Finnish and the Canadian governments, as well as 
        the WHO and UNDCP.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">ISAM 
        was also introduced to the officials in Egypt as a professional association 
        with expertise in developing a national training and referring system 
        spanning from the primary health care provider to optimal culturally sensitive 
        management options for individuals suffering from drug addiction.</font></p>
