<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>After the <A title="2004 U.S. presidential election" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_U.S._presidential_election">2004 U.S. 
presidential election</A> there were allegations of data irregularities and 
systematic flaws which may have affected the outcome of the presidential and 
local elections. Issues range from allegations of voting machine impropriety to 
complaints voting was not made accessible to all citizens (long lines, 
disenfranchisement). The unofficial result of the election has been publically 
accepted by <A title="John Kerry" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry">John Kerry</A> in favor of <A 
title="George W. Bush" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">George 
W. Bush</A>. However, some groups and individuals (including the <A 
title="Media in the United States" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_in_the_United_States">media</A>, 
independent candidate <A title="Ralph Nader" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader">Ralph Nader</A>, electronic 
voting machine criticism organization <A class=external 
title=http://www.blackboxvoting.org 
href="http://www.blackboxvoting.org/">BlackBoxVoting.ORG</A> <SPAN 
class=urlexpansion>(<I>http://www.blackboxvoting.org</I>)</SPAN>, Kerry's 
brother and legal advisor Cameron Kerry, members of the <A 
title="U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary">House 
Judiciary Committee</A> and citizen blogers) are currently offering their data 
analysis and investigating.</P>
<P>These preliminary data analyses, reports and observations have been made by a 
variety of commentators ranging from computer scientists to voting rights 
organizations. One preliminary analysis from Caltech states "there is no 
evidence, based on exit polls, that electronic voting machines were used to 
steal the 2004 election for President Bush". <A class=external

href="http://vote.caltech.edu/Reports/VotingMachines3.pdf">[1]</A> <SPAN 
class=urlexpansion>(<I>http://vote.caltech.edu/Reports/VotingMachines3.pdf</I>)</SPAN> 
Another preliminary analysis by a PhD at the University of Pennsylvania 
calculates the chance the discrepancy of exit polls vs actual results being due 
to chance is less than 1 in 10<SUP>8</SUP>. <A class=external 
title="http://www.buzzflash.com/alerts/04/11/The unexplained exit poll discrepancy v00k.pdf"

<SPAN 
class=urlexpansion>(<I>http://www.buzzflash.com/alerts/04/11/The_unexplained_exit_poll_discrepancy_v00k.pdf</I>)</SPAN></P>
<P>There were reports of problems with and controversy over electronic and 
optical-scan <A title="Voting machine" 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_machine">voting machines</A>. There 
were also reports of problems relating to abnormally high voter turnout (in some 
precincts, more votes were reported than there were registered voters) and the 
fact the exit poll discrepancies only seemed to show up in swing states. There 
may have been voter access limiting due to long lines at polling locations; 
particularly in high-population areas and in closely contested states. Another 
issue is the perception of a discrepancy between party registration statistics 
and results in some Florida counties. The procedure for counting provisional 
ballots is another controversial issue in many states.</P>

  <LI>The reliability and accuracy of electronic <A title="Voting machine" 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_machine">voting machines</A> has not 
  been established. In some cases they were designed without capability for 
  paper trail or auditability, and cited expert computer scientists state that 
  these machines had a very high potential to be tampered, citing such 
  possibilities as the machines being reprogrammed on election day, fuindamental 
  design flaws, gaps in security logs and the like. The election incident 
  reporting system (<A class=external title=http://www.voterprotect.org 
  href="http://www.voterprotect.org/">EIRS</A> <SPAN 
  class=urlexpansion>(<I>http://www.voterprotect.org</I>)</SPAN>) has recieved 
  many reports from voters and election officials of votes for Kerry being 
  recorded as votes for Bush. In a letter to Bush dated Aug. 14, 2003 Walden 
  O'Dell, the CEO of Diebold (makers of electronic voting machines) wrote that 
  he was "committed to deliver the next election's Electoral Votes to the 
  president next year" <A class=external 
  title=http://www.iht.com/articles/519557.html 
  href="http://www.iht.com/articles/519557.html">[3]</A> <SPAN 
  class=urlexpansion>(<I>http://www.iht.com/articles/519557.html</I>)</SPAN>. 
  This event has further fuelled suspicions of fraud. Electronic voting machines 
  are not generally designed to produce a paper audit trail, if there is a doubt 
  as to whether the machine has accurately represented and counted votes, there 
  may not be a way to independantly verify the election results. <A 
  class=external title=http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,65563,00.html

  class=urlexpansion>(<I>http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,65563,00.html</I>)</SPAN> 
  Because of this, some encourage the use of <A title="Open source" 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open</A>-architecture voting 
  machines. 
  <LI>At least one voting machine began counting back down to zero when it 
  reached 32000 votes; manufacturer ES&amp;S are said to have known about (but 
  not rectified) this issue for two years since the same problem had arisen in a 
  previous mayoral election. (Broward Co., FL) <A class=external

  intimidation, lost ballots, efforts to discredit citizens that may be validly 
  registered. This has the aim of reducing turn out for people believed to 
  support the other side. 
  <LI>Untoward disagreement between exit poll data and actual results, 
  especially in swing states (apparently not matched by similar discrepancies in 
  most non-swing states or other election matters). A Republican pollster called 
  such differences "incredible" adding that exit polls are regarded within his 
  profession as highly accurate. 
  <LI>Disagreement between party affiliation registration statistics for 
  counties and results for that county, especially in swing states. For example, 
  in one Florida county where 77 percent of registered voters are Democrats, 
  Bush received 77 percent of the vote. 
  <LI>Current voting incidents: Over 33,500 incidents reported (minor errors 
  through to large scale direct voter intimidation, mishandled absentee and

  concealed even basic security issues since 2001, and that the ultimate 
  certifying company (Ciber Inc) recommended the machines as passing 
  certification in both of two sample cases, without in fact testing core 
  firmware, and without attempting to verify any of the crucial security aspects 
  of the voting machines. <A title=""

    <DD>Oct. 27, 2004 -- The state of California has ordered that 15,000 brand 
    new touch-screen voting machines not be used in next week's presidential 
    election. These electronic machines were manufactured by Diebold Inc., a 
    North Canton, Ohio-based company that also specializes in automated teller 
    machines and electronic security. </DD></DL></DD></DL>

    happened, but it did," Rapke told ABC News. "There was back up available. 
    But again, with additional familiarity with the system, again, this problem 
    would not have happened." But a former Diebold technical worker, James Dunn, 
    told ABC News the company was aware of the software and electronic problems 
    before the election, and never reported them. "The machine would lock up or 
    lose its software load. A very uncommon thing and not a good thing," said 
    Dunn. "And once that machine's locked up you're unable to produce voter 
    cards, which means you're unable to open the election voting machine and 
    people can't vote. But they shipped it anyway."</EM> </DD></DL></DD></DL>

    <DD>Nov. 12, 2004&nbsp;: <EM>"Computer Science Professor Avi Rubin of John 
    Hopkins University analyzed Diebold's 47,609 lines of code and found it uses 
    an encryption key (56-bit DES) that was hacked in 1997 and no longer is used 
    in secure programs. The Digital Encryption Standard 56-bit encryption key 
    used can be unlocked by a key embedded in all the source code, meaning all 
    Diebold machines would respond to the same key. Rubin said Diebold has said 
    it repaired the security flaws in subsequent programs, but that the company 
    has not produced the code for analysis. Rubin, his graduate students and a 
    colleague from Rice University found other bugs, that the administrator's 
    PIN code was '1111' and that one programmer had inserted, 'This is just a 
    hack for now.' The implication is that by hacking one machine [one] could 
    have access to all Diebold machines. Diebold did return a call for comment."

    <DD>March 5, 2004&nbsp;: <EM>"Harris has also posted a post-mortem [of the 
    2000 election] by CBS detailing how the network managed to call Volusia 
    County for Bush early in the morning. The report states: "Had it not been 
    for these [computer] errors, the CBS News call for Bush at 2:17:52 AM would 
    not have been made." As Harris notes, the 20,000-vote error shifted the 
    momentum of the news reporting and nearly led Gore to concede.</EM> 
  </DD></DL></DD></DL>
<DL>
  <DD>
  <DL>
    <DD><EM>What's particularly troubling, Harris says, is that the errors were 
    caught only because an alert poll monitor noticed Gore's vote count going 
    down through the evening, which of course is impossible. Diebold blamed the 
    bizarre swing on a "faulty memory chip," which Harris claims is simply not 
    credible. The whole episode, she contends, could easily have been 
    consciously programmed by someone with a partisan agenda. Such claims might 
    seem far-fetched, were it not for the fact that a cadre of computer 
    scientists showed a year ago that the software running Diebold's new 
    machines can be hacked with relative ease. The crackers posted some 13,000 
    pages of internal documents on various web sites -- documents that were 
    pounced on by Harris and others. A desperate Diebold went to court to stop 
    this "wholesale reproduction" of company material."</EM> </DD></DL></DD></DL>

    <LI>Gahanna has some 20,000 people elegible to vote and the reported turnout

    vote for Bush, and were therefore presumably Republican, did not appear to 
    vote on <EM>any</EM> other matter bar the Presidency. (These other matters

<P>(3) An analysis reported in the New Zealand press looks at the differences 
between exit polls and reported voting in more detail. It identifies that in a 
selection of non-swing states, the exit polls and final results match. However 
in a large proportion of what were identified before the election as key swing 
states (Wisconsin, Pennysylvania, Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, <EM>etc.</EM>), 
the exit polls and final votes do not match.</P>
<P>The error was in each case a statistically anomalous and electorally critical 
4 - 15% swing (change between exit polls and electronic voting) and furthermore 
the anomalies were not random. In each of the above swing states, this variation 
between what voters said they voted and what the machines reported was in favour 
of Mr. Bush. Source <A class=external

    <DD><EM>...Its a tough question, and it has a lot to do with perception. 
    <STRONG>Of course everyone knows perception is reality...</STRONG></EM> 
    <DD><EM>I've threatened to put a password on the .mdb before when 
    dealers/customers/support have done stupid things with the GEMS database 
    structure using Access. Being able to end-run the database has admittedly 
    got people out of a bind though. Jane (I think it was Jane) did some fancy 
    footwork on the .mdb file in Gaston recently. <STRONG>I know our dealers do 
    it. King County is famous for it. That's why we've never put a password on 
    the file before.</STRONG></EM> 
    <DD><EM>Note however that even if we put a password on the file, it doesn't 
    really prove much. Someone has to know the password, else how would GEMS 
    open it. So this technically brings us back to square one: the audit log is 
    modifiable by that person at least (read, me). Back to perception though, 
    <STRONG>if you don't bring this up you might skate through 
    Metamor.</STRONG></EM> 
    <DD><EM>There might be some clever crypto techniques to make it even harder 
    to change the log ... We're talking big changes here though, and at the 
    moment largely theoretical ones. I'd doubt that any of our competitors are 
    that clever. <STRONG>Bottom line on Metamor is to find out what it is going 
    to take to make them happy. You can try the old standard of the NT password 
    gains access to the operating system</STRONG>, and that after that point all 
    bets are off...</EM> 
    <DD><EM>I sense a loosing battle here though. The changes to put a password 
    on the .mdb file are not trivial and probably not even backward compatible, 
    but we'll do it if that is what it is going to take.</EM> </DD></DL></DD></DL>

<P><BR>Black box voting comment: <EM>Black Box Voting has taken the position 
that fraud took place in the 2004 election through electronic voting machines. 
We base this on hard evidence, documents obtained in public records requests,

voting systems. What we do not know is the specific scope of the fraud. We are 
working now to compile the proof, based not on soft evidence -- red flags, exit 
polls -- but core documents obtained by Black Box Voting in the most massive

Because final published exit polls in America are matched to vote counts, they 
cannot be used to determine election fraud. However, in the 2004 election, 
pre-matched exit polls were leaked onto the internet. The exit poll results of 
one major consortium of news organizations, the National Election Pool ("NEP"), 
were based on interviews with voters in 49 states (omitting <A title=Oregon 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon">Oregon</A> because its system of 
voting by mail eliminated the traditional polling place). The NEP results 
available during the day on Election Day showed Kerry leading Bush. These 
discrepancies led to charges that the exit polls were more accurate than the 
official counts, for various reasons. The co-director of NEP, Warren Mitofsky, 
said he suspected that the difference arose because "the Kerry voters were more 
anxious to participate in our exit polls than the Bush voters." <A

<H3>Misrepresentation of exit poll data</H3>
<P>The following tables compare final exit poll data with penultimate exit poll 
data, note the large swing of support towards Bush, with Kerry losing votes, 
which is impossible if votes are only being added. National Election Pool, the 
consortium which conducts exit polls, has stated that the early data was 
inaccurate due to regulations preventing pollsters from approaching voters, 
legal barriers, and their belief that Democrats are more willing to answer exit 
polls. The consortium dismissed the possibility that their early exit poll was 
accurate and that vote counts were wrong, due to the reasons they provided. The 
early exit poll data was not meant to be released to the public. The data that 
was meant to be released to the public was intended to be weighted by the actual 
vote count. Exit polling companies claim this is standard procedure. Critics 
argue exit poll data should never be <EM>weighted</EM> by final results and have 
requested access to the raw data.</P>

<P>The addition of an extra 57 voters at this station was therefore reported as 
+93 votes for Bush by AP and CNN at least, and voters monitoring the exit polls 
were told authoritatively that Bush had now taken a lead from Kerry.</P>
<P>Note that the counts for Kerry under Male voters changed in a negative 
direction after additional voters were included. The net subtraction of 20 votes 
from the Kerry total after adding new voters seems to reflect an adjustment 
process.</P>

<H2>Vote suppression due to long lines</H2>
<P>Long lines, though seemingly benign, were a problem with the 2004 election. 
In many places, lines were over 6 hours long.</P>
<P>Prior to the election, there was much ado about each precinct getting enough 
ballots. However another serious matter that seems to have been overlooked by 
voter rights activists is whether the precincts had a sufficient number of 
voting machines, so that the votes could be processed at a sufficient rate. 
Machine quantity as well as ballot quantity determines the saturation point of 
votes. Number of machines * Max. votes per hour per machine * hours poll is open 
= max. number of votes precinct is able to process. Every voter over this limit 
is effectively disenfranchised, just as if the precint had run out of ballots; 
the precinct runs out of voter-time-slots. Most polling places stayed open to 
accommodate all voters who were in line as of the official closing time, but 
voters still had to wait for hours before they could cast their vote, and many 
left because of the wait.</P>
<P>Although low population precincts had relatively plenty of voting machines 
and were well within the limits of processing capacity, high-population centers 
often did not, and sometimes had less than half the machines requested and were 
well outside the limits of processing capacity, effectively disenfranchising an 
undetermined number of voters.</P>
<P>This may explain the discrepancy between expected voter turnout in 
high-population areas and counted voter turnout in these areas. Since 
high-population areas are predominantly Democratic, this would primarily affect 
the Democratic constituency, and appear on the surface to reflect inefficacy in 
the Democratic get-out-the-vote effort.</P>

  testimony about Election Day voter suppression and irregularities that they 
  believe are threatening democracy. The hearing, sponsored by the Election 
  Protection Coalition, was to collect testimony of voting troubles that might 
  be used to seek legislative changes to Ohio's election process. The organizers 
  chose Ohio because it was a swing state in the presidential election as well 
  as the site of numerous claims of election fraud and voter disenfranchisement.

  "irregularities in the vote reported on the AccuVote Diebold Machines in

  "These irregularities favor President George W. Bush by 5 percent to 15

  As one of the candidates on the ballot, Nader has the right to demand a 
  recount, but is required to pay for it (because he lost by more than 1 percent 
  of the vote). The state Attorney General's office initially responded that 
  Nader's request was not valid because, although the request was submitted by 
  the deadline, it was not accompanied by a check for the expenses. <A

<P>Press comment by International Monitors:</P>
<DL>
  <DD><EM>"International monitors at a polling station in southern Florida said 
  Tuesday that voting procedures fell short in many ways of the best global 
  practices. The observers said they had less access to polls than in 
  Kazakhstan, that the electronic voting had fewer fail-safes than in Venezuela, 
  that the ballots were not so simple as in the Republic of Georgia and that no 
  other country had such a complex national election system. Two-member observer 
  teams fanned out across 11 states and included citizens of 36 countries, 
  ranging from Canada and Switzerland to Latvia, Kyrgyzstan, Slovenia and 
  Belarus."</EM> </DD></DL>
<DL>
  <DD><EM>As for electronic voting, Gould said he preferred Venezuela's system 
  to the calculator-sized touch pads in Miami. "Each electronic vote in 
  Venezuela also produces a ticket that voters then drop into a ballot box," 
  Gould said. "Unlike fully electronic systems, this gives a backup that can be 
  used to counter claims of massive fraud." The United States is also nearly 
  unique in lacking a unified voter registration system or national identity 
  card, Gould said, adding that he would ideally require U.S. voters to dip a 
  finger in an ink bowl or have a cuticle stained black after voting. "In El 
  Salvador, Namibia and so many other elections, the ink was extremely important 
  in preventing challenges to multiple voting," Gould said. "In Afghanistan it 
  didn't work so well, because they used the dipping ink for the cuticles, so it 
  wiped right off."</EM> </DD></DL>
