    <strong><em>Un Vestibule &eacute;clatant: </em>The Prologue to Lully and Quinault's 
    <em>Atys </em><br>
    Geoffrey Burgess<br>
    </strong> </font></div>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Until 
    recently, little attention has been paid to the prologues of the <i>trag&eacute;die 
    en musique.</i>&nbsp; Older scholars such as P.-M. Masson, E. Gros and C. 
    Girdlestone considered that, as their primary function was to praise France's 
    <i>h&eacute;ros glorieux,</i> the prologues were largely formulaic and lacked 
    originality, and furthermore because they did not contribute to the central 
    narrative of the opera, they were of minimal dramatic interest. But praise 
    of the<i> roi soleil</i> was not the prologue's only function. The prologues 
    of Lully's fourteen <i>trag&eacute;dies</i> en musique develop a number of 
    strategies to introduce the subject of the ensuing tragedy, and several also 
    outline how the subject will be treated. A comparison with the front matter 
    of a literary work is germane. Like a literary preface that introduces the 
    work of which it is also a part, the operatic prologue occupied a liminal 
    position, at once part of the operatic performance and a space where its content 
    could be elucidated. It served both as dedication and as an occasion for the 
    author to address prefatory remarks directly to the audience. In Marmontel's 
    image, it was a vestibule leading from the social reality of the present to 
    the mythico-fabulous realm of the trag&eacute;die.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper considers some of these aspects of the 
    prologue to <i>Atys</i> (1676).&nbsp; I argue that this prologue's central 
    theme allegorizes Quinault's and Lully's response to the criticisms leveled 
    against <i>Alceste</i> and as such constitutes an authorial statement on the 
    genre's characteristics at a crucial point in its development.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to considering the historical significance 
    of the <i>Atys</i> prologue, the paper discusses the production conceived 
    by Jean-Marie Vill&eacute;gier and Les Arts Florissants (1987&#8211;91). Despite 
    the status that this production has accrued as a milestone in the revival 
    of French Baroque opera, the staging of the prologue was criticized for the 
    liberties it took with the text and above all the comic tone it superimposed 
    on the original text. Rather than as an irreverent post-modern take on the 
    platitudes of eulogy, I interpret Vill&eacute;gier's staging as an informed 
    reading of this prologue that reinforces its function as authorial preface.<br>

    <strong>Human Work with Divine Material: <br>
    A Work Concept in the Theory of Christoph Bernhard</strong> <br>
    <strong>Keith Chapin</strong><br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia,Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the first 
    chapter of the <em>Tractatus compositionis augmentatus,</em> Bernhard drew 
    upon the four Aristotelian causes to position the poetics of composition between 
    heavenly sounds and human artifice. The composer (the efficient cause) used 
    consonances and dissonances (the material) in alternation and in combination 
    (the form) to create harmony, please the listener, and make himself famous 
    (the final cause). The four causes allowed Bernhard to synthesize sacred and 
    secular ideals of creativity. If the material of rational intervals was a 
    heavenly gift, the composer could create a work that gave him worldly fame.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by Braun and von Loesch, seventeenth-century 
    German theorists often invoked the Aristotelian <em>materia</em> and <em>forma</em> 
    in Lutheran guises, though they applied the terms to varying phenomena; and, 
    as argued by Blackburn, Cahn, von Loesch, and Seidel, Renaissance theorists 
    frequently borrowed the concept of the poetic work from classical rhetoric. 
    Bernhard fused the traditions in a manner appropriate to seventeenth-century 
    German compositional technique. The composer improved upon theologically significant 
    intervals through the artful science of counterpoint. To maintain the speculative 
    aura of the interval, counterpoint tightly regulated or "formed" the consonances 
    and dissonances. At the same time, counterpoint allowed composers to develop 
    their own subjects or inventions, as well as to engage in the "ornaments" 
    of composition, in particular fugue. The "work," then, was a piece of human 
    artifice that formed divine material.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In its technical details and its mixture of sacred and 
    secular principles, Bernhard's concept of the work was appropriate to the 
    North-German interest in and style of linear counterpoint. It resonated strongly 
    in Birnbaum's defense of Bach. However, it differed profoundly from that of 
    Romantic aesthetics, described by Dahlhaus and Goehr, while its technical 
    realization opposed the emphasis on form and melody of the late eighteenth 
    and nineteenth centuries. By offering an alternative, Bernhard allows us both 
    to differentiate notions of the musical work and to understand their necessary 
    rapport with specific compositional styles and techniques.</font></p>

    <strong>&#8220;The Cries of Nature in Mourning&#8221;: <br>
    Temporality and Aesthetics in Marais's Elegy for Lully</strong><br>
    <strong>Jonathan Gibson</strong><br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Georgia,Times New Roman, Times, serif">French Baroque 
    music falls less pleasingly on many modern ears than that from Germany and 
    Italy. Listeners often perceive French works as failing to induce in the auditor 
    a sense of anticipation, and consequently, as lacking direction and momentum.&nbsp; 
    I propose that such perceptions are closely related to the singularity of 
    French musical aesthetics, particularly as manifested in notions of temporality.&nbsp; 
    Composers in France strove to imitate the visible and audible effects of agitated 
    passions on human behavior.&nbsp; Likewise, their music frequently engenders 
    a temporal flow that strives to duplicate the human experience of time.&nbsp; 
    Since human beings cannot accurately discern future events until they occur, 
    composers often approximated this "human temporality" by de-emphasizing predictable 
    structures and formal conventions.&nbsp; By doing so, composers consciously 
    induced in the listener two interrelated effects: an extreme consciousness 
    of the present moment and a blindness to what lies ahead.&nbsp; Both of these 
    results run counter to qualities of forward motion and anticipation we esteem 
    in Bach and Mozart, and are bound to make many modern listeners uneasy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guided by principles expressed in late seventeenth-century 
    sources, I approach the problem of temporality in French music by regarding 
    purely formal concerns as subservient to an aesthetic focus on the signified 
    object of impassioned human behavior. The significance of this approach is 
    revealed through my reading of Marin Marais's <i>Tombeau pour Mr de Lully.</i> 
    In particular, I consider one of the <em>Tombeau's</em> moments as an indecorous, 
    corporeal breakdown in the face of overwhelming passions.&nbsp; When, aided 
    by an understanding of "human temporality," we compare that moment with a 
    similar-sounding passage in the work&#8217;s final measures, it becomes clear 
    that motivic resonances within this<em> tombeau</em> are not primarily devices 
    serving to foster a sense of formal cohesion, but crucial semiotic constructions 
    that hold the keys to interpreting Marais&#8217;s potent elegy.<br>

    <strong>From Saint to Music: Saint Cecilia in Florence <br>
    Barbara R. Hanning</strong><br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia,Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Saint Cecilia&#8217;s iconic 
    status as patron saint of music is universal, although she is principally 
    associated with Rome, where her basilica was founded in the fifth century.&nbsp; 
    The revival of her cult in the seventeenth century resulted in renewed interest 
    on the part of poets, musicians, and painters, many of whom were in the Roman 
    orbit.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing her legend (based on the thirteenth-century 
    <em>Golden Legend</em> and scenes from her life depicted in the early fourteenth 
    century) and describing her relationship to music (using Thomas Connelly&#8217;s 
    study, <i>Mourning into Joy,</i> 1994) this paper explores some little-known 
    connections between Saint Cecilia and Florence, where a new musical academy 
    adopted her as patron in 1607.&nbsp; Under Medici rule, Florence was dominated 
    by male saints; but with the renewed interest in the cult of Cecilia, her 
    image began to proliferate among Florentine artists (Artemisia Gentileschi 
    and Carlo Dolci) and specifically for female Medici patrons (the archduchesses 
    Maria Maddalena and Vittoria della Rovere).&nbsp; Moreover, the paper highlights 
    a special connection between Saint Cecilia and a young Florentine virtuosa 
    singer, Arcangela Paladini (d. 1622), who may have been the model for one 
    of Artemisia's paintings of the virgin martyr. Finally, through the examination 
    of these representations and verbal descriptions, the paper traces Cecilia's 
    transformation from virgin-in-ecstasy (established principally by Raphael's 
    1515 painting) to the allegorical figure (celebrated by seventeenth-century 
    artists) of La Musica herself&#8212;from exalted saint to inspirational muse.</font></p>

    <em><strong>Stile recitativo</strong></em><strong> as Adequate Interpretation 
    and Fixed Orality:<br>
    A Rhetorical Approach to a Musical Style<br>
    Jette Barnholdt Hansen<br>
    </strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia,Times New Roman, Times, serif">Recitative 
    style&#8212;beyond dispute the <i>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i> of the first 
    <i>favole musicali</i>&#8212;is often linked to discussions within the Italian 
    academies about the theory of ancient Greek music and Greek tragedy.&nbsp; 
    But elaborating their expressive monodic music, composers such as Peri, Caccini 
    and Monteverdi also received great help and inspiration from the rhetorical 
    tradition of the academic culture in the late Renaissance as a whole.&nbsp; 
    The Italian <i>nobili</i> were experienced rhetoricians with a codex of practical 
    and perceptive skills gained both through a theoretical study of rhetorical 
    theory and through regular participation in a forum of dialogue, either as 
    performers or listeners. This varied oral practice&#8212;which included speaking, 
    reciting, arguing, singing, etc. &#8212;meets with an increasingly literary 
    tradition and logocentric perception around 1600 intensified by the extension 
    of printed scores.&nbsp; <i>Stile recitativo</i> can be seen as a result of 
    this dynamic interaction, whose consequences are to be observed in the composers&#8217; 
    self-perceptions, in the way of writing down vocal music, and in the ensuing 
    demands of the notation to the performing singer. Eventually, it results in 
    a paradox of the musical style: because of the intensified literacy, the notation 
    becomes an impression of immanent orality&#8212;of the self-conscious composer&#8217;s 
    rhetorical delivery, adequate interpretation, and voice.<br>

    <strong>Public Mourning and Prohibitions against Music<br>
    In Seventeenth-Century Germany<br>
    Gregory S. Johnston</strong><br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia,Times New Roman, Times, serif">Income derived 
    from participation at funerals was of fundamental importance to the livelihood 
    of German musicians in the seventeenth century.&nbsp; The significance of 
    this income is still evident in J. S. Bach&#8217;s well-known petition sent 
    to the Imperial Russian Agent at Danzig, Georg Erdmann, in 1730.&nbsp; In 
    it the Thomaskantor states: "My present post amounts to 700 <em>thaler,</em> 
    and when there are rather more funerals than usual, the fee rises in proportion; 
    but when a healthy wind blows they fall accordingly, as for example last year, 
    when I lost fees that would ordinarily come in from funerals to an amount 
    of more than 100 <em>thaler</em>."&nbsp; Indeed, funerals occasioned commissions 
    for new works by composers, provided essential supplements to the incomes 
    of cantors and other school instructors who supervised performances of processional 
    and ceremonial music, and augmented the meager income of needy pupils from 
    the church schools.&nbsp; This aspect of professionalism has received attention 
    from scholars working in the area, but a related and equally important facet 
    of funerary culture in early-modern Germany has been largely overlooked.&nbsp; 
    When a member of the ruling nobility died, public mourning was customarily 
    invoked by the court, during which time many types of private and public music-making 
    were strictly forbidden.&nbsp; Because these periods of public mourning could 
    extend anywhere from two months to more than a year in length, the consequences 
    for civic and church musicians were particularly severe.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present paper is an inquiry into some of the implications 
    and ramifications of invoked bans on music. More than just the imposition 
    of silence on a region, periods of public mourning were also the catalyst 
    for various musical activities. Courts saw them as opportunities to "lend" 
    and "borrow" musicians (e.g., Praetorius and Sch&uuml;tz), whereas town and 
    church councils affected by these prohibitions found themselves faced with 
    the risk of permanently losing their best and most employable musicians. An 
    awareness of these bans may contribute, moreover, to a better understanding 
    of patterns and tendencies in the creative activities of contemporary composers.<br>

    <strong><em>Gl'inganni amorosi scoperti in villa </em>(1696): A Comic Opera<br>
    in Bolognese Dialect during the Early Period of Arcadian Reform<br>
    James Leve</strong><br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia,Times New Roman, Times, serif">Around 1680 
    writers in Bologna began to develop an indigenous comic opera repertory in 
    dialect. They devised unusually complex plots that unify rustic and urban 
    comedy. One such work, Lelio Maria Landi's <i>Gl'inganni amorosi scoperti 
    in villa,</i> has a sprawling plot that unfolds in the country and centers 
    on three interlocking love triangles, rather than on standard two of mainstream 
    opera. In addition to the dramaturgic complexity, the lovers <i>(innamorati)</i> 
    and some of the city dwellers <i>(cittadini)</i> speak Italian, while the 
    rustic characters <i>(contadini)</i> and the Doctor speak Bolognese. By contrast, 
    Florentine writer, influenced by Arcadian sentiments, eschewed rustic comedy 
    and dialect, preferring urban settings and linguistic purity. Impervious to 
    Arcadian reform, Bolognese writers such as Landi were not overly concerned 
    with dramatic unity and linguistic purity, as they based their comic operas 
    more on live performance than on literary dramatic traditions, as was the 
    case in Florence and Rome. As <em>Gl'inganni amorosi</em> reveals, the influence 
    of live performance insured a degree of theatrical realism unheard of in Florentine 
    and Roman comic opera. As the Bolognese saw it, comedy was tied to local customs 
    and, therefore, to the way people actually spoke and behaved.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal of dialect comedy in Bologna is connected 
    to the inherent tension between the spoken language (Bolognese) and official 
    written language (Florentine). Furthermore, the Bolognese aristocracy, contadini, 
    and educated and servant classes spoke different registers of the local dialect. 
    Landi's <i>Gl'inganni amorosi</i> echoed the indigenous bilingual soundscape 
    of Bologna. Humor would have arisen from the clash of the coarse dialect of 
    the <i>contadini,</i> the higher register of the Doctor, and the stylized 
    Florentine of the serious <i>innamorati.</i> The seeming incongruity would 
    have appeared natural to the local audience, for whom moving between spoken 
    dialect and written Florentine was a political and social reality.<br>

      Pereira and the <em>L&uuml;-l&uuml; Zhengyi:</em><br>
      Trans-Cultural Exchange in the Chinese Court<br>
      Joyce Lindorff</strong></strong><br>
      </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">A 
      Portuguese Jesuit missionary, Tom&aacute;s Pereira (1645-1708) was invited 
      to Beijing by the Emperor Kangxi in 1672 because of his accomplishment in 
      music, mathematics, and diplomacy. Jesuit records and Pereira's correspondence 
      attest to the multitude of skills he employed during his thirty-six-year 
      residence in China. In addition to serving as music master to the emperor, 
      composing Chinese hymns, and building several organs in Beijing, at Kangxi's 
      request Pereira was instrumental in negotiating the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk 
      between Russia and China, the first such agreement between Asia and Europe. 
      But it was his work as music theorist that produced a far-reaching cultural 
      exchange. At his first appearance before Kangxi, Pereira astounded him with 
      a demonstration of western musical notation, repeating Chinese melodies 
      flawlessly after one hearing. This inspired Kangxi to create a Music Academy 
      to write about and reform ancient Chinese music and instruments; he ordered 
      those with ability, including one of his sons, to study music. The academy 
      ultimately produced the four-volume <i>L&uuml;-l&uuml; Zhengyi (The True 
      Doctrine of Music),</i> which became an important treatise on Chinese music 
      theory. A fifth volume on Western music theory was begun by Pereira; after 
      his death it was completed by Teodorico Pedrini, his successor as court 
      musician. The presence of a western music treatise within the context of 
      a Chinese theoretical study embodies a unique east-west collaboration. While 
      the contents of the western volume provide documentary evidence of the transmittal 
      of western music theory to China by the late seventeenth century, the <i>L&uuml;-l&uuml; 
      Zhengyi</i> owes its very existence to the musical and theoretical exchange 
      between Pereira and Kangxi.</font></p>

    <strong>Alchemy, Androgyny, and Music:<br>
    A Rare Fusion in the Seventeenth Century<br>
    Eva Linfield</strong><br>
    </font></div>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Michael 
      Maier (1568&#8211;1622) published his well-known emblematic treatise <i>Atalanta 
      fugiens</i> in 1617. It contains fifty copper-plate emblems, along with 
      the same number of epigrammatical poems which, in turn, are set to music 
      in fifty fugues. He had been a medical doctor, alchemist, and philosopher 
      at the Habsburg court of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague.&nbsp;After the death 
      of Rudolph, he moved north, and Moritz, Landgraf von Hessen, engaged Maier 
      in 1616 at the court in Kassel. Moritz, also called "the Learned," was himself 
      interested in alchemistic mysticism and was as a composer and connoisseur 
      closely involved with music.&nbsp; He had fostered the young Heinrich Sch&uuml;tz 
      and employed him as his<em> Kapellmeister</em> just before losing him for 
      good in 1617 to the court of Saxony. Sch&uuml;tz and Maier must have briefly 
      overlapped at the court in Kassel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maier's connection of alchemy with music is rare. 
      Even more striking is the number of androgynous images that express the 
      fundamental alchemic rule: "The One is the Whole, and the Whole is the One."&nbsp; 
      For example, Maier used an Ovidian myth as musical parable: Atalanta's fugal 
      melody&#8212;she tries to flee from her lover Hippomenes&#8212;alludes to 
      the idea of "two in one" and represents the female, mercurial principle 
      that requires balancing with the masculine sulphuric principle.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This paper will trace these concepts of androgyny 
      and show their practical infiltration into areas of seventeenth-century 
      composition. Although Maier treats music as still belonging to the quadrivium, 
      the four mathematical arts, with his compositions exhibiting an archaic 
      style, I shall consider androgyny more broadly as a concept that influenced 
      practical seventeenth-century compositional techniques, documenting this 
      trend with examples mostly from Sch&uuml;tz's music.&nbsp; Among my points 
      of investigation will be, to mention just one technique, tonal mutation 
      with <em>durus/mollis</em> opposites. Maier's <i>Atalanta fugiens</i> will 
      serve then as a starting point for my musical analysis.<br>

    <strong>Making Opera English: John Dennis's <em>Rinaldo and Armida</em> (1698)<br>
    Kathryn Lowerre</strong><br>
    </font></p>
  <div align="left">
    <p><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the turn 
      of the eighteenth century, English operas, or "dramatick operas," differed 
      from continental all-sung operas, featuring actors in the principal roles, 
      who spoke their dialogue, alternating with elaborate musical interludes 
      performed by a separate cast of singers and musicians. This hybrid form 
      was explained by contemporary commentators as due to the English antipathy 
      to all-sung productions, reflecting the peculiarly English conviction that 
      there were suitable places in drama for music and also places in which it 
      should not appear.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his critical works, Dennis argues that the English 
      have a particularly strong need for dramatic entertainments&#8212;as long 
      as they are of the proper kind.&nbsp; On the stage, Music, Dennis tells 
      us, must always be made subservient to Reason.&nbsp; Structurally, <em>Rinaldo 
      and Armida</em> consists of a series of scenes demonstrating the powers 
      of music to move the passions; while the seductive or frightening music 
      performed by Armida&#8217;s spirits may temporarily discomfit the hero or 
      his friends, celestial or martial music and action always (eventually) counters 
      it.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the prologue to his dramatick opera, <i>Rinaldo 
      and Armida</i> (music by John Eccles), John Dennis makes explicit the revisioning 
      he has done in bringing Tasso's story to the London stage. The "errors" 
      in the Italian representation of the irresolute hero, and the "soft bewitchments" 
      of the French <i>Armide</i> (libretto by Quinault, music by Lully, 1686) 
      have been corrected. Yet Dennis also praises and imitates aspects of both 
      continental opera traditions. Far from the virulent reactionary stance of 
      his infamous 1706 essay on opera, Dennis's work in <i>Rinaldo and Armida</i> 
      reflects an awareness and appreciation of French and Italian attempts to 
      combine music and drama, and his own interest in making opera English.</font></p>

    <strong>Time Suspended: The Unmeasured Prelude as a Dissolving Emblem<br>
    Vivian Montgomery, Harpsichord</strong><br>
    </font></div>
  <p alignh = "left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
    today's harpsichordists, the seventeenth-century <i>pr&eacute;lude non mesur&eacute;e</i> 
    poses the greatest challenge to internalize, and subsequently evoke in performance, 
    a nearly ineffable French aesthetic. Susan McClary traces an element of timelessness, 
    or "bittersweet inconclusiveness" in the intricate harpsichord language of 
    D&#8217;Anglebert, employing a parallel with art historian Michael Fried&#8217;s 
    concept of "absorption" embodied in the human figures painted by Greuze and 
    others.&nbsp; In turn, I&#8217;ve been inspired by both writers to explore 
    parallels between painting and preluding in an attempt to arrive at a fuller 
    characterization of the timeless, distracted atmosphere abiding in the preludes 
    of Louis Couperin, D&#8217;Anglebert, and Jacquet de La Guerre.&nbsp; Unlike 
    the tombeaux analyzed by McClary, the preludes of these composers communicate 
    their nature via the visually evocative, almost pictorial vehicle of meterless 
    and rhythmless notation, linking the pieces more naturally to painting and 
    its accompanying philosophical discourse.&nbsp; In widening the cultural and 
    aesthetic lens through which I regard the milieu of the prelude, a deeper 
    sense of the timeless sensibilities they embody surfaces.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hands of Louis Couperin, the prelude was brought 
    to a new plane of harpsichordistic refinement and complexity. His style of 
    preluding was influenced by Froberger's 1652 stay in Paris, this contact serving 
    as a conduit by which the semi-improvised toccata could seep into the compositional 
    consciousness of a pivotal French harpsichord master and take form in what 
    Couperin must have perceived as an appropriate, indeed liberating, type of 
    notation.&nbsp; In the last three decades of the seventeenth century and the 
    earliest years of the eighteenth century, notation became an increasingly 
    restrictive, fabricated packaging for this form of expression.&nbsp; Quirky, 
    and often ineffectual, innovations in unmeasured notation are a compromising 
    effort to clarify to amateur outsiders a style of composition/performance 
    whose insular mysteries had drawn attention.&nbsp; Composers and scribes whose 
    work it was to deliver, through publication, a decipherable representation 
    to an increasingly far-flung market would likely claim to be preserving the 
    essence of Couperin&#8217;s unmeasured ambience in their detailed and prescriptive 
    notation.&nbsp; By examining and playing works representing the spectrum from 
    free notation to more specified renderings, I will follow a process of discovery 
    as to how much preservation is possible when the most potent signifier of 
    timelessness, fully undifferentiated notation, is compromised or removed altogether.&nbsp; 
    Application of stratified, differentiated notation by LeBegue (1677) and D&#8217;Anglebert 
    (1689), followed ultimately by fully measured notation by Dandrieu (1705) 
    and Fran&ccedil;ois Couperin (1716) gradually sounded a death knell for the 
    musical genre while also pointing to larger institutional trends, in the time 
    of Louis XIV, toward controlling and exploitatively reshaping individualistic 
    and free forms of expression.<br>

    <strong>Early Seventeenth-Century Dance Figures:<br>
    &#8220;Moving Script&#8221; in English and French Court Festivals<br>
    Jennifer Nevile</strong><br>
    </font></div>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
    has long been recognized that geometric figures played an important role in 
    the choreographies of early seventeenth-century English and French court festivals.&nbsp; 
    But why did geometric figures assume such a dominant part of court theatrical 
    dance at this time?&nbsp; Geometric shapes were found in dances of previous 
    centuries, but it was only in the early 1600s that dance began to be seen 
    as a language of symbols, patterns, and geometric figures, a form of "moving 
    writing" or "moving script" that was created by the physical bodies of the 
    dancers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper explores the reasons why these geometric 
    figures assumed such a dominant role in English and French court theatrical 
    dance in the early seventeenth century. Given the impact of John Dee's Preface 
    to Henry Billingsley's 1570 translation of Euclid, and Dee's emphasis on Alberti's 
    idea of an architect, I hypothesize that the English choreographers saw themselves 
    in a similar manner, as architects responsible for the design of the dance 
    in geometric and proportional terms. For these choreographers the true beauty 
    of their dances resided in the geometric figures, rather than in the "material 
    stuff" of which the dances were composed: step sequences, or individual steps 
    or movements. It was the choreographers who were the possessors of<em> ingenio:</em> 
    they were responsible for the planning and design of dances that were built 
    on the cosmic beauty of geometry. This paper ends with a question. Given that 
    dance was viewed as "moving writing," did this perspective influence the development 
    of an actual dance script in the later decades of the seventeenth century?<br>

  <p align = "left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
    Lully assumed the directorship of the Acad&eacute;mie Royale de Musique in 
    1672, he was granted a series of restrictions limiting the number of singers, 
    instrumentalists, and dancers permitted in public theaters other than his 
    own.&nbsp; For the next decade, Moli&egrave;re&#8217;s former company circumvented 
    these limitations and continued to include music, dance, and spectacle in 
    its productions.&nbsp; So far, however, little attention has been given to 
    the musical performance practices of this company during the latter seventeenth 
    century.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The autograph manuscripts of Marc-Antoine Charpentier 
    include music for some fifteen dramatic productions given during 1672&#8211;85.&nbsp; 
    These scores reveal a wealth of details concerning the performance of instrumental 
    music, vocal solo and choral music, and dances within the context of primarily 
    spoken drama.&nbsp; They confirm that on many occasions more singers and instrumentalists 
    appeared on-stage than the permitted two singers and six instrumentalists, 
    and that dance movements continued to figure in Charpentier&#8217;s scores 
    long after the use of dancers was forbidden.&nbsp; Composed for an established 
    ensemble of vocalists and instrumentalists&#8212;and often performed under 
    the composer&#8217;s personal direction&#8212;this theater music features 
    diverse instrumental and vocal forms and styles.&nbsp; Some of the issues 
    to be addressed in this paper are: (1) the association of purely instrumental 
    music to the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne; (2) instrumentation and orchestral doublings; 
    (3) continuo practices in vocal, choral, and instrumental music; (4) technical 
    demands of vocal roles, as performed by singing actors; (5) dance practices 
    in orchestrally-accompanied choral music; and (6) the relationship between 
    meter, tempo, and affective indication.<br>

      Johannes Kepler, Andreas Werckmeister, and the Divine Proportion<br>
      Tushaar Power </strong></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
  </div>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
    paper advocates the premise that knowledge of the proportion of the Golden 
    Section was available to musical circles in seventeenth-century Germany, where 
    it was known at the time as the "Divine Proportion."&nbsp; It will be shown 
    that in one specific instance the thesis that a musical composition should 
    be organized around this singular proportion had been formulated and published 
    by the end of the seventeenth century.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voluminous writings of the German music 
    theorist Andreas Werckmeister (1645-1706), contain probative material.&nbsp; 
    Once his garbled ramblings have been read in their entirety, an idiosyncratic 
    thesis emerges.&nbsp; Werckmeister&#8217;s "thesis" holds that: "God has ordained 
    all things by number, weight and measure;" that there is a specific and singular 
    proportional system undergirding Creation; that the Bible directs man to fashion 
    his creations following this "natural order"; hence a musical composition 
    should be organized around this "divine order."&nbsp; Each element of Werckmeister&#8217;s 
    thesis will be illustrated with appropriate quotation from his writings.&nbsp; 
    Werckmeister cites both Biblical texts and Johannes Kepler's Harmonices mundi 
    of 1619, and I shall quote the appropriate passages from these sources.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unprovable certainty that Werckmeister's thesis 
    was transmitted, directly or indirectly, is considered. It is demonstrable 
    that many, including Buxtehude, Kuhnau, J. G. Walther, J. S. Bach and Mizler, 
    valued Werckmeister's writings.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three conclusions are proffered.&nbsp; Firstly, it 
    is documentable that knowledge of the Divine Proportion, via Kepler's <i>Harmonices 
    mundi,</i> existed in at least one musical circle in late seventeenth- (and 
    early eighteenth-) century Germany.&nbsp; Secondly, the concept that a musical 
    composition should incorporate the Divine Proportion in its organization had 
    been formulated by Werckmeister and disseminated within a circle where his 
    works were accorded authority.&nbsp; Thirdly, given the tenets of strict seventeenth-century 
    Lutheran orthodoxy within which both Kepler&#8217;s and Werckmeister&#8217;s 
    philosophies resided, it follows that if a composer were to have applied Werckmeister&#8217;s 
    thesis when designing a piece of music, this practice would have been in complete 
    harmony with principles of Lutheran piety, fidelity, and worship: a "subordination 
    to a higher order."<br>

    <em><strong>&#8220;Musique grotesque,&#8221; Ballet de cour,</strong></em><strong>

    </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"></div> </font>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
    term "grotesque" carries a trail of associations in current usage, bringing 
    to mind images of misshapen fantastical creatures or "misshapen sounds" like 
    the "howlings" and "groans" from Hector Berlioz&#8217;s vision of a witches&#8217; 
    sabbath in <i>Symphonie fantastique.</i>&nbsp; Its relevance to nineteenth-century 
    studies and modernist art has been widely explored by art historians, literary 
    scholars, and musicologists.&nbsp; In the realm of seventeenth-century studies, 
    the possibility of a musical "grotesque," especially with respect to French 
    music, has garnered little scholarly attention, while for most literary theorists 
    the seventeenth century marks the decline of the utopian grotesque celebrated 
    by Mikhail Bakhtin in<em> Rabelais and his World.</em><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the term "grotesque" occurs in several of 
    the court ballets produced during the reign of Louis XIV, a period often viewed 
    as unrelentingly majestic and formal. Instances of "musique grotesque" occur 
    in at least four ballets&#8212;<i>Festes de Bacchus</i> (1651), <i>Bienvenus</i> 
    (1655), <i>Impatience</i> (1661), and <i>Mariage forc&eacute;</i> (1664). 
    In each instance, the "musique grotesque" is situated as either foreign&#8212;namely, 
    Italian&#8212;or rustic, not of the French courtly world, nor of urban Paris. 
    Surviving music for these scenes indicates that foreigners and class helped 
    to define the musical grotesque on the court ballet stage. Goal-directed harmonies, 
    regular four-bar phrases, and motivic relationships mark these pieces as strikingly 
    different from the surrounding French dance music, with its characteristic 
    irregular phrases, and harmonic progressions that tend not to direct the ear 
    decisively to a tonic pitch. This usage of musique grotesque, setting up Italianate 
    musical style as ridiculous, suggests that, at least in the court ballets, 
    the grotesque still had both a place and a function in the mid-seventeenth 
    century. If no longer a utopian celebration of openness, the grotesque represented 
    an attempt to stabilize the ever-permeable boundary between self and other. 
    This paper addresses instances of <i>musique grotesque</i> in Louis XIV's 
    court ballets, and demonstrates the way that court musicians asserted the 
    "naturalness" of French musical language by poking fun at Italianate music 
    in the form of <i>musique grotesque</i>&#8212;fun that was always a risky 
    business as listeners increasingly took pleasure in the sounds of foreign 
    music.<br>

    <strong>Dancing Madmen: Comedy and Madness in Venetian <em>Balli</em><br>
    Maria Anne Purciello</strong><br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Originating 
    as part of Athens's annual "Great Dionysia," an ancient Greek dramatic festival 
    honoring the god Dionysus, the comic genre has always been closely bound to 
    the ideas of Dionysian revelry, vitality, and madness.&nbsp; Firmly rooted 
    in the ideas of contradiction and social reversal espoused by Dionysus and 
    his followers, comedy&#8217;s often mimetic combination of verbal and non-verbal 
    modes of communication had, by the seventeenth century, come to simultaneously 
    serve a reflective and restorative function in drama.&nbsp; Over the centuries, 
    these comic functions became associated with specific comic<em> topoi</em> 
    that gradually began to be inserted into even the most serious of dramatic 
    plots.&nbsp; Perhaps one of the most popular of these <em>topoi</em> to make 
    its way onto the operatic stages of seventeenth-century Venice was that of 
    madness.&nbsp; In its depiction of characters that exist within the social 
    structures of civilization, yet often, due to the nature of their illness, 
    forgivably step outside of the generally accepted modes of social decorum, 
    the topos of madness enabled the dramatists, actors, and dancers of the day 
    to utilize comedy both as a light-hearted means of inspiring laughter and 
    as a social corrective.&nbsp; As such, madness, with its inherent reversals 
    and contradictions, became a frequently used convention on spoken, improvised, 
    and sung stages alike.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper broadens the scope of current scholarship 
    on mad scenes found within the plots of early Venetian opera by examining 
    the intersection of comedy and madness as it specifically pertains to the 
    end-of-act<em> balli.</em> It explores how these <em>balli,</em> acting as 
    extensions to the dramatic ideas presented within the opera's plot, utilized 
    many of the same comic tropes that were often more subtly expressed in the 
    opera's mad scenes. Its careful consideration of <em>balli</em> performed 
    with <i>Le fortune di Rodope e Damira, Pompeo magno,</i> and <i>La finta pazza</i> 
    reveals that the frequently transparent exploitation of these comic tropes 
    in the <em>balli</em> achieved quite different ends: in featuring a wide array 
    of singing and dancing madmen, their depiction of madness exemplified both 
    the restorative and the reflective nature of comedy.<br>

    <strong>The Figure of Ulysses in Giacomo Badoaro and Claudio Monteverdi's<br>
    <em>Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria </em>(1640) <br>
    Hendrik Schulze </strong><br>
    </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"></div> </div> </font>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">When 
    Badoaro and Monteverdi decided to choose Ulysses as protagonist of what would 
    be their first original contribution for the new public spectacle of opera 
    at Venice, they opted for one of the least popular figures in the seventeenth 
    century.&nbsp; The epics of Homer were severely criticized for what was seen 
    as their poor drawing of character.&nbsp; Ulysses, versatile as he was, simply 
    was too ambivalent in his morals and his character to set an example for the 
    reader to look up to.&nbsp; So why did Badoaro and Monteverdi make their particular 
    choice, and why did the opera enjoy the great success it apparently had?&nbsp; 
    As an analysis of the representation of Ulysses in text and music shows, it 
    must have been the figure of Ulysses that drew both of them to this subject.&nbsp; 
    But the librettist&#8217;s and the composer&#8217;s images of their protagonist 
    were totally different from each other: while Badoaro saw in Ulysses the impersonal 
    allegory of Human Frailty, Monteverdi treated him as an individual with a 
    personal history.&nbsp; To represent their opposing ideas, the versatile figure 
    of Ulysses became an ideal protagonist.&nbsp; Nobody was more apt to be seen 
    as Human Frailty than the much-suffering Ulysses, while for the composer a 
    torn, ambiguous character provided more opportunity to touch the audience&#8217;s 
    hearts, using the most diverse and contrasting musical means.&nbsp; On the 
    other hand, the fact that all those contrasting characteristics were apparent 
    in a single protagonist provided for the unity of material that the drama 
    needed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper aims to show how by having opposing ideas 
    to represent their protagonist&#8212; which can explain many of the problems 
    posed by the disparity between the surviving score and libretti&#8212;Badoaro 
    and Monteverdi created very different images of Ulysses, thereby making different 
    statements about the genre of opera (Badoaro treats it as epic, but at the 
    same time makes a clear distinction between comedy and tragedy, while Monteverdi 
    takes it as a drama, mixing the genres to make it a <em>tragicomedia</em>).&nbsp; 
    In the end, Monteverdi&#8217;s image of Ulysses prevailed, making this figure 
    a prototype for the ideal operatic hero.<br>

    Wolfram Steude</font></strong><br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
    almost a century, German art history has recognized the term "German Renaissance" 
    for that transalpine art of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, 
    particularly architecture, that received important aesthetic impulses from 
    the Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but which 
    is not identical with them. In this presentation, I will consider the works 
    composed by the great Dresden court Kapellmeister Heinrich Sch&uuml;tz between 
    1611 and 1671, with the goal of recognizing and identifying in them idiomatic 
    trends of the Italian Late Renaissance of ca. 1600 on the one hand, and demonstrating 
    how these trends were transformed in the school of composition indebted to 
    the German tradition on the other.&nbsp; At the same time, this results in 
    a strict differentiation with respect to the art of the musical Baroque arising 
    in northern Italy around 1600, with which Sch&uuml;tz became acquainted, but 
    did not adopt.&nbsp; The analogy of Sch&uuml;tz&#8217;s artistic relationship 
    to that of his colleagues in the fine arts and architecture is too significant 
    to be cast off as irrelevant.&nbsp; In short, Sch&uuml;tz did not create his 
    works "between eras"; on the contrary, his art-historical and artistic position 
    is clearly definable.<font size="-2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (trans. Mary E. Frandsen)</font></small><br>

    <strong>&#8220;The Persuasive Difference&#8221;:<br>
    Acknowledging Diversity in Rhetorical Approaches<br>
    Jamie G. Weaver</strong></br> </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Although 
    students of Baroque music understand that the principles of rhetoric influenced 
    composition during the seventeenth century, the extent to which this knowledge 
    affects performance is not always clear. Rhetoric maintained a prominent place 
    in liberal arts instruction from antiquity, but did not remain unchanged. 
    Over time, regional trends developed for its study and practice.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-sixteenth century, France, Germany, and 
    England experienced significant developments in rhetoric. The ideas of the 
    Frenchman Petrus Ramus, who separated the components of invention and arrangement 
    from rhetoric, became popular and caused widespread educational reform. Rhetoric 
    began to be psychologized, and style, figures, and the movement of the affections 
    replaced structure and organization as its focus. Many students in France 
    and the German-speaking lands viewed the classical sources only through Ramus's 
    lens. In Italy, however, rhetorical practice remained closer to that of Cicero's 
    Rome. Although sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Italian schoolmasters published 
    rhetorical texts in profusion, rhetoric scholars regard them lightly because 
    they re-state material from classical sources, rather than expanding the newer 
    ideas expressed in contemporary non-Italian works. Ramus's reforms never penetrated 
    the educational system.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper will expose often-neglected ways 
    in which differing national rhetorical trends affected approaches to musical 
    rhetoric, and will offer suggestions for applying these practices to performance. 
    The treatises devoted to musical rhetoric are all German, and reflect the 
    literary trends of style categorization and psychologization of figures that 
    modern musicians know as the doctrine of affections. These trends, following 
    Ramus's educational reforms, permeated Germany, France, and England. Rhetoric 
    also remained important to composers of seventeenth-century Italy; the lack 
    of musico-rhetorical treatises found there does not prove otherwise. It shows, 
    rather, that the principles of classical oratory, in which Italian composers 
    and singers were instructed from childhood on, informed their composition 
    and performance. Rhetorical analysis based on German sources has become a 
    popular tool for realizing and reconstructing convincing delivery of all Western 
    European music of the seventeenth century. When one considers the diversity 
    in regional rhetorical tendencies, however, the validity of applying the same 
    brand of rhetorical analysis to such a vast body of music must be examined.<br>

    <strong>Rustic Unruliness:<br>
    The Musical Witch on the Early Modern English Stage<br>
    Amanda Eubanks Winkler</strong><br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
    witch, representative of political and religious rebellion, social decay, 
    poverty, ignorance, and the gender trouble presented by unruly women, was 
    domesticated for the pleasure of Jacobean and Caroline audiences, singing 
    and dancing in public, private, and court theaters for monarchs and plebeians 
    alike. Musical witches have prominent roles in Ben Jonson's <i>The Masque 
    of Queens</i> (1609), Thomas Middleton's <i>The Witch</i> (1615&#8211;16), 
    early seventeenth-century revivals of William Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth,</i> 
    as well as two plays based on actual witchcraft cases, Thomas Dekker, John 
    Ford, and William Rowley's <i>The Witch of Edmonton</i> (1621) and Thomas 
    Heywood and Richard Brome's <i>The Late Lancashire Witches </i>(1634).<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these works have captured a considerable amount 
    of scholarly attention over the past few decades, a comprehensive comparative 
    analysis of the extant music for Jacobean and Caroline witchcraft entertainments 
    has not been attempted. My paper fills this lacuna and demonstrates how playwrights 
    and composers used musical and dramatic conventions to mark witches as disorderly, 
    rural, ignorant, melancholic, and lower-class. Singing bawdy ballads, dancing 
    rustic rounds, morrises, and jigs, contorting their bodies with antic postures, 
    perverting religious ritual, producing "rough," dissonant music, and being 
    performed by cross-dressed adult men who imperfectly represented the female 
    body and voice, witches took their place with other grotesque and carnivalesque 
    figures symbolic of disorder. Despite the obvious strategies of marginalization 
    found in Jacobean and Caroline plays and masques, the witch's folk-influenced 
    songs and dances paradoxically contributed to her popularity and her power, 
    demonstrating the perils of assigning aurally appealing music to subversive 
    characters.</font></p>
