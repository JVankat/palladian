<p>First, activate the new battery</p>
<p>New laptop at the first boot, the battery itself should be 3% of electricity (which is also common practice firms. If you buy the first time you open the notebook, found that the battery is fully charged, must have been used by others.) At this point, you should run out the battery until it shut down, and then use an external power, charging time must be more than 12 hours, repeated three times, so as to activate the battery completely, can effectively improve the battery life.</p>
<p>Second, to reduce the number of battery</p>
<p>Minimize the number of battery, this method seems to be some people feel unhappy, and since bought a battery is not so frequently used, it bought Zuoshen. Having said that, but the battery charge and discharge is directly related to life, one charge, the battery to the aging step forward. Suggest that you use an external power supply, use an external power supply when the battery removed.

No memory effect on lithium to say, I had in front of businesses that are irresponsible and misleading. Lithium also have memory effect, but its memory effect smaller than nickel-metal hydride Bale. And battery charging in the same way, when you charge the battery to the laptop, try to avoid too long, the general control within 12 hours. As for the prevention of exposure to prevent damp to prevent the erosion of chemical liquids, avoid contact with the battery contacts and metal objects such as notes, not much to mention here also.</p>
<p>Fourth, long-term maintenance of batteries not</p>

Also, if the long-term (over the year) do not use the laptop battery should be charged to 50%, and the charge once a year in order to prevent battery over-discharge. Charging time may be better if the shutdown, but does not require to be shut down. Small</p>
