								<P>Controversy about nutrition seems a constant in the news. Yet in September 1992, the surprising target was milk. An organization called the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine held a press conference in which they claimed that cows' milk is hazardous to children's health, that parents should be warned of its dangers and that it should not be required or recommended in government guidelines. The Committee charged that cows' milk is harmful to health in a wide variety of ways. Let's look closely at these allegations to see if they are justified. </P>
<P><STRONG>The Allegations</STRONG> </P>
<P><STRONG>Cows' milk should not be fed to infants.</STRONG> This is true, but it is certainly not news. Experts have long known that unmodified cows' milk is unsuitable for infants in the first six months of life because its composition is too different from that of human breast milk. Recognized authorities, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, also recommend that unmodified cows' milk not be fed in the second six months of life. At this age, iron deficiency is the main concern. Cows' milk is low in iron, and the other foods commonly consumed by infants don't make up the difference. Also, unmodified cows' milk causes some babies to lose small but significant amounts of blood in their stool; important amounts of iron can be lost in this way. Breast milk is clearly the best milk throughout the first year of life, and iron-fortified infant formula is the only acceptable alternative. </P>
<P><STRONG>Cows' milk causes iron-deficiency anemia.</STRONG> It can, in infants, but infants shouldn't be drinking it. If they are not nursing, they should be drinking iron-fortified formula. The most commonly used formulas are made from cows' milk, but they contain added iron and they receive a heat treatment sufficient to inactivate the agent that causes intestinal blood loss. </P>
<P>An older child could become iron-deficient if he or she drinks too much milk and doesn't eat enough iron-rich foods. In such a case, the child obviously needs a better-balanced diet. The problem should not be "solved" by eliminating milk from the child's diet � that would just replace one type of dietary imbalance with another. </P>
<P><STRONG>Cows' milk is a common cause of allergy.</STRONG> Actually, food allergies in general are much less common than people believe. It is true, however, that when a real food allergy is diagnosed, cows' milk is a likely culprit. The small number of children who are actually allergic to cows' milk should avoid it in any form. However, there is no need for the rest of the population to avoid drinking milk just because a few people are allergic. </P>
<P><STRONG>Dairy products are high in fat and cholesterol.</STRONG> <STRONG>Therefore they cause heart disease.</STRONG> Actually, people who are concerned about fat and cholesterol do not need to avoid dairy products. They simply need to choose them carefully. Skim or 1 percent lowfat milk is perfectly acceptable for a person on a cholesterol-lowering diet. Lowfat or nonfat yogurts and cheeses are also good choices. A reduced-fat diet need not be dairy-free. </P>
<P><STRONG>Dairy products cause digestive problems.</STRONG> Some Americans, especially those of African or Asian heritage, develop gastrointestinal symptoms when they drink substantial amounts of milk. These symptoms are caused by the inability to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk. </P>
<P>Lactose-intolerant people do not need to eliminate all dairy products from their diets; they simply need to choose them carefully. Commercial lactose-reduced milk is available in many areas. Consumers can also buy enzyme drops in pharmacies and use them to treat milk at home. Hard cheeses, such as cheddar, Swiss and American, contain almost no lactose. Yogurt is also a good choice; the bacteria in yogurt culture digest lactose during passage through the digestive tract. Some lactose-intolerant people can even drink regular milk, as long as they limit the amount that they consume at any one time. The idea is to keep lactose intake down to a level that does not cause discomfort; the limit differs for different individuals. </P>
<P><STRONG>Cows' milk causes diabetes.</STRONG> This is the big one � the most frightening of the allegations made by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine. It is based on an overzealous interpretation of some very preliminary scientific evidence. </P>
<P>Scientists have suspected for years that early exposure to cows' milk proteins might be one of the factors that can trigger the onset of Type 1 diabetes mellitus in susceptible people. Type 1 diabetes is a severe form of the disease that usually begins in childhood or young adulthood. It has a strong hereditary component and, unlike the more common Type 2 diabetes that begins in later adulthood, it is not associated with obesity. </P>
<P>Some people who inherit the genetic predisposition to Type 1 diabetes develop the disease; others do not. Environmental factors may play a role in triggering the onset of clinical illness. Cows' milk proteins may be one of those factors because they increase the rate of disease in some animal models of Type 1 diabetes. Laboratory animals, however, do not always react in the same way that humans do, and experimentally induced model diseases can have important differences from the real thing. </P>
<P>Some studies of human populations have associated longer duration of breast feeding and/or delayed introduction of cows' milk into an infant's diet with lower risks of Type 1 diabetes. Other studies, however, have not confirmed these associations. There have even been cases of Type 1 diabetes in children who were never exposed to cows' milk in any form. </P>
<P>A much-publicized study released in the summer of 1992 showed that patients who had just been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes had high levels of an antibody to a particular cows' milk protein; healthy individuals had much lower levels. Despite the furor generated by this finding, no one really knows what it means. The high antibody levels may be a result rather than a cause of the metabolic derangement that occurs at the onset of diabetes. </P>
<P>Because this evidence is so preliminary and so poorly understood, all recognized authorities agree that it does not justify any recommendation for dietary modifications � not even in infants with a family history of Type 1 diabetes. The American Academy of Pediatrics, in particular, has taken strong exception to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine's stance on this issue. A spokesperson for the Academy accused the group of "practicing nutritional terrorism" by frightening American parents on the basis of such tentative scientific findings. </P>
<P><STRONG>Cows' milk contains dangerous contaminants.</STRONG> Actually, cows' milk is one of the most regulated commodities sold in the U.S. It rarely contains even detectable amounts of pesticide residues or animal drugs, let alone much larger amounts that could cause illness. However, one significant contamination problem has recently come to light � overfortification with vitamin D. </P>
<P>Vitamin D fortification of milk has played a crucial role in the near-elimination of the deficiency disease rickets in the U.S. It is essential, however, that fortification be carried out correctly. Excessive amounts of vitamin D can cause serious toxicity problems. </P>
<P>Studies published in 1992 showed that milk sold in the U.S. is sometimes underfortified or overfortified with vitamin D. In one instance, involving a Massachusetts dairy, extreme overfortification led to several cases of illness. Clearly, there is a need for better control of the fortification process. The necessary regulations already exist, but they should be enforced more strictly. </P>
<P>Health and nutrition authorities have urged that the policy of fortifying milk with vitamin D should not be abandoned; rickets is still a potential problem, especially in Northern latitudes, where sunlight may not provide enough vitamin D. It would be even more unwise to eliminate the consumption of milk in order to avoid vitamin D toxicity. </P>
<P><STRONG>Drinking cows' milk is unnatural; humans are the only creatures who drink the milk of another species.</STRONG> Well, yes, this is true. But the proponents of this argument don't seem to realize that practically everything else that we eat and drink is just as unnatural as milk. </P>
<P>On an evolutionary time scale, dairying is indeed a very recent invention. So is the milling of grains. Grains are the staple food for most people today, but until 15,000 years ago, our ancestors didn't eat them because they didn't know how to mill them. They didn't eat poultry or fish either, not until about 20,000 years ago. They did eat red meats and vegetables, but the variety and composition were very different from those of the meats and vegetables that we consume today. It is impossible to return to the diet that was "natural" for the human species; agriculture has transformed the world's food supply. </P>
<P><STRONG>People don't need to drink milk.</STRONG> It's easy to get plenty of calcium from other food sources. It is possible to get enough calcium, but it's far from easy. Dairy products are the principal source of calcium in the U.S. diet, and most of the other foods that Americans prefer are not rich in this mineral. Getting enough calcium from a dairy-free diet requires the use of large amounts of foods not favored by most American children, such as fish with edible bones, leafy green vegetables, broccoli, tofu and legumes. (It takes roughly one cup of legumes plus one cup of leafy greens to supply as much calcium as a glass of milk.) Even the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine doesn't find it easy to plan a dairy-free diet with adequate calcium content. In two of the three sample menus included in their literature, they resort to artificially fortified foods (fortified soy milk and calcium-fortified orange juice) to provide a substantial portion of the day's calcium supply. </P>
<P><STRONG>A Safe and Nutritious Food</STRONG> </P>
<P>Of course, cows' milk is not a perfect food. It doesn't need to be. No single food can meet all nutrient needs or be suitable for unlimited consumption by everyone. Some people, especially those who must limit their intakes of fat or lactose, must choose dairy products carefully. The few people with true cows' milk allergies must avoid dairy products. Infants under one year should not drink unmodified cows' milk. </P>
<P>There is no scientific justification, however, for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine's campaign to eliminate cows' milk from the American diet. As Dr. Ronald E. Kleinman of the American Academy of Pediatrics stated, in response to the Committee's allegations, "Milk and dairy products are safe and nutritious foods for growing children, and parents should make use of them unless there's some specific medical reason to avoid them... Dairy products are not perfect foods, but they are concentrated with many of the forms of nutrients that children need to grow well." </P>
<P><STRONG>Irresponsible Medicine</STRONG>? </P>
<P>One can't help but wonder why the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine is acting in an apparently irresponsible manner by exaggerating the alleged hazards of milk. Why are they milking a very preliminary diabetes study for more than it's worth and frightening American parents in the process? The Committee is known for its strong support of total vegetarianism and its opposition to the exploitation of animals. Could these philosophical viewpoints have distorted the Committee's evaluation of the scientific evidence? </P>
