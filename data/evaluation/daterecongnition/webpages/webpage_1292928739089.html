About a year ago (as we are writing this), Dr. Donald Gaver, the
distinguished chair of operations research at the Naval Postgraduate
School, called us and asked if we could develop a presentation for a
session on Information Warfare that he was chairing for the Atlanta
National INFORMS Meeting. At that time, we were just finishing an
analysis of cruise missile threat strategies and had become
interested in how those strategies carried over to Information
Warfare, so Dr. Gaver's invitation gave us an added incentive. That
presentation, on which this paper is based, explored what we had
learned, namely that the (expected or possible) changes in warfare
brought about by the technology and paradigm of information were
fraught with new potential fragilities that transcend the traditional
scope of warfare.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

Most of this analysis was done at the strategic level, so most of
the tools we used were strategic in nature, and there remains
considerable room for additional analysis, mostly at the operational
and tactical level. These tools were varied, ranging from classical
military analytical techniques such as Kritik [1] and deficiency
analysis through Jones' Force-to-Space model [2], as well as the
usual library of operations research techniques. Since more work is
possible, we will try to indicate the directions we think those
efforts might take.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

As the Cold War was winding down, and the Soviet Union and the
Berlin Wall were collapsing, military-political thinkers and planners
recognized that the nature of the world was changing. One of those
changes was the likelihood of what is now called a Revolution in
Military Affairs [3]. A "Revolution in Military Affairs is a major
change in the nature of warfare brought about by the innovative
application of new technologies which, when combined with dramatic
changes in Military Doctrine and Operational and Organizational
Concepts, fundamentally alters the character and conduct of military
operations."[4] Since then, we have seen changes that enormously
alter the face of American military operations: the rebirth of
Regionalism, long submerged by superpower competition; the spread of
democracy, with its sweet promise and bitter disappointment of
(dis)enfranchisement; the difficulties of projecting just power from
North America; and the evidence of technological efficiency in the
form of precision delivery weapons and digital information processing
and communication.<BR>

<BR><BR>

<B>Information Age Warfare</B><BR>

The vision, doctrine and practice of this new environment for
military operations is collected under a variety of names, one of
which is Information Age Warfare. In simple terms, Information Age
Warfare may be seen as the union of classical warfare with the
cultural and technological aspects of information. We depict this in
Figure 1, which is adapted from Molander et al.[5].<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

<IMG SRC="art/WARFARE-F1.gif" WIDTH=245 HEIGHT=206

<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

In walking our way through this figure, we may start with the
upper right hand corner. Modern Warfare (Cold War) was essentially
the persisting warfare of modern mechanized (ground and air) forces
with components associated with nation building (aimed at containment
of the Soviet Union), and pieces of Information Warfare such as
psychological operations (playing rock music outside Manuel Noriega's
palace in Panama), and intercepting radio transmissions. When
combined with the political environment of the post-Cold War world,
the scope of Modern Warfare reorients to place greater emphasis on
what is known as Operations Other Than War (including disaster
relief, counter-terrorism and counter-drug operations, and peace
keeping and enforcement).<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

On the left hand side of the figure, we may start with the
technology of information -- processing, storage and communications
-- much of which is purely commercial and gives rise to the culture
and infrastructure of cyberspace such as the Internet. This "new"
environment gives rise to Information Warfare which not only subsumes
some of the old pieces such as deception, psychological operations,
jamming and interception, but adds all of the vulnerabilities
implicit to the information technology and culture such as computer
viruses and spamming. (In military terms, the first attacks computer
operating systems or programs and compromises their performance; the
second clogs the communication links and disrupts timely transfer of
information.)<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

The union of these two is Information Age Warfare, but is more
than a simple combination. One feature of Information Age Warfare is
the perception that control of information may be more important than
air superiority was in previous wars. Information technology is more
than just an enhancement of traditional military command and control,
it changes the whole vision of military operations. Of course, very
few missions can be accomplished solely with information means;
information dominance without military means will not hold or take
contested ground.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

Another feature of Information Age Warfare is a blurring of
traditional boundaries. This blurring is multi-dimensional, but one
of the most obvious is the distinctions among the philosophical
levels of strategic-operational-tactical organization. As we studied
these interactions, and in particular this blurring, the evidence for
new fragilities became a recurring theme.<BR>

<BR><BR>

<B>Fragility and Information Age Warfare</B><BR>

Most of us have some vision of what fragility is, and we commonly
associate it with physical properties. Crystal vases are fragile, but
Tupperware is not. In a military context, we extend the vision to
include organizations, practices and procedures. Simply put,
fragility is an inherent inability, realized or not, to respond to
changes in external conditions. In a context of mission
accomplishment, fragility is a substantial source of risk, and
therefore its identification, reduction and control are critical. By
its nature, fragility may occur from either the overt actions of the
enemy or what Clausewitz called the "friction of war" -- those
natural occurrences which sap energy and resources during the course
of military operations [6].<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

To address these "new" fragilities, we first identify some of the
defining features of Information Age Warfare. These are listed in
Figure 2. We will consider each of these in turn.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

<IMG SRC="art/WARFARE-F2.gif" WIDTH=209 HEIGHT=146
X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=left hspace=8><br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

<B><I>Feature 1: Low Cost Entry.</I></B> One of the consequences
of both the rapid technological advance of "information" and the
reductions in military budgets is concurrent adoption of both
commercial technology and systems, and dependence on commercial
"information" providers for equipment and services (e.g., the Gulf
War could not have been fought without AT&amp;T, MCI and SPRINT).
Both of these are a source of fragility since the military systems
not only share the same weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the civil
systems, but increasingly depend on complex civil networks whose very
complexity and concentration assume a peaceful, well-behaved
environment. The vulnerabilities of these systems to "hackers"
(misused in the common connotation here) who may extract information,
introduce inaccurate information, or introduce diseases such as
viruses is a fragility of modern folklore. Combating these
vulnerabilities is more than a matter of strengthening access
security, but includes such measures as counter-hackers which
conjures an image illustrating the changes in Information Age Warfare
(computer nerds in uniform?).<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

The fragility of this feature is not limited to the information
infrastructure. This technology also permits the proliferation of
low-cost weapons either on a garage-industry level or nationally
without substantial investment in lengthy and costly research and
development efforts and infrastructure. These weapons can be
available to everyone from disgruntled individuals (the Unabomber)
through terrorist groups (nationally sponsored or otherwise) to
nations (or "wannabes"). Anyone with hard cash, a modicum of
technical savvy and will can manufacture or buy precision weapons,
and, courtesy of CNN, inflict grave physical and psychological damage
on the populace without placing the perpetrators at risk like the car
bombing of the Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City. Thus we may
be confronted with attacks that come from some unknown actor. If the
attacks are made against information assets, we may not be able to be
sure they are attacks.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

Sadly, international controls on this technology are probably
impossible both due to the political realities of the post-Cold War
with its rebirth of Regionalism and national competition, and the
ascendancy of commercial consumerism with its engine of technological
proliferation.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

This is an area rife with opportunity for both operations research
experiment and analysis. How vulnerable are these systems? Even
defining the scope of the threat is fertile. For example, we may want
to distinguish between terrorist "hacking" which emplaces information
bombs that might disrupt vital services (electric, telephone or
banking) if the hackers are not placated with publicity or
privileges, and military "hacking" which attacks military capability
by disrupting "just in time" commercial activities which are crucial
to military effectiveness. Enumerating these possibilities amounts to
essentially reverse engineering the whole information network back
through the entire societal infrastructure -- an operations research
task that can provide an infinite number of degree projects for
graduate students for years.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

<B><I>Feature 2: Blurred Traditional Boundaries.</I></B> As we
indicated earlier, one of the features of the modern world is a
blurring of traditional boundaries. Part of this was telegraphed
decades ago by the rise of multi-national corporations, and part of
it results from the end of the Cold War with Regionalism emerging
anew. Forces of regional, political, ethnic or religious determinism,
perhaps frustrated by newly introduced democratic processes and the
discovery of true minority status, have been unleashed. While
Clausewitz's statement that "War is a continuation of policy by other
means"[7] seems to remain valid, the usual consideration that only
nations make policy (and thereby war) must be updated. Basically, any
group with a policy goal and the will to use force to achieve it
takes on nation-like characteristics in being able to wage
Information Age War. This complicates the problem of identifying the
attacker and determining what action to take in response. A
nationally-sponsored terrorist cruise missile attack on Epcot Center
would have national psychological as well as local physical effect
(and that locality could be very large if the warhead were nuclear,
or more likely, chemical or biological), but our response?<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

This is another area fertile for operations research
investigation. As an example, what are the precise organizational
dynamics that lead a group to assume this will? Alternately, what is
the nature and dynamics of alliances?[8]<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

<B><I>Feature 3: Expanded Role for Perception
Management.</I></B><I> </I>The proliferation of interest groups with
political agendas has been accompanied by increases in communication
availability. While the news media (bashing for liberal bias aside)
may not be naively susceptible to their propaganda, these groups have
extensive opportunity for broadcast, notably the Internet and fax
machines. Indeed, the Information Age is characterized by more
sources and quantities of information than can be digested. (Relevant
information seems to increase much slower than total information, so
time for understanding suffers at the cost of filtering.) Coupled
with the evolution and expansion of ethical and moral value ranges in
our culture, a fragility of marshaling national will emerges.
Increasing quantities of information and diversities of values
combine to complicate consensus while solidity of value and purpose
not only permit interest groups to act but to publicly rationalize
their actions. Factor in distrust of large or established
organizations (e.g., the government), and the fragility only deepens.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

The connection between information visibility and
disenfranchisement seems illogical, but it is the other side of the
public discussion coin. Traditionally, information (media) visibility
was limited and concentrated on perceived power groups (in the United
States, the two largest political parties and the largest public
interest organizations.) This drove small interest groups to
compromise their tenets and goals to combine together to grow larger
and gain information visibility. These groups then grew further
because of their increased visibility and the marginal acceptability
of their tenets and goals to newcomers. Accretion of the disaffected
was assured by the visibility and the limited choices available. Of
course, size translated directly into power.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

With information visibility available to all, the groups have less
incentive to combine and thus derive a consensual position. While
this means that the individual newcomer can more likely find an
interest group which has goals and tenets closely matching those of
the newcomer, it also means that no large, consensual or centrist
group emerges and gains power. The individual groups thus suffer
disenfranchisement because they have insufficient membership to
achieve political power in a democracy.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

<B><I>Feature 4: Strategic Intelligence Inadequate.</I></B> Since
nations developed, they have gathered intelligence on their potential
and actual enemies. This task, once simple but large when the Soviet
Union and the Warsaw Pact presented a monolithic threat, is now
enlarged and complicated by the sheer diversity of actors including
not only traditional nations but terrorists, drug cartels and
political aspirants as well. Public repugnance of intelligence
gathering is another source of fragility.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

<B><I>Feature 5: Tactical Warning and Assessment.</I></B> Given
the vulnerability of information networks to attack (itself difficult
to trace and even discern) and the feasibility and efficacy of
attacking logistic targets of national value and visibility, this
lack of intelligence (information) makes prevention more difficult
and response more problematic. Sherlock Holmes could not solve
mysteries without observations. Even with seemingly inexhaustible
sources of information, it is hard to analyze these situations. (We
received about 50 separate e-mails after TWA Flight 800 went down
asking if it could be due to a missile attack. It is a simple matter,
using publicly accessible data on warhead size and system ranges, to
show that shoulder-fired missiles were vanishingly unlikely to have
been capable of the downing, and that missiles large enough to effect
downing would have required resources and infrastructure available
only to nations. Despite this and growing evidence of an internal
failure, missile hypotheses still proliferate.)<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

Obviously, knowing something is an attack depends on recognizing
what attacks are possible and profitable. Understanding the complex
dynamics of the societal infrastructure is a precursor to this and
would be a follow-on to OR analyses that we indicated earlier.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

<B><I>Feature 6: Building and Sustaining Coalitions is
Complicated</I>.</B> History teaches us that coalitions are difficult
to construct and more difficult to maintain. Given the current
environment of national and economic bloc commercial competition,
regionalism, and the absence of a clearly defined and common enemy,
modern coalitions are more problematic than ever. When we factor in
global interdependence (the Ford Escort has parts from 100
countries), we find yet another fragility of Information Age Warfare.
Fundamentally, we encounter a situation where our neighbors may have
sold our enemies (whoever they are) their weapons, those neighbors
may or may not be willing to "fight" on our side (and they may be on
the "other" side tomorrow so be careful what technology we share with
them), and we are dependent on some of their resources, services or
products which, in turn, are vulnerable to attack. Even without the
other complications, the latter situation makes an irresolvable
fragility. Future coalitions seem likely to be have either many
members (everybody plays) or none (nobody plays).<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

Again, we have already indicated that there is fertile ground here
for OR analysis of organizational dynamics -- in this case, coalition
dynamics. The question here is complicated by the inclusion of risk
management.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

<B><I>Feature 7: Vulnerability of the U. S. Homeland</I>.</B> We
have all lived with the vulnerability of the United States to attack
for 50 years, but that threat was basically only from the Soviet
Union -- it was not a diffuse threat. More importantly, before
intercontinental ballistic missiles, attack was considerable only
during war and then not truly conceivable. Given the accessibility
and cost of attack, whether to information infrastructure or to
logistic targets by high technology ad hoc weapons, capability to
attack the American homeland is not inconsiderable. While intent
cannot be easily demonstrated because of the potential lack of
intelligence (and is outside the purview of intelligence), political
actors, products of regionalism and democratization have proliferated
and have known agendas that can be advanced by attack. Couple this
with the difficulty of marshaling national will engendered by "spin
doctoring" and the persuasiveness of information, and another
fragility emerges. We may be attacked in our homes, but we may not
know we have been attacked, we may not know who attacked us, and we
may not be able to react to the attack. In some ways, this is the
most frightening fragility of all, of living in an environment not
only of increasing complexity and stress but of violence as well.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

Psychologists tell us that the way to combat our fears is to
recognize and confront them. Considerable components of the
fragilities identified here derive from areas which lie at the core
of INFORMS members' knowledge, skills and interests. As operations
researchers and management scientists, we have a natural opportunity
to use our professional abilities to recognize and confront these
"fears."<BR>

<BR><BR>

<B>Summary</B><BR>

The modern world with its advances in information technology and
infrastructure have a leavening effect on not only military
operations but the world as a whole. Society has become increasingly
interconnected and interdependent, now possibly denying us personal
autonomy and sanctuary. Boundaries of what differentiates military
from civil or political action and nations from other organizations
are blurring. Regionalism and democratization have increased the
number of political actors while technology has made the American
homeland vulnerable to information and/or physical attack.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

These vulnerabilities do not have to become actual losses, but the
potential for those losses has increased. As society has become more
complex, the traditional means for society to police itself have
become susceptible to new fragilities which at least complicate, and
possibly compromise, maintaining that society.<br>
<img src="cleardot.gif" width=1 height=1 vspace=12 border=0><br>

Assuring that these fragilities never actuate, or controlling
their scope if they do, is a fertile field of endeavor for operations
research and management science. Examples of this are in the areas of
information, organizational and societal infrastructure dynamics to
identify the nature of information disruption, interest group
activation, and the nature of coalitions.<BR>
