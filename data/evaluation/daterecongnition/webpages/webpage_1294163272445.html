				<h3><a href="http://blogs.wyomingnews.com/blogs/sports/2010/10/05/week-6-class-4a-top-five/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Week 6 Class 4A top five" class="h3">Week 6 Class 4A top five</a></h3> 
				<p>I just submitted my second ballot for the WyoPreps.com Class 4A football poll. Here’s my top five and why I slotted each team where I did.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 1 Casper Natrona County</strong><br />
The Mustangs (6-0) routed Cheyenne East 53-3. I watched that game in person and Natrona is talented, explosive and balanced. I&#8217;ll have a little more on that in the next few days.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 2 Gillette</strong><br />
The Camels (5-1) scored three touchdowns in the last five minutes to beat Cheyenne Central 28-23. Central had Gillette on the ropes, but couldn&#8217;t finish. As much Central lost that game, Gillette deserves credit for also winning that game and not just laying down when it trailed 23-7. Winning means the Camels stay at No. 2 on my ballot.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 3 Sheridan</strong><br />
The Broncs (5-1) did what every other team in this state has done &#8212; pummel Laramie. Sheridan beat the Plainsmen 35-0 and stay at No. 3.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 4 Evanston</strong><br />
The Red Devils (5-1) beat Casper Kelly Walsh 28-10 and stay at No. 4.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 5 Cheyenne Central</strong><br />
In some ways the Indians (3-3) are in this spot by default since they have the fifth-best record in the state and no other team is .500. However, Central is deserving of this ranking. It&#8217;s been close in all three of its losses.<br />
<br />
It trailed top-ranked Natrona 10-9 in the third quarter before losing 31-9. It led Evanston late before the Red Devils went bananas and won 47-24. <em>And</em> it led Gillette 23-7 with five minutes left before losing 28-23.<br />
<br />
Central obviously is a good team, but it needs to learn how to put it all together and how to finish.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://blogs.wyomingnews.com/blogs/sports/2010/09/28/week-5-class-4a-top-five/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Week 5 Class 4A top five" class="h3">Week 5 Class 4A top five</a></h3> 
				<p>I just submitted my second ballot for the WyoPreps.com Class 4A football poll. Here&#8217;s my top five and why I slotted each team where I did.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 1 Casper Natrona County</strong><br />
The Mustangs (5-0) throttled Green River just like they have every other team this season.</p>
<p><strong>No. 2 Gillette</strong><br />
The Camels (4-1) move from No. 4 to the second slot after taking a 27-24 overtime win at previously No. 2-ranked Sheridan. Sheridan is a very good ballclub and Gillette went on the road and gutted out a rivalry win over the reigning Class 4A state champs. This win undoes Gillette&#8217;s terrible home loss to Evanston to start the season.</p>
<p><strong>No. 3 Sheridan</strong><br />
I still think the Broncs (4-1) might be one of the top two teams in the state, but I can&#8217;t justify keeping them at No. 2 after losing at home to Gillette. However, I can easily justify only dropping them one slot to third after that game. It&#8217;s was a three-point home loss in overtime. Gillette was the better team that night and will be the better team in this week&#8217;s poll, but the Broncs are still a slam dunk in the top three.</p>
<p><strong>No. 4 Evanston</strong><br />
Shifting at the top of the poll keeps the Red Devils (4-1) at No. 4 this week.</p>
<p><strong>No. 5 Cheyenne Central</strong><br />
The Indians (3-2) beat previously-No. 5-ranked Cheyenne East 38-22. Senior quarterback Thad Lane was feeling it, throwing for more than 320 yards and five touchdowns to help Central overcome a 14-point hole.</p>
<p>I said last week, I thought East was the better of the two teams, but that Friday&#8217;s game would be the barometer of which team truly was better at this point in the season.</p>
<p>East seemingly used most of the weapons in its arsenal to blow off most of its own toes (see its turnovers and 13-plus penalties as evidence), but Central <code>won a rivalry game by 16 points and clearly earned the No. 5 slot.</code></p>

				<h3><a href="http://blogs.wyomingnews.com/blogs/sports/2010/09/25/captial-bowl-thoughts/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Captial Bowl thoughts" class="h3">Captial Bowl thoughts</a></h3> 
				<p>Brick Cegelski wasn&#8217;t sure what type of football team he had prior to Friday&#8217;s Capital Bowl football game with Cheyenne East.</p>
<p>The Cheyenne Central football coach wasn&#8217;t sure if his team would figure out it has the talent to play with any team in the state. That&#8217;s still true even though the Indians are the only team in Class 4A to give Casper Natrona County a good game this season.</p>
<p>The Indians&#8217; 38-22 win at Riske Field gives him a good idea of the team he has now. They showed gumption when they got down 14-0 in the first quarter and when the Thunderbirds responded late in the second quarter to take the lead back at 22-19. Most teams in that situation are so caught off guard by that happening, they can&#8217;t respond.</p>
<p>Central showed the fight that has come to define Cegelski-coached football teams. And he couldn&#8217;t be more pleased.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a big win for us,&#8221; Cegelski said. &#8220;As far as positioning down the road, I really like what it does for our chances to get in the playoffs. That&#8217;s our ultimate goal is to make it to the playoffs and see what we can do there. If we match up again with (East), we match up again with them. That&#8217;s the nice thing about the way the Wyoming high schools are set up. I think this win is very huge for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way the Indians&#8217; passing attack exploded against East is a huge reason for Cegelski liking his team right now, too.</p>
<p>Central Senior quarterback Thad Lane picked a fitting time to have his best game of the season. He finished 21-for-31 for 323 yards, five touchdowns and two interceptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this win is really big for us,&#8221; Lane said. &#8220;We have to take this momentum and go up to Gillette and build on this win. We need to get a boost from this.&#8221;</p>
<p>That kind of passing attack will make Central (3-2) a difficult team to play. And when you add the confidence the Indians now have, they are a dangerous bunch right now.</p>
<p>Whether that will lead Central to a win on the road next week against Gillette is any one&#8217;s best guess. If the Indians play next Friday as they did the last three quarters against East, they probably will.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Thad and both Joshes (Borm and Braunschweig) did some good things for us,&#8221; Cegelski said. &#8220;We saw a lot of open looks and a lot of man-coverage. It&#8217;s just one of those things where if they&#8217;re going to run a lot of man coverage, then we need to be able to rub them a little bit. If we can get the ball in some of these kids&#8217; hands, we have some speed on the edge that can make some plays. We know we have some good kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>The task for Chad Goff and the T-Birds (2-3) doesn&#8217;t get any easier with Natrona in town. The biggest thing Goff wanted his team to take from Friday&#8217;s loss to Central was that it needs to play four quarters.</p>
<p>No matter how well the T-Birds start, they have to carry that over. If they don&#8217;t, it does them no good.</p>
<p>&#8220;We come out and do great things in the first quarter and we let down in the second,&#8221; Goff said. &#8220;Then we finish it strong. Then we come back out in the third and it goes back and forth a little bit.  Then we just shut it down. We&#8217;ve been a down a few times this season, and this was our best effort so far when we are down. Other times when we&#8217;ve been down, our effort hasn&#8217;t been as good as this.&#8221;</p>

				<h3><a href="http://blogs.wyomingnews.com/blogs/sports/2010/09/20/my-class-4a-top-five/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to My Class 4A top five" class="h3">My Class 4A top five</a></h3> 
				<p>I just submitted my top five for the WyoPreps.com football poll. This is the first week I voted in the poll because I wanted a good sample of games on which to base my votes. Here&#8217;s my top five and my reason for each vote.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 1 Casper Natrona County</strong><br />
The Mustangs (4-0) have trucked everyone in their path and are clearly the best team in the state at this point in the year. Only one of those teams – Evanston – has a winning record, but Natrona even hammered the Red Devils 34-10 in Evanston.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 2 Sheridan</strong><br />
The reigning state champions (4-0) have an incredible defense and are holding teams to a shade more than 8 points per game. The Broncs have beaten Rock Springs (1-3) and Green River (0-4) by a combined 12 points the past two weeks. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to hold that against Sheridan. I&#8217;ve seen both Rock Springs and Green River in person. I know it sounds cliché, but those are the best 1-3 and 0-4 teams in the state.<br />
<br />
That Sheridan-Natrona game in the final week of the regular season is going to be epic. I wish I could be there to see it in person, but I think we stand a pretty good chance seeing this matchup in the state title game in Laramie.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 3 Evanston</strong><br />
The Red Devils (3-1) stunned the state when they went all the way from the southwest corner to the northwest corner and hammered Gillette 44-21. Their lone loss came at home to top-ranked Natrona.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 4 Gillette</strong><br />
The Camels drubbed Cheyenne East 42-14 this week to improve to 3-1. This is a young Gillette team and they got shocked in the opening week. That home loss to Evanston is the only thing keeping the Red Devils ahead of Gillette in my poll at the moment. I really think Gillette would top Evanston on a neutral field at this point in the year.<br />
<br />
<strong>No. 5 Cheyenne East</strong><br />
The Thunderbirds (2-2) are a bit bi-polar at this point in the year. They&#8217;ve played well at home, but have laid two eggs on the road, losing to Sheridan 46-20 and Gillette 42-14. I think East is a good team and the rest of the season will bear that out. However, at this point, they&#8217;re a distant fifth in my poll.<br />
<br />
East is ahead of Cheyenne Central in my poll because I think East is a slightly better team than Central (2-2) right now. Both team&#8217;s two wins have come over teams with combined records of 1-7, but Central&#8217;s most recent win came over a hapless Laramie squad that has been outscored 207-38 this season.<br />
<br />
The best part about that little argument is that we&#8217;ll get a chance to see which team really is better at this point in the year when East travels to Central&#8217;s Milt Riske Field for a 5 p.m. kickoff this Friday.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to share your opinions on the top five.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://blogs.wyomingnews.com/blogs/sports/2010/08/27/blog-breakdown-cheyenne-central-football/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Blog breakdown: Cheyenne Central football" class="h3">Blog breakdown: Cheyenne Central football</a></h3> 
				<p>The Indians return just three starters from last year&#8217;s team that went 9-3 and lost to Sheridan 40-15 in the Class 4A state championship game. That would be cause for concern with most teams, but not with longtime Central coach Brick Cegelski. This year&#8217;s team is every bit as senior-laden as last year&#8217;s. He thinks that maturity will carry his team a long way.<br />
<br />
<strong>Quarterback</strong><br />
Senior Thad Lane will be the man under center for the Indians this fall. Central coach Brick Cegelski likes his maturity and leadership.<br />
<br />
&#8220;He&#8217;s calling a lot of the play himself and we&#8217;re conferring about what he should be looking at,&#8221; Cegelski said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really happy because I think our offense is even more advanced now. I&#8217;m happy with where he&#8217;s brought that and I hope it&#8217;s something we&#8217;re going to be doing throughout the season.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Lane played sparingly last season, going 0-for-3 passing. He also carried the ball four times for six yards. However, it should be noted that there were a few times last year when Cegelski told me he was more than confident in Lane&#8217;s ability to effectively guide the offense should then-senior Connor Long get injured.<br />
<br />
<strong>Running back</strong><br />
Senior Austin Breckenridge will be splitting carries with Dre Davis and Casey Jackson. Cegelski describes Breckenridge as shifty, Davis as a power back and Jackson as a &#8220;speed guy.&#8221; Breckenridge posted 539 yards and 5 touchdowns on 99 carries as the backup last season.<br />
<br />
&#8220;We&#8217;re pretty excited to have all three of those guys,&#8221; Cegelski said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a good mix.&#8221;<br />
<br />
This is Jackon&#8217;s first year playing high-school football.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to get him for years,&#8221; Cegelski said. &#8220;He&#8217;s had some shoulder issues and that&#8217;s been the big thing. He&#8217;s matured and he&#8217;s put some time in toward getting better. I told him all along that football might be a pretty good game for him and I think he realizes that.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<strong>Wide receiver</strong><br />
Junior Josh Braunschweig and senior Josh Borm will be the top two guys for Central this year. Borm caught 23 passes for 193 yards and three scores last fall. Braunschweig hauled in six for 95 and two TDs.<br />
<br />
Junior Matt Munoz, sophomore David Reidl and seniors Zachariah Espinoza and Derian Wilson are also in the mix. Wilson recently moved to Cheyenne from Texas.<br />
<br />
&#8220;We have about six kids outside who can run and we think can do some pretty good things,&#8221; Cegelski said.<br />
<br />
<strong>Offensive line</strong><br />
Sophomore James Fossett will most likely be Central&#8217;s center, while seniors Zach Peck (left guard), Clint McAllister (left tackle), Anthony Haak (right guard), Anthony Reidl (right tackle) round out the starting unit. Senior Dallas Tyrrell also will figure in on the left side.<br />
<br />
&#8220;They&#8217;re doing great things for us and are starting to get a good feel for each other,&#8221; Cegelski said. &#8220;We&#8217;re still confused on all of our calls and dummy calls versus regular calls. But they&#8217;re progressing. We don&#8217;t know what they can do yet, but we think they&#8217;re going to be capable of great things.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<strong>Defensive line</strong><br />
Junior Robert Armitage, Peck and Haak are in the rotation to see significant time as defensive tackles. Cegelski didn&#8217;t name any defensive ends, but said the coaches have been pleased with them, thus far.<br />
<br />
<strong>Linebackers</strong><br />
Junior Matt Carver was an absolute terror last season, posting 118 tackles (34 solo). He&#8217;s picked up right where he left off according to Cegelski.<br />
<br />
&#8220;He feels like he&#8217;s missed out on the weight room (because of summer baseball) and he&#8217;s trying to play catch up in there,&#8221; Cegelski said. &#8220;He&#8217;s really good right now, but he&#8217;ll be even better by mid-season when he&#8217;s had some time in the weight room. He has a great feel for the game and just knows where to go and what to do. I think you couldn&#8217;t ask for a better middle linebacker for our program.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brandt Douglas will play the strong side while Mike Hughes and Dre Davis will play on the weakside.<br />
<br />
&#8220;We think we&#8217;re going to be pretty good there, but we have to stay healthy and do the things we&#8217;re coached to do,&#8221; Cegelski said.<br />
<br />
<strong>Secondary</strong><br />
Munoz and Braunschweig will be the corners. Breckenridge and Borm will play strong and free safety, respectively.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://blogs.wyomingnews.com/blogs/sports/2010/06/14/shrine-bowl-reflections/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Shrine Bowl reflections" class="h3">Shrine Bowl reflections</a></h3> 
				<p>The Shrine Bowl is always a fun and difficult event to cover and this year was no exception.<br />
<br />
The fun part is seeing many of the state&#8217;s best high-school football players strap it up and square off against each other in a North-South game. There&#8217;s always a good crowd &#8212; even when it&#8217;s really cold and rainy like it was Saturday &#8212; and that crowd fervently aligns with whichever side their school is on.<br />
<br />
The tough part comes in the time the game ends, the abundance of unnecessary people overflowing the booth at Casper Natrona County High&#8217;s Cheney Alumni Field and taking table space away from working media, finding the players you need to interview in the swell of people that flow onto the field after the game and getting over my own desire not to interrupt those players while they chat up their family and friends.<br />
<br />
This year&#8217;s Shrine Bowl was the best of the four or five I&#8217;ve covered during my time at the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. It ended 27-26 with Cody&#8217;s Matt Frost kicking a 34-yard field goal with less than 47 seconds remaining to give the North the win. Frost had never attempted a field goal or point-after touchdown prior to Shrine Bowl practice, but also made a 41-yard field goal and both extra-points Saturday. Not too shabby.<br />
<br />
The game featured five lead changes and the series is now tied 17-17-3.<br />
<br />
South quarterback Wesley Padilla of Rock Springs was the game&#8217;s offensive most valuable player, while Hulett&#8217;s Leland Pfeifer won defensive MVP honors from the North team. Those two just so happen to be the players I voted for.<br />
<br />
However, it could have been a clean sweep from the North had the media, statisticians and other folks in the booth not submitted their ballots with about four minutes remaining. I say that because Sheridan quarterback Austin Woodward helped lead the North to victory by completing three passes for 57 yards on the final drive, including two to Natrona&#8217;s Taylor Villegas for 52 yards. Woodward&#8217;s numbers were comparable to Padilla&#8217;s and his team won. Villegas caught five passes for 113 yards and a touchdown. However, he was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct on the fourth play of the game-winning drive.<br />
<br />
Wheatland&#8217;s Tyler Smart was my second choice for defensive MVP. He finished with nine tackles (five solo) while playing linebacker and covering kicks for the South squad.<br />
<br />
Saturday&#8217;s was a really exciting game and one I was glad I was assigned to cover.</p>

				<p>Cheyenne Central announced Friday it has hired Doug Moratzka as its boys basketball coach.<br />
<br />
Moratzka is a 1981 Cheyenne East graduate and played at Idaho State University from 1982-85. He also played professionally in Puerto Rico.<br />
<br />
He previously coached at Rigby High in Rigby, Idaho, where he led the Trojans to a Class 4A High Country Conference regular season championship and two runner-up finishes.<br />
<br />
He spent last year as the assistant head coach at Hillcrest High in Ammon, Idaho, which is part of the Idaho Falls metro area. The Knights went 22-4 and placed third in the Class 4A state tournament.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://blogs.wyomingnews.com/blogs/sports/2010/04/08/sibling-rivalry/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Sibling rivalry" class="h3">Sibling rivalry</a></h3> 
				<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for siblings to compete on opposite sides of the Cheyenne Central-Cheyenne East rivalry. However, they&#8217;re usually around the same age and wearing uniforms. That&#8217;s not the case for Colby and Trenton Keller.<br />
<br />
Colby Keller is a senior at East and the Thunderbirds&#8217; starting goalkeeper. His older brother Trenton is a hair over his mid-20s and an assistant for the Central boys.<br />
<br />
These weeks get awfully quiet when Trenton returns home for a visit.<br />
<br />
&#8220;He&#8217;ll come over for dinners and stuff, but I don&#8217;t really talk to him,&#8221; Colby said with a grin. &#8220;I try and stay down in my room for a while and not talk to him when we&#8217;re getting ready to play Central.&#8221;</p>

				<h3><a href="http://blogs.wyomingnews.com/blogs/sports/2010/04/06/leonhardt-hired-to-coach-cheyenne-central-wrestling-team/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Leonhardt hired to coach Cheyenne Central wrestling team" class="h3">Leonhardt hired to coach Cheyenne Central wrestling team</a></h3> 
				<p>Cheyenne Central’s transition between wrestling coaches should be relatively seamless.<br />
<br />
Bryce Leonhardt, who has been an assistant with the Indians the past four seasons, was hired to re-place fifth-year coach T.J. Castillon on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Castillon resigned to become the physical education department chair at Cheyenne South, which opens this fall.<br />
<br />
Leonhardt, 26, lettered in wrestling at the University of Wyoming from 2003-06 and went 2-2 in his lone trip to the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships as a senior.<br />
<br />
Central captured third in Class 4A this past season with three athletes winning state titles. The Indians have placed no worse than fifth the past three seasons after failing to crack the top 10 of the 12-team event from 2002-07.<br />
