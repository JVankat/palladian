&nbsp;<br />
Annual Film Exhibitions to Include New Discoveries, Recoveries and Restorations <br />
&nbsp;<br />
NEW YORK, September 10, 2010&mdash;&nbsp; The Museum of Modern Art and ArteEast launch <b>Mapping Subjectivity: Experimentation in Arab Cinema, 1960s &ndash; Now</b>, a three-year program of annual screenings of groundbreaking films and videos, celebrated masterworks, and modern cinema from Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Morocco, Syria and more, beginning this fall.&nbsp; This in-depth initiative aims to map the largely unknown heritage of personal, artistic, and innovative cinema from the Arab world. In the 1960s, galvanized by a broader global vanguard of countercultural experimentation in the arts, filmmakers in these countries began to craft a language and form that broke away from established conventions and commercial considerations, ultimately clearing the ground for boldly subjective cinematic expressions.&nbsp; The Museum will screen each annual exhibition at the Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters and selections of the program will travel to the Abu Dhabi Film Festival and Tate Modern in London, and subsequently tour throughout the Middle East and internationally.&nbsp; <b>Mapping Subjectivity</b> is a collaboration between The Museum of Modern Art and ArteEast, and is organized by Jytte Jensen, Curator, Department of Film, The Museum of Modern Art, and Rasha Salti, Curator and Artistic Director, ArteEast.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Much of the daring and formally challenging filmmaking at work today in the Arab world has its roots&mdash;both acknowledged and not&mdash;in this pioneering drive to experiment with narrative, representation, and the production of images,&rdquo; says Ms. Jensen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Together, these films are sure to inspire new ways of thinking about and appreciating modernity in art and cinema from the Arab world.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Three years of research have gone into making this program possible,&rdquo; says Rasha Salti, who is also a programmer at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will not only instigate a re-writing of film history, but give contemporary and emerging filmmakers the strength to continue in taking risks, artistically and politically.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The first installment of Mapping Subjectivity, October 28 through November 22, 2010, is organized in clusters that reflect thematic and aesthetic kinship rather than considerations of chronology and geography, highlighting intangible connections and conversations among the selected works. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The October 28 opening night screening is acclaimed director Elia Suleiman&rsquo;s <b><i>Al Zaman al Baqi (Time that Remains)</i></b> (Palestine/Great Britain/Italy/Belgium/France, 2009), slated for release later this year by IFC Films.&nbsp; Suleiman will introduce this insightful and at times heartbreaking film, which is set among the Israeli Palestinian community and was inspired by his father&rsquo;s diaries, and letters which his mother had sent to family members who had fled the Israeli occupation.&nbsp; Suleiman will also introduce his two earlier films in the trilogy, <i><b>Segell Ikhtifa&rsquo; (Chronicle of a Disappearance)</b></i> (Palestine/France/USA/Germany/Israel, 1996) and Yadon ilaheyya (Divine Intervention) (Palestine/France/Morocco, 2002), the following day, marking the first time the trilogy will be seen in its entirety. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Highlights include a number of films that had been lost or forgotten, as was the case with <b><i>Sayf Sab&lsquo;een (Summer 70)</i></b> (Egypt/Italy, 1972), the radically experimental first and only film by Naji Shaker and Paolo Isaja. A meditation on freedom at the turn of the 1960s that uses the full vocabulary of experimental filmmaking, it has gone virtually unseen for the past 20 years, and only now has been rediscovered and restored specifically for this program by averda, a leading environmental services company in the Middle East, as a gift to MoMA&rsquo;s collection.&nbsp; Other rarities include <i><b>Qays al-Zubaidi&rsquo;s Al-Yazerli</b></i> (Iraq/Syria, 1972), a film that explores a young boy&rsquo;s inner turmoil at the prospect of a destiny that seems bound to poverty and manual labor and was screened only once in Syria, where it was filmed; <i><b>El-Chergui, al-Samt al-&lsquo;Aneef (The East Wind or The Violent Silence) </b></i>(Morocco, 1975) considered a classic and recently restored by the Centre Cin&eacute;matographique Marocain; and <b><i>Al-Moumia&rsquo; (The Mummy/Night of Counting the Years)</i></b> (Egypt, 1973), the most famous of Egyptian auteur movies, directed by Shadi Abdel Salam and restored by the World Cinema Foundation and Cineteca di Bologna.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Two new works, with funding and support provided by the Abu Dhabi Film Festival, Maher Abi Samra&rsquo;s <i><b>Sheoeyin Kenna (We Were Communists) </b></i>(Lebanon, 2009) and <b><i>Mina&rsquo; al-Thakira (Port of Memory)</i></b> (Palestine/Germany/France/UAE, 2009), written and directed by Kamal Aljafari, follow in the footsteps of their predecessors, pushing the boundaries of filmmaking both artistically and in terms of subject matter. Each director will introduce his film.<br />
<br />
Mapping Subjectivity features a number of pioneering women directors and artists, including Hala Alabdalla <i><b>(with Ammar el-Beik)</b></i>, whose film <i><b>Ana Alati Tahmol Azouhour Ila Qabriha (I Am the One Who Brings Flowers to Her Grave)</b></i> (Syria/France, 2006) follows three Syrian women, and ultimately creates a moving and formally inventive monument to humankind&rsquo;s resilience in the face of loss, exile, and death.&nbsp; <i><b>Domestic Tourism II</b></i> (Egypt, 2009), by rising director and artist Maha Maamoun, who will introduce her film, explores the ways in which iconic, historical monuments in Egypt are re-appropriated from the timelessness of the tourist postcard; and Joana Hadjithomas, an artist and director whose film<i><b> Yawmon Akhar (A Perfect Day)</b></i> (Lebanon/France, 2005), co-written and directed with Khalil Joreige, looks at a mother and son coming to terms with the disappearance of their husband and father.<br />
<br />
Mapping Subjectivity will include two Modern Mondays, weekly programming by MoMA which brings contemporary, innovative film and moving-image works to the public and provides a forum for viewers to engage in dialogue and debate with contemporary filmmakers and artists.&nbsp;&nbsp; The November 1 Modern Monday will feature Hala Alabdalla and Omar Amiralay; November 15 will feature Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This exhibition has been co-organized by The Museum of Modern Art and ArteEast. It is curated by Jytte Jensen, Curator, Department of Film, MoMA, and Rasha Salti, Curator and Artistic Director, ArteEast. It is made possible through the generous support of averda. The program is organized in association with the Abu Dhabi Film Festival. Additional support has been provided by the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the United States. ArteEast receives additional funding from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, and New York City&rsquo;s Department of Cultural Affairs.<br />

October 28 &ndash; November 22, 2010<br />
<br />
<b>Thursday, October 28<br />
</b>&nbsp;<br />
<b>7:00 p.m.<br />
</b><i><b>Irtebak (Awkward). 2007. Palestine/France. Directed by Elia Suleiman. With Leonid Alexeenko.<br />
</b></i>This is an extended cut of Suleiman&rsquo;s segment from the omnibus film Chacun son cin&eacute;ma (To Each His Own Cinema), which was commissioned by the Cannes International Film Festival to explore different directors&rsquo; feelings about cinema. In Arabic; English subtitles. 7 min.<br />
<br />
Al Zaman al Baqi (The Time That Remains). 2009. Palestine/Great Britain/Italy/Belgium/France. Written and directed by Elia Suleiman. With Saleh Bakri, Tarek Qubti, Suleiman.<br />
Subtitled &ldquo;Chronicle of a Present Absentee,&rdquo; this humorous, heartbreaking film (the final installment in a trilogy) is set among the Israeli Arab community and shot largely in homes and places in which Suleiman&rsquo;s family once lived. Inspired by his father&rsquo;s diaries, letters his mother sent to family members who had fled the Israeli occupation, and the director&rsquo;s own recollections, the film spans from 1948 until the present, recounting the saga of Suleiman&rsquo;s family in elegantly stylized episodes. Inserting himself as a silent observer reminiscent of Buster Keaton, Suleiman trains a keen eye on the absurdities of life in Nazareth. Print courtesy IFC Films. In Arabic, Hebrew; English subtitles. 109 min. Introduced by Suleiman. <br />
<br />
<b>Friday, October 29<br />
</b>&nbsp;<br />
<b>4:30 p.m.<br />
</b><i><b>Segell Ikhtifa&rsquo; (Chronicle of a Disappearance). 1996. Palestine/France/USA/Germany/Israel. Written and directed by Elia Suleiman. With Suleiman, Ola Tabari, Jamal Daher. <br />
</b></i>Suleiman&rsquo;s acclaimed directorial debut is a meditative search for what it means to be Palestinian. Constructed as a series of witty vignettes, some contemplative, others laced with satirical humor, the film expresses Suleiman&rsquo;s emotions and state of mind as he observes daily life in Nazareth, Jerusalem, and outlying areas. The director leads us on an evocative journey from an apartment in West Jerusalem to a Holy Land souvenir shop to a group of old women gossiping about their relatives. Print courtesy International Film Circuit. In Arabic, Hebrew; English subtitles. 88 min. Introduced by Suleiman.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>7:00 p.m.<br />
</b><i><b>Yadon ilaheyya (Divine Intervention). 2002. Palestine/France/Morocco. Written and directed by Elia Suleiman. With Suleiman, Emma Boltanski, Amer Daher. <br />
</b></i>Subtitled &ldquo;A Chronicle of Love and Pain,&rdquo; Divine Intervention follows several interrelated characters as they struggle to maintain the veneer of normal life in Nazareth, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. The film unfolds with a series of expertly executed fantasy sequences and sight gags depicting the absurd and even perverse manifestations of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict in everyday events. A man with a failing business (the director&rsquo;s father) takes matters into his own hands and tries to break a chain reaction of petty feuds, only to break down himself. The man&rsquo;s son, while caring for his ailing father, steals intimate moments with his lover in a deserted lot beside a checkpoint, from which they witness daily hostilities and quotidian feuds. Print courtesy Avatar. In Arabic, Hebrew; English subtitles. 92 min. Introduced by Suleiman. <br />
<br />
<b>Saturday, October 30<br />
</b>&nbsp;<br />
<b>2:00 p.m.<br />
</b><b><i>Cessez-le-Feu (Ceasefire). 2003. Algeria/France. Directed by Ahmed Zir.<br />
</i></b>When airplanes drop leaflets announcing a ceasefire ending the civil war, a young Algerian shepherd, too poor to afford schooling, becomes stubbornly determined to decipher the text. In Arabic; English subtitles. 15 min.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Abna&rsquo; el-Reeh (Sons of the Wind). 1981. Algeria. Directed by Brahim Tsaki. <br />
</b></i>Four almost wordless segments, poetic yet unsentimental, focus on people living in the countryside on the edge of society. Children playing, sudden bursts of wildness, grown-up faces lit by warming fires in winter&mdash;landscapes and the people they shape and (barely) sustain. 40 min. <br />
<br />
<b>4:00 p.m. <br />
</b>Al-Rajol al-Lathi Kan Yanzhor Ila al-Nawafith (The Man Who Was Looking at the Windows). 1986. Algeria. Directed by Merzak Allouache. With Fazia Chemloul, Allel El Mouhib, Hadj Smaine.<br />
The social and political frustrations of Algeria in the early 1980s are distilled into this tale of a quiet man whose mounting desperation leads him to rise up against a tyrant: his boss at the library. Allouache captures an era of despotism and the impotence of the common man through compelling visual imagery, including a surreal dream sequence with Weimar-period cabaret music that hauntingly illustrates the mood of political entrapment. Print courtesy CNC. In Arabic; English subtitles. 85 min. Introduced by Allouache. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<b>7:00 p.m.<br />
</b><i><b>Wa Laou fil Seen (La Chine est encore loin/China Is Still Far). 2008. Algeria/France. Directed by Malek Bensma&iuml;l.<br />
</b></i>On November 1, 1954, in a small village near Ghassira, nestled in the Aur&egrave;s mountains, two French teachers and an Algerian were the first civilian victims of the seven-year war for Algerian independence. Bensma&iuml;l returns to that village, &ldquo;the cradle of the Algerian revolution,&rdquo; to chronicle everyday lives in this symbolic place. The film might have easily become a meditation on regret, but in Bensma&iuml;l&rsquo;s masterful hands it bears the weight of the past while engaging profoundly with the present. Print courtesy Doc and Film International. In Arabic, Berber, French; English subtitles. 120 min.&nbsp; Introduced by Bensma&iuml;l. <br />
<br />
<b>Sunday, October 31<br />
</b>&nbsp;<br />
<b>2:00 p.m.<br />
</b><i><b>Al-Hobb al-Maw&rsquo;ood (Love Aborted). 1985. Syria/France. Directed by Omar Amiralay. <br />
</b></i>In the year leading up to a 1985 international conference on gender equality in Beijing, filmmakers throughout the world took part in an international series of documentary films exploring changing relationships between men and women. Amiralay, invited to explore the changing social and economic status of women in Egypt, chose his female protagonists from across classes&mdash;lawyers, actresses, domestic workers&mdash;and dared them to reveal the intricacies of their interior worlds. In Arabic; English subtitles. 52 min.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Massa&rsquo;ibu Qawmon&hellip;(The Misfortunes of Some&hellip;).1981.&nbsp; Syria/France/Lebanon. Directed by Omar Amiralay. <br />
</b></i>Hajj Ali makes a living as a taxi driver during the day, carrying citizens safely across the city, but he also runs a funeral home, waiting for &ldquo;customers&rdquo; to be delivered daily. As he documents one man&rsquo;s existence in civil war&ndash;ravaged Beiruit, Amiralay creats a tragicomic portrait of a society held captive by conflict. In Arabic; English subtitles. 52 min. Introduced by Amiralay.<br />
<br />
<b>5:00 p.m. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</b><i><b>Ana Alati Tahmol Azouhour Ila Qabriha. (I Am the One Who Brings Flowers to Her Grave).&nbsp; 2006.&nbsp; Syria/France.&nbsp;&nbsp; Written and directed by Hala Alabdalla&nbsp; and Ammar el-Beik.&nbsp; With Fadia Ladkani, Rola Roukbi, Raghida Assaf. <br />
</b></i>Conceived as a summation of life&rsquo;s postponed projects, this beautifully shot black-and-white film is a monument to humankind&rsquo;s great resilience and love of life in the face of loss, exile and death. Interviews with three Syrian women alternate with a variety of impressions: landscape, art, family, and an interview with painter and icon restorer Elias Zayyat. Part documentary, part fable, this is a well-crafted, highly emotional tribute to the rejuvenating power of poetry and beauty in general, and in particular to Da&lsquo;ad Haddad, a Syrian poet disappeared in 1991. In Arabic; English subtitles. 110 min. Introduced by Hala Alabdalla.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
