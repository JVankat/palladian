<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>WORLD leaders are descending on London, just as anti-capitalist protesters prepare to unfurl their banners. Barack Obama, who remains widely popular at home and abroad, met Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, on Wednesday April 1st. Mr Obama conceded that “We're not going to agree on every point”. On the eve of the G20 summit the two men should be concerned that too little is being done to respond to the worst economic slump since the 1930s. This week the OECD, for example, concluded that global output will shrink by 2.7% in 2009, sharply down on previous estimates.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>As worrying, the various leaders gathering in London are not agreed on how to sort out the economic mess. One risk is that the group, if it seeks consensus, will produce an anodyne statement that adds little or nothing to the existing efforts to respond to the global slump. A greater risk is that the summit is so badly divided, and the outcome is so feeble, that dashed expectations actually worsen confidence.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Broadly, the leaders are trying to tackle five sets of issues. The first, and perhaps least contentious, is the need to recapitalise banks and get credit flowing. All big countries with troubled banks have acted assertively on this. America, long the laggard, at last has a detailed plan that has been, mostly, well-received. Now it is a question of waiting to see whether and how the bail-outs, more lending and other initiatives will help to stimulate economies.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>But no consensus exists on the need for fiscal stimulus. Just how much governments of rich countries should borrow and spend to boost their economies is disputed. America would like them to commit to stimulus packages of 2% of GDP for this year and again for 2010. But Germany and France disagree vehemently. They argue that their economies rely much more on what are known as “automatic stabilisers”—tools such as unemployment insurance payments, which increase automatically in a recession—thus they do not need as much discretionary stimulus spending as countries, such as America, where welfare payments are much less generous. Deep differences remain. On Tuesday the Japanese prime minister, Taro Aso, said that Germany’s reluctance to use public spending aggressively stemmed from its lack of understanding of the importance of fiscal mobilisation. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>A failure to agree on co-ordinating fiscal plans opens the door to forms of protectionism in stimulus packages motivated by worries about stimulus benefits “leaking” abroad. Such policies could complicate the G20’s efforts to come up with ways to deal with what is already the biggest collapse in trade since the second world war. That collapse is not the result of countries imposing tariffs or devaluing currencies, as happened in the 1930s. Still, the World Bank has tracked the actions of the G20 countries in recent months and found that 17 have taken steps that retard trade, often by subtle means. Thus the leaders in London need to commit to much more than a vague promise to resist protectionism. Ideally, they will lay out a comprehensive list of measures going beyond tariffs and export subsidies—to include, for example, domestic subsidies and discriminatory procurement provisions in stimulus packages—and commit to not use them even where permitted by their existing international trade commitments. A general commitment to free trade, though welcome, would not suffice.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>On financial regulation, transatlantic differences have narrowed, with America agreeing to broaden its scope to encompass institutions such as hedge funds. But open disagreement remains possible. Mr Sarkozy’s reported threat to “get up and leave” rather than endorse a G20 statement that promises too little on regulating financial markets could make it all the harder to get a deal on fiscal stimulus. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>The last big issue for the G20 is what to do about the dramatic collapse in financial flows to developing and emerging economies, the largest of which are represented in the group. The least contentious part of the response is likely to be commitments to meet aid budgets and support more lending by institutions such as the World Bank and the regional development banks, possibly through greater rich-country lending to these institutions. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>More fraught, though within reach, are efforts to augment the resources of the IMF and to get the fund to deploy this money rapidly, something which emerging ones are ambivalent about. Success will probably involve getting China to offer to lend the IMF a large sum of money from its massive reserves. But this is unlikely without at least a clear promise of more say in running the fund, hitherto an institution dominated by Europe and America. Reform of the fund will mean giving emerging members more vote shares. Inclusion as part of the Financial Stability Forum, a group of regulators and central bankers charged with the technicalities of financial supervision, may also make them more willing to support an expansion of the fund. But China and other large emerging economies want more than incremental reform. Aware of the complexity of negotiating far-reaching changes to vote shares at the IMF, they would like interim measures demonstrating good faith, such as a commitment to let the leadership of the fund to be decided “irrespective of nationality”. But this is something that G20 finance ministers failed to endorse at a meeting in March.</FONT></P><BR clear=all> </div>

<DIV>Mar 26th 2009 <BR>From The Economist print edition</DIV></FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1><B>Are America’s banks prepared to sell their toxic assets?</B></FONT><BR><!--back-->
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>AMERICA’S government is a willing buyer of bad assets, but are its banks willing sellers? If a lender flogs a loan or security for less than the value at which it is booked on its balance-sheet, it suffers a loss, depleting its capital. It follows that if banks’ carrying values are still above those that state-sponsored bidders want to pay, they will not sell voluntarily.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Just how optimistic are banks’ books? Two-thirds of the Treasury scheme’s purchasing power will be directed towards legacy loans. America’s ten biggest banks had plenty of these—$3.6 trillion at the end of 2008, or about a third of their assets. However by global convention loans are not marked to market, but carried at cost and impaired gradually. Some categories of risky loans, for example to private-equity firms, have been written down. But the vast majority of loans have not. In aggregate the carrying value of the top-ten banks’ loan books was 3% above the market price in December. That gap may not seem much, but it amounts to over $110 billion; if it were crystallised, it would wipe out a quarter of these banks’ tangible common equity, their purest form of capital. The loss is also likely to be concentrated on the dodgiest loans, making them hard to sell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>The remainder of the scheme’s firepower will be directed at securities, which at $3.7 trillion comprise another third of the top-ten banks’ assets. These are marked to market and have been the main source of the savage write-downs that banks have suffered.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Many fear that banks are still being over-optimistic about their nastiest assets. For the top ten banks, 16% of securities were classified as “Level 3”, equivalent to 1.5 times their equity (see chart). Level 3 means there are no reliable market prices available, leaving the banks free to use models. The assumptions in these may not be particularly pessimistic: at the end of 2008, $12 billion of Citigroup’s Level 3 structured-credit exposures were valued according to a fall in house prices of 33% from the peak—a smaller drop than the one in the government’s own “stress test”. Those banks with the least capital probably have more generous valuations. And the scheme will buy only securities that originally had an AAA credit rating, which rules out the nastiest stuff.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>That still leaves about $3 trillion of securities that are marked to market using more reliable direct or indirect price inputs. But banks may be reluctant to sell their loans and their most toxic securities—exactly what the scheme is meant to target. The obvious remedy is to force banks to write down their assets further as part of the governments’ continuing stress tests. But with capital ratios tight and the Treasury’s bail-out kitty now almost depleted, that could push several big banks towards insolvency. </FONT></P><BR clear=all> </div>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>SIR – Your article about “emerging-market contagion” ranked countries according to their vulnerability to the global credit-crunch (<A href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13184631">Economics focus</A>, February 28th). But you did not reflect the actual situation of the Korean economy. The article portrayed South Korea as the joint third-riskiest among the countries surveyed, citing “large short-term foreign debts and highly leveraged banks”. This is simply not the case.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Let me provide you with accurate figures. South Korea’s short-term external debt is 75% of its foreign-exchange reserves and it continues to decline.

At the end of December this was 96%. The figure of 75% includes only liabilities with an original maturity of up to one year; it excludes maturing long-term debt. Our loan-to-deposit ratio covered all commercial and specialised banks and excluded certificates of deposits, the same definition used for all the countries we surveyed.

<P class=inputdate>기사입력 2009-03-09 오전 10:14:54<BR><BR>한국 정부가 영국 주간지 &lt;이코노미스트&gt; 본사를 직접 방문할 예정이다. 이 신문이 한국의 위기상황을 설명한 통계자료를 둔 양자의 신경전이 극히 이례적인 사태로 이어지는 양상이다.<BR><BR>8일 기획재정부는 보도해명자료를 내고 "내주 중 재정부와 금융위원회가 함께 &lt;이코노미스트&gt; 본사를 방문해 (정부측 입장을) 재차 설명할 계획"이라고 밝혔다. 이창용 금융위 부위원장과 김윤경 재정부 국제금융과장이 방문할 것으로 알려졌다.<BR><BR>정부가 이처럼 초강경 대응에 나서게 된 이유는 지난 달 26일 &lt;이코노미스트&gt;가 'Domino Theory'라는 기사에서 한국을 신흥시장(이머징 마켓) 중 경제위기에 세 번째로 취약한 나라로 설명했기 때문이다.<BR><BR>당시 &lt;이코노미스트&gt;는 "한국의 단기외채 비율은 외환보유고 감소에 따라 올해 안에 100%를 넘어설 것(전망치 102%)이며 예금자산 대비 대출자산의 비율(예대율)은 130%로 전망돼 자금상환 압박이 높아질 것"이라며 한국을 남아프리카공화국, 헝가리에 이어 가장 경제 사정이 취약한 국가로 분류했다.<BR><BR>이와 같은 기사가 보도되자 재정부는 즉시 반박자료를 내고 &lt;이코노미스트&gt;가 인용한 통계가 한국 현실을 제대로 반영한 것이 아니라고 주장했다. 재정부는 "외환보유액 대비 한국의 단기외채는 75% 수준이며 이마저도 감소 추세를 보이고 있다. 은행의 평균 예대율도 지난해 말 기준 118%며 6월 이후 지속적으로 줄어들고 있다"고 해명했다.<BR><BR>그러나 &lt;이코노미스트&gt;는 지난 5일자에 실린 'Opinion Letters'에 정부측 반론을 게재하는 한편, 비슷한 분량으로 편집자 주석(editor's note)을 함께 실어 정부 반박을 재반박하고 나섰다.<BR><BR>&lt;이코노미스트&gt;는 "외환보유액 대비 102%라는 단기외채 비율은 1년 이내에 만기가 도래하는 장기외채를 포함한 유동외채 개념으로 지난해 말 기준으로 96%였으며 이는 국제통화기금(IMF)에서 사용하는 방식"이라고 강조했다.<BR><BR>예대율과 관련해서도 "은행권 예대율을 산정하면서 모든 상업은행과 특수은행을 포함했고 양도성예금증서(CD)는 제외했다"며 "이는 모든 국가에 대해 똑같이 적용한 것이다. 한국은행이 밝힌 은행권 예대율도 지난해 12월 말 기준으로 136%에 달한다"고 주장했다.<BR><BR>이처럼 양자의 주장이 첨예하게 엇갈린 가운데 재정부는 &lt;이코노미스트&gt; 본사 방문에 앞서 다시 한 번 해명자료를 내 "처음 &lt;이코노미스트&gt;가 인용한 HSBC 원본 리서치보고서의 한국 외채 인용 수치는 유동외채가 아닌 단기외채 수치며 국제기준 상 외환보유액 대비 유동외채 비율이 100%를 초과하는지 여부는 매우 중요한 의미를 가진다는 사실을 직접 본사를 방문해 설명할 예정"이라고 전했다.

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>THE drought of foreign capital is beginning to wreck many economies in central and eastern Europe. Currencies, shares and bonds are tumbling, and some economists fear that one or more of these countries could default on its foreign debts. Emerging-market crises have a nasty habit of spreading as investors flee one country after another. Some Middle Eastern markets, notably Dubai, are already in trouble. But which of the larger emerging economies are most vulnerable?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>To answer that question <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">in the past, economists used to pay most attention to the solvency of governments, and hence their debt-to-GDP ratios. But today, the biggest risk in the emerging world comes not from sovereign borrowing, but from the debts of firms and banks. As foreign capital dries up, they will find it harder to refinance maturing debts or to raise new loans. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Our table (based largely on figures provided by HSBC) uses three indicators to judge how vulnerable economies are to the global credit crunch. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">The first is the expected current-account balance for this year.</FONT> Large deficits need to be financed, but banking and portfolio inflows are now scarce, and even foreign direct investment, which used to be seen as less volatile, has fallen sharply this year. Many of the smaller east European economies had double-digit deficits as a share of GDP in 2008, although deep recessions will reduce them this year. Among the countries in the table, Pakistan, South Africa and Poland are tipped to run current-account deficits of 8% or more of GDP this year—the size of Thailand’s deficit before its crisis in 1997.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>As well as financing a current-account shortfall, a country has to repay or roll over existing debts. If external finance is not available, it must run down its reserves. Thus a <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">useful measure of financing risk is short-term debt (due within 12 months) as a percentage of foreign-exchange reserves.</FONT> Anything above 100%, implying that debts exceed foreign exchange, should ring alarm bells. (At the start of 1997 Thailand’s short-term debt was 130% of its reserves.) The ratio is estimated at over 250% in both Latvia and Estonia, but in all the larger emerging economies it is below 100%. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">However, HSBC forecasts that South Korea’s short-term debt will exceed its shrinking reserves before the year is out. </FONT>The reserve cover in Indonesia, South Africa and Hungary is also looking thin. Russia’s reserves have plunged by more than one-third as the central bank has tried to prop up the rouble, but it still has a comfortable cushion.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">The third indicator, the ratio of banks’ loans to their deposits, is one measure of the vulnerability of banking systems. </FONT>When the ratio is over 1.0 (as in, say, Russia, Brazil, South Korea and Hungary), it means that the banks depend on borrowing, often from abroad, to finance domestic lending and so will be squeezed by the global credit crunch. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>To get an overall sense of financial vulnerability we have ranked all the countries on each of the three measures and then taken their average score. If all emerging economies were included, the smaller east Europeans, such as Latvia, Ukraine and Romania, would dominate the top of the risk league. Among the 17 larger economies shown in the table, South Africa and Hungary look the most risky; China the least. Hungary has already had to go cap in hand to the IMF for a loan. South Africa may yet have to. Despite higher gold prices, weaker mineral exports are causing its current-account deficit to swell, possibly to more than 10% of GDP this year, at the same time as net foreign direct investment is expected to slump, so the country needs to borrow even more. The rand, which has already fallen sharply, remains one of the most vulnerable emerging-market currencies.</FONT></P><BR>
<DIV><FONT face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><B><A name=not_again>Not again</A></B></FONT></DIV>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>In contrast, the Asian emerging markets generally look the safest, taking all six slots at the bottom of the table. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">The main exception is South Korea, which, thanks to its large short-term foreign debts and highly leveraged banks, is deemed to be as risky as Poland. (Vietnam, though not included in the table, also scores high on the risk rating). South Korea is in much healthier shape than during the 1997-98 crisis. For example, it is expected to move back to a small current-account surplus this year and its reserves are much larger. But its banks and its currency still look vulnerable. The won has already fallen by almost 40% against the dollar over the past year, swelling the local-currency value of its foreign debts. Increased financial jitters in east Europe could make it harder for South Korea to roll over the $194 billion debt which falls due this year. But currency-swap agreements with America, Japan and China will give it plenty of firepower to draw on. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>The overall score in the table only ranks countries’ relative risks. To assess the absolute risk of a crisis you need to estimate external-financing needs (defined as the sum of the current-account balance and the stock of short-term debt) over the next 12 months. Jonathan Anderson, at UBS, has calculated the gap between this and the stock of foreign-exchange reserves for 45 countries. The good news is that only 16 of them have a financing “gap”; in all the others, reserves are more than sufficient to cover a year’s worth of payments, even if there were no new capital inflows. Virtually all of those 16 countries are in central and eastern Europe. They include only two large emerging economies from outside the region: Pakistan, which already has an IMF programme, and South Africa.<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"> By contrast, South Korea should not have a financing gap, thanks to its expected move back into current-account surplus. </FONT>Most emerging economies’ large reserves will help to keep them out of danger. Unfortunately, the longer that the credit crunch continues, the more those reserves will start to dwindle. </FONT></P><BR clear=all> </div>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>$0.00, not counting fuel and handling: that is the cheapest quote right now if you want to ship a container from southern China to Europe. Back in the summer of 2007 the shipper would have charged $1,400. Half-empty freighters are just one sign of a worldwide collapse in manufacturing. In Germany December’s machine-tool orders were 40% lower than a year earlier. Half of China’s 9,000 or so toy exporters have gone bust. Taiwan’s shipments of notebook computers fell by a third in the month of January. The number of cars being assembled in America was 60% below January 2008.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>The destructive global power of the financial crisis became clear last year. The immensity of the manufacturing crisis is still sinking in, largely because it is seen in national terms—indeed, often nationalistic ones. In fact manufacturing is also caught up in a global whirlwind.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Industrial production fell in the latest three months by 3.6% and 4.4% respectively in America and Britain (equivalent to annual declines of 13.8% and 16.4%). Some locals blame that on Wall Street and the City. But the collapse is much worse in countries more dependent on manufacturing exports, which have come to rely on consumers in debtor countries. Germany’s industrial production in the fourth quarter fell by 6.8%; Taiwan’s by 21.7%; Japan’s by 12%—which helps to explain why GDP is falling even faster there than it did in the early 1990s (see <A href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13145077">article</A>). Industrial production is volatile, but the world has not seen a contraction like this since the first oil shock in the 1970s—and even that was not so widespread. Industry is collapsing in eastern Europe, as it is in Brazil, Malaysia and Turkey. Thousands of factories in southern China are now abandoned. Their workers went home to the countryside for the new year in January. Millions never came back (see <A href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13145129">article</A>).</FONT></P><BR>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Having bailed out the financial system, governments are now being called on to save industry, too. Next to scheming bankers, factory workers look positively deserving. Manufacturing is still a big employer and it tends to be a very visible one, concentrated in places like Detroit, Stuttgart and Guangzhou. The failure of a famous manufacturer like General Motors (GM) would be a severe blow to people’s faith in their own prospects when a lack of confidence is already dragging down the economy. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">So surely it is right to give industry special support? </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">Despite manufacturing’s woes, the answer is no.</FONT> There are no painless choices, but industrial aid suffers from two big drawbacks. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">One is that government programmes, which are slow to design and amend, are too cumbersome to deal with the varied, constantly changing difficulties of the world’s manufacturing industries.</FONT> Part <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff">of the problem has been a drying-up of trade finance. Nobody knows how long that will last. Another part has come as firms have run down their inventories (in China some of these were stockpiles amassed before the Beijing Olympics). The inventory effect should be temporary, but, again, nobody knows how big or lasting it will be.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">The other drawback is that sectoral aid does not address the underlying cause of the crisis—a fall in demand, not just for manufactured goods, but for </FONT><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">everything. Because there is too much capacity (far too much in the car industry), some businesses must close however much aid the government pumps in. </FONT>How can governments know which firms to save or the “right” size of any industry? That is for consumers to decide. Giving money to the industries with the loudest voices and cleverest lobbyists would be unjust and wasteful. Shifting demand to the fortunate sector that has won aid from the unfortunate one that has not will only exacerbate the upheaval. One country’s preference for a given industry risks provoking a protectionist backlash abroad and will slow the long-run growth rate at home by locking up resources in inefficient firms. </FONT></P><BR>
<DIV><FONT face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><B><A name=nothing_to_lose_but_their_supply_chains>Nothing to lose but their supply chains</A></B></FONT></DIV>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Some say that manufacturing is special, because the rest of the economy depends on it. In fact, the economy is more like a network in which everything is connected to everything else, and in which every producer is also a consumer. The important distinction is not between manufacturing and services, but between productive and unproductive jobs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Some manufacturers accept that, but proceed immediately to another argument: that the current crisis is needlessly endangering productive, highly skilled manufacturing jobs. Nowadays each link in the supply chain depends on all the others. Carmakers cite GM’s new Camaro, threatened after a firm that makes moulded-plastic parts went bankrupt. The car industry argues that the loss of GM itself would permanently wreck the North American supply chain (see <A href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13145718">article</A>). Aid, they say, can save good firms to fight another day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Although some supply chains have choke points, that is a weak general argument for sectoral aid. As a rule, suppliers with several customers, and customers with several suppliers, should be more resilient than if they were a dependent captive of a large group. The evidence from China is that today’s lack of demand creates the spare capacity that allows customers to find a new supplier quickly if theirs goes out of business. When that is hard, because a parts supplier is highly specialised, say, good management is likely to be more effective than state aid. The best firms monitor their vital suppliers closely and buy parts from more than one source, even if it costs money. In the extreme, firms can support vulnerable suppliers by helping them raise cash or by investing in them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">If sectoral aid is wasteful, why then save the banking system? Not for the sake of the bankers, certainly; nor because state aid will create an efficient financial industry. Even flawed bank rescues and stimulus plans, like the one Barack Obama signed into law this week, are aimed at the roots of the economy’s problems: saving the banks, no matter how undeserving they are, is supposed to keep finance flowing to all firms; fiscal stimulus is supposed to lift demand across the board.</FONT> As manufacturing collapses, governments should not fiddle with sectoral plans. Their proper task is broader but no less urgent: to get on with spending and with freeing up finance. <BR><BR></FONT></P> </div>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>THERE was <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff">a chance that this week would mark a turning-point in an ever-deepening global slump, as Barack Obama produced the two main parts of his rescue plan. The first, and most argued-over, was a big fiscal boost. After a lot of bickering in Congress a final compromise stimulus bill, worth $789 billion, seemed to have been agreed on February 11th; it should be only days away from becoming law. The second, and more important, part of the rescue was team Obama’s scheme for fixing the financial mess, laid out in a speech on February 10th by Tim Geithner, the treasury secretary. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>America cannot rescue the world economy alone. But this double offensive by its biggest economy could potentially have broken the spiral of uncertainty and gloom that is gripping investors, producers and consumers across the globe.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Alas, that opportunity was squandered. Mr Obama ceded control of the stimulus to the fractious congressional Democrats, allowing a plan that should have had broad support from both parties to become a divisive partisan battle. More serious still was Mr Geithner’s financial-rescue blueprint which, though touted as a bold departure from the incrementalism and uncertainty that had plagued the Bush administration’s Wall Street fixes, in fact looked depressingly like his predecessors’ efforts: timid, incomplete and short on detail. Despite talk of trillion-dollar sums, stockmarkets tumbled. Far from boosting confidence, Mr Obama seems at sea.</FONT></P>
<P><BR><FONT face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><B><A name=toxic_tantrums,_contingent_chaos>Toxic tantrums, contingent chaos</A></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>The fiscal stimulus plan has some obvious flaws. Too much of the boost to demand is backloaded to 2010 and beyond. The compromise bill is larded with spending determined more by Democrat lawmakers’ pet projects than by the efficiency with which the economy will be boosted. And it contains “Buy American” clauses that, even in their watered-down version, send the wrong signal to trading partners. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>For all those shortcomings, the stimulus plan gets one big thing right. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">Given the pace at which demand is slumping, a big, and sustained, fiscal boost is vital for America’s economy. </FONT>This package, albeit imperfectly, administers it. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>That makes the inadequacy of the financial rescue all the more regrettable. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">Fiscal stimulus, indispensable as it is, cannot create a lasting economic recovery in a country with a broken financial system. The lesson of big banking busts, such as Japan’s in the 1990s, is that debt-laden balance-sheets must be restructured and troubled banks fixed before real recoveries can take off. History also suggests that countries which address their banking crises quickly and creatively (as Sweden did in the early 1990s) do better than those that </FONT><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">dither. This is expensive and painful, but cautious, penny-pinching governments end up paying more than those that tread boldly. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>By any recent historical standards America’s banking bust is big (see <A href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13110352">article</A>). The scale of troubled loans and the estimates of likely losses—which are now routinely put at over $2 trillion—suggest many of the country’s biggest banks may be insolvent. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">Their balance-sheets are clogged by hundreds of billions of dollars of “toxic” assets—the illiquid, complex and hard-to-price detritus of the mortgage bust, as well as growing numbers of non-housing loans that are souring thanks to the failing economy.</FONT> Worse, banks’ balance-sheets are only one component of the credit bust. Most of the tightness of credit is owing to <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">the collapse of “securitisation”, the packaging and selling of bundles of debts from credit cards to mortgages. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Fixing this mess will require guts, imagination and a lot of taxpayers’ money. Mr Geithner claims he knows this. “We believe that the policy response has to be comprehensive and forceful,” he declared in his speech, adding that “there is more risk and greater cost in gradualism than aggressive action.”</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>But his deeds did not live up to his words. His to-do list was dispiritingly inadequate on some of the thorniest problems, such as nationalising insolvent banks, dealing with toxic assets and failing mortgages. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">Mr Geithner promised to “stress-test” the big banks to see if they were adequately capitalised and offer “contingent” capital if they were not. But he offered few details about the terms of public-cash infusions or whether they would, eventually, imply government control.</FONT> His plan for a “public-private investment fund” to buy toxic assets was vague and its logic—that a nudge from government, in the form of cheap financing, would enliven a moribund market—was heroic. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">Banks’ balance-sheets are clogged with toxic junk precisely because they are unwilling to sell the stuff at prices hedge funds and other private investors are willing to pay. Vagueness, in turn, led to incoherence. How can you stress-test banks if you do not know how their troubled assets will be dealt with and at what price? </FONT>Amid these shortcomings were some good ideas, such as a fivefold expansion of a $200 billion fledgling Fed facility to boost securitisation. But for nervous investors and worried politicians, desperate for details and prices, the “plan” was a grave disappointment. <BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><B><A name=a_great_failure_of_nerve><BR>A great failure of nerve</A></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>How serious is this setback? One interpretation is that Mr Obama’s crew mismanaged expectations—that they promised a plan and came up with a concept. If so, that is a big mistake. Managing expectations is part of building confidence and when so much about these rescues is superhumanly complex, it is unforgivable to bungle the easy bit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>More worrying still is the chance that Mr Geithner’s vagueness comes from doubt about what to do, a reluctance to take tough decisions, and a timidity about asking Congress for enough cash. That is an alarming prospect. “Banksters” may be loathed everywhere (see <A href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13109560">article</A>), but more money will surely be needed to clean up America’s banks and administer the financial fix the economy needs. That, as this newspaper has argued before, means <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #e4e4e4">both some form of “bad bank” for toxic loans (with temporary nationalisation part of that cleansing process, if necessary) and guarantees to cover catastrophic losses in the “good” banks that remain</FONT>. Mr Obama’s team must recognise this or they, like their predecessors, will come to be seen as part of the problem, not the solution. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>IT SEEMS so unfair. Most Asian economies have been models of prudence. While American and European households were borrowing up to the hilt, Asian ones were tucking away their savings. While rich-country banks were piling into ever-riskier assets, Asian banks kept their holdings of such assets small. And while America and Britain were sucking up the world’s savings, Asian governments piled up vast stocks of foreign reserves. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Yet many of Asia’s tiger economies seem to have been hit harder than their spendthrift Western counterparts. In the fourth quarter of 2008, GDP probably fell by an average annualised rate of around 15% in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan; their exports slumped more than 50% at an annualised rate. Share prices in emerging Asia have plunged by almost as much as during the Asian financial crisis a decade ago. That crisis was caused by Asia’s excessive dependence on foreign capital. This time the tigers have been tripped up by their excessive dependence on exports. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Asia’s emerging economies have long been the world’s most dynamic, with GDP growing at an annual rate of 7.5% over the past decade, two and a half times as fast as the rest of the world. Only last summer, many of these countries were being warned by foreigners that they were growing too fast and needed to raise interest rates to prevent a surge in inflation. Now, many seem to be in free fall and the news is likely to get grimmer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>In the fourth quarter of 2008, real GDP fell by an annualised rate of 21% in South Korea and 17% in Singapore, leaving output in both countries 3-4% lower than a year earlier. Singapore’s government has admitted the economy may contract by as much as 5% this year, its deepest recession since independence in 1965. In comparison, China’s growth of 6.8% in the year to the fourth quarter sounds robust, but seasonally adjusted estimates suggest output stagnated during the last three months. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Asia’s richer giant, Japan, has yet to report its GDP figures, but exports fell by 35% in the 12 months to December. In the same period, Taiwan’s dropped by 42% and industrial production was down by a stunning 32%, worse than the biggest annual fall in America during the Depression. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Asia’s export-driven economies had benefited more than any other region from America’s consumer boom, so its manufacturers were bound to be hit hard by the sudden downward lurch. Asian exports are volatile anyway (see chart 1). And though the 13% fall in the region’s exports in the 12 months to December was slightly smaller than in 1998 or 2001, those dismal records seem certain to be beaten soon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>The plunge in exports has been exacerbated by the global credit crunch, which made it harder to get trade finance. Destocking on a huge scale has further slashed output. Trade within Asia has dropped by even more than the region’s sales to America or Europe. Exports to China from the rest of Asia were 27% lower in December than a year earlier, partly reflecting weaker demand for components for assembly into goods for re-export. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Shocking as the export figures are, they are not entirely to blame for Asia’s woes. A closer look at the numbers reveals that in most countries imports have fallen by even more than exports, and that weaker domestic demand explains a larger part of the slump. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>In China, for example, weaker domestic spending—mainly the result of a collapse in housing construction—accounted for more than half of the country’s slowdown in 2008. In South Korea, net exports actually made a positive contribution to GDP growth in the fourth quarter, while consumer spending and fixed investment fell at annualised rates of 18% and 31% respectively. South Korea is an exception to the rule of Asian prudence. Its households’ debt amounts to 150% of disposable income, even higher than in America. The banking system, which borrowed heavily abroad to finance a surge in domestic lending has also been badly hit by the global credit crunch, making it harder for firms to finance investment. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Domestic spending has collapsed elsewhere. Over the past 12 months, retail sales have fallen by 11% in Taiwan, 6% in Singapore and 3% in Hong Kong. As big financial centres, the two city-states have been battered by the global storm. Both have high levels of share ownership, so tumbling stockmarkets and property prices are depressing consumption. In Hong Kong average house prices have already fallen by almost 20% since the summer and Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, forecasts another 30% drop by the middle of 2010.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>A recent report by Frederic Neumann and Robert Prior-Wandesforde, two economists at HSBC, a large bank, argues that Asia is suffering two recessions: a domestic one as well as an external one. Domestic demand had been expected to cushion the blow of weaker exports, but instead it was hit by two forces. First, the surge in food and energy prices in the first half of 2008 squeezed companies’ profits and consumers’ purchasing power. Food and energy account for a larger portion of household budgets in Asia than in most other regions. Second, in several countries, including China, South Korea and Taiwan, tighter monetary policy intended to curb inflation choked domestic spending further. With hindsight, it appears that China’s credit restrictions to cool its property sector worked rather too well. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>The two recessions reinforced one another. Part of the slump in domestic spending is attributable to falling exports, which force firms to cut investment and lay off workers. This makes it hard to say whether domestic or external demand is more to blame for Asia’s distress. The importance of exports to the Asian miracle has long been controversial anyway. The crude figures show that, on average, emerging Asia’s exports amount to 47% of their GDP, up from 37% ten years ago. The share varies from 14% in India to 186% in Singapore (see chart 2). In Japan, which is often viewed as an export-driven economy, exports are only 16% of GDP. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>But this ratio overstates a country’s dependence on external demand if exports have a high import content. China’s exports account for 36% of GDP, but about half of them are “processing exports”, which contain a lot of imported components. Thus the impact on GDP growth of a fall in exports is partially offset if imports fall too. Estimates suggest that domestic value-added from Chinese exports is a more modest 18% of GDP.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>An alternative measure of the importance of exports is the change in net exports in real terms. Between 2002 and 2007 the increase in net exports contributed only 15% of real GDP growth in China. In contrast, net exports accounted for half of all growth in Singapore and Taiwan. This measure understates the total impact, though, because it ignores the spillover effects of exports on business confidence, investment, employment and consumer spending. Either way, the smaller economies, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, are heavily export-dependent; the giants, China and India, less so. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Asia’s recoveries from previous downturns have been led by a rebound in exports to the rich world. This is unlikely in the near future. The question is, might domestic demand now take up some of the slack? There are reasons to think so. Falling commodity prices are boosting consumers’ purchasing power, just as they squeezed it last year. More important is the impact of monetary and fiscal expansion.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>With the exceptions of South Korea and India, Asia has so far been spared the financial dislocations that are plaguing the West. The HSBC economists reckon that the region is more likely to suffer a credit pinch than a full-scale crunch. In contrast to America and Europe, where excessive debt could depress spending for years, most Asian households and firms (except in South Korea) have modest debts. And, because of healthier banking systems, Asian banks are less likely than Western ones to react to the crisis by refusing to lend. Hence interest-rate cuts and the easing of credit controls should be more potent than elsewhere. No less important is Asia’s massive fiscal pump-priming. This is also likely to be more effective than elsewhere because the private sector is in better shape and able to respond by spending more.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Asia has never before deployed its monetary and fiscal weapons with such force. Every country across the region has cut interest rates and announced a fiscal stimulus. In previous downturns, Asian governments were often constrained by dire public finances or the need to support currencies. But most countries entered this downturn with small budget deficits or even surpluses. All the main Asian emerging economies apart from India have relatively low ratios of public debt to GDP. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Though the true size of the fiscal stimulus in some countries, notably China, is probably less than the headline-grabbing figures suggest, they are still impressive. After correcting for double counting and unrealistic measures, China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan will all enjoy a fiscal stimulus of at least 3% of GDP in 2009. China has signalled that more measures may follow over the next couple of months; it can certainly afford to spend more. On January 22nd, Singapore’s government announced a package of measures equivalent to 8% of GDP. For the first time, this will be financed partly by dipping into the government’s vast reserves.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>The effectiveness of fiscal easing depends on its composition as well as its size. Income-tax cuts planned in South Korea and Taiwan will have only a modest impact if the money is saved not spent. Corporate tax cuts, planned in Singapore, may not spur investment when profits are plunging. Taiwan’s government is attempting to boost consumer spending by issuing shopping vouchers worth NT$3,600 ($107) per person. Economists are sceptical about whether this will produce new spending, but the scheme is being watched closely by other Asian governments.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>More promising is the fact that every country is planning to boost infrastructure spending. In the short term, this is probably the best way for governments to boost spending and jobs; in the longer term better roads and railways should boost productivity. Fiscal tightening in emerging Asia after the 1998 crisis caused governments to reduce capital spending; as a result, public infrastructure in some countries, notably Indonesia and Thailand, is probably worse than a decade ago. So there is plenty of room to spend more.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>If (still a big if) China and others fully implement their stimulus plans, domestic demand could start to recover in the second half of this year even if exports remain weak. Average growth in emerging Asia might fall to only 4-5% in 2009 as a whole, half its pace in 2007 and the slowest rate since the Asian financial crisis. But it would be well above the trough of 2.4% in 1998 (see chart 3). That average conceals a wide variation. The economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan will all contract this year, while the bigger, but less open economies of China, India and Indonesia should hold up better. </FONT></P><BR>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>However, Asian governments have more than this year’s growth rate to worry about. Beyond the immediate crisis, where will growth come from? America’s consumer boom and widening trade deficit, which powered much of Asia’s growth over the past decade, has come to an end. America’s return to thrift is unlikely to prove a cyclical blip. For years to come, Americans will have to save more and import less. Asia’s export-led growth therefore seems to have reached its limits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>It needs a new engine of growth: in future it must rely more on domestic demand, especially consumption. In recent years, it has been doing the opposite: consumer spending has fallen as a share of GDP, while the share of exports and investment has climbed (see chart 4). Two decades ago, consumer spending accounted for 58% of Asia’s GDP. By 2007 it had fallen to 47%. Consumer spending in China is just 36% of GDP, half the American share. An analysis by CLSA, a broking firm, finds that the weight of exports in GDP now exceeds that of private consumption in six of the 11 Asian countries it tracks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>So how can Asia lift consumption? That depends on why it has been declining in the first place. The popular explanation is that it is all because frugal households have been saving a bigger slice of their income in response to uncertainty over pensions and social welfare—uncertainty that will presumably increase in a recession. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>But this doesn’t quite fit the facts. In many countries, notably South Korea and Taiwan, household savings have fallen relative to income in the past decade; in China they have been broadly flat. (The rise in China’s savings rate comes from firms and the government, not households.) </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>If households are not saving more, why has consumer spending declined as a share of GDP? The answer is that wage incomes have fallen relative to GDP. In China the share of wages dropped from 53% in 1998 to 40% in 2007. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>One reason for this is that job creation has slowed as governments have encouraged capital-intensive industries. Across Asia, and particularly in China, low interest rates have encouraged investment and policies such as undervalued exchange rates and subsidies have favoured manufacturing over labour-intensive services. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>So if Asia is to shift the mix of growth towards consumption, the usual prescription of urging households to spend more will not be enough. A raft of government policies will have to change to lift households’ share of national income. They include: reducing the bias towards capital-intensive manufacturing; speeding up financial liberalisation to lift the cost of capital; scrapping subsidies and tax breaks which favour manufacturing over services; and attacking monopolies and other barriers to services. Stronger exchange rates would also shift growth away from exports and boost households’ real spending power by reducing the cost of imports in local currency terms.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>In contrast, some in China are foolishly calling for a devaluation of the yuan to support the economy. This would do little to bolster exports, which have been hurt by weak external demand rather than declining competitiveness, but would hinder the necessary economic adjustment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Even if household saving rates have been falling, they are still high, at around 20% in both China and Taiwan. This partly reflects the fact that younger populations tend to save more for retirement. An IMF study estimates that as populations age and retired workers run down their savings, this could push up consumption-to-GDP ratios in some countries by eight percentage points or more in the next decade.</FONT></P><BR>
<DIV><FONT face="verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif"><B><A name=clawing_it_back>Clawing it back</A></B></FONT></DIV>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Policy changes can also help nudge up saving rates. In poorly developed financial systems, households find it hard to borrow and so need to save for a rainy day. Easier access to credit could reduce such saving. But the recent credit boom and bust will make governments even more cautious about financial reform. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Inadequate social-welfare nets do encourage people to save. So higher public spending on health, education and welfare support could encourage households to save less and spend more. The recent news that China plans to spend 850 billion yuan ($125 billion) over the next three years to provide basic health care for at least 90% of the population by 2011 is therefore welcome. But the details are sketchy. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>After the Asian crisis, many foreigners were quick—too quick—to pronounce the regional miracle dead. Economies bounced back not just because of the appetite of American consumers, but also because Asia still had the key ingredients of growth: rising productivity; high savings to finance investment; low import barriers to spur competition. These will help Asia remain the fastest growing region in the world. But a bigger share of those gains needs to go to workers and consumers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif" size=-1>Asia’s low rate of consumption and borrowing means that it has huge scope to make consumption the engine of growth over the next decade. In previous downturns, Asians were forced to take nasty medicine. Having to go out and spend would surely make a nice change.</FONT></P><BR clear=all> </div>

가고 있다는 생각에 금융연구원을 떠나기로 결정하였습니다. <BR><BR>연구원을 정부의 Think Tank(두뇌)가 아니라 Mouth Tank(입) 정도로 생각하는 현 정부에게 연구의 자율성과 독립성은 한갓 사치품일 수밖에 없습니다. 정책실패의 원인을 정책의 오류에서 찾기보다는 홍보와 IR에서 찾는 현 정부의 상황 판단 앞에서, 잘된 것은 모두 내 탓이요 잘못된 것은 모두 네 탓이라고 보는 현 정부의 인식 앞에서, 결정은 내가 할테니 너희들은 그저 일사불란하게 따라오기만 하라는 현 정부의 일방통행식 밀어붙이기 사고방식 앞에서 정부 정책에 대한 비판은 비판의 잘 잘못을 따질 필요도 없이 현 정부의 갈 길을 가로막는 걸림돌에 불과할 것입니다. 아니, 비판이 아니더라도 정부의 정책을 앞장서서 적극적으로 홍보하지 않는 연구원이나 연구원장은 현 정부의 입장에서는 아마 제거되어야 할 존재인 것 같습니다. 경제성장률 예측치마저도 정치 변수화한 이 마당에 그것은 아마 당연한 일이겠지요. <BR><BR>돌이켜 보면 정부의 정책이 지금처럼 이념화된 적도 흔치는 않았던 것 같습니다. 정책의 논의 과정이 생략되고 사고와 아이디어의 다양성이 이처럼 철저히 무시된 적도, 아니 봉쇄된 적도 흔치는 않았던 것 같습니다. 적어도 우리 사회가 민주화된 이후에는 말입니다. 경제적 논리와 경험적 증거보다는 주의와 주장만 난무하는 무리한 정책, 네 편과 내 편을 가르는 정책, 모든 국민에게 골고루 혜택이 돌아가기보다는 특정 집단에게 혜택이 집중되는 정책, 그 앞에서 사고와 아이디어의 다양성이 인정될 수가 없겠지요. 이에 근거한 활발한 정책 토론 또한 불편하겠지요. <BR><BR>여러 가지 사례를 들 필요도 없습니다. 현 정부가 금과옥조처럼 여기는 금산분리 완화정책을 살펴봅시다. 재벌에게 은행을 주는 법률 개정안을 어떻게 ‘경제살리기 법’이라고 부를 수 있습니까. 어떻게 ‘개혁입법’이라고 부를 수 있습니까. 그것을 어떻게 국제적 조류라고 감히 주장할 수가 있습니까. 어떻게 우리나라가 전세계에 유래가 없을 정도로 금산분리가 가장 철저한 나라라고 주장할 수 있습니까. 정부의 주장과는 달리, 그리고 일부 보수집단 금융이론가들의 주장과는 달리 우리나라는 전세계 선진국에는 유래가 없을 정도로 산업자본의 금융지배가 가장 많이 허용된 나라입니다. 그 폐해도 가장 많이 경험한 나라입니다. <BR><BR>여러분들은 외국의 경우 은행이든 증권사든 보험회사든 산업자본의 지배 아래 있는 세계적 금융기관을 보신 적이 있습니까. 제가 과문해서 그런지 모르겠습니다만 저는 아직 산업자본의 지배 아래 있는 세계적 은행, 세계적 증권사, 세계적 보험사의 예를 듣지도 보지도 못했습니다. 그러나 우리나라의 경우에는 은행을 제외하면 증권, 보험 등 제2금융권의 주요회사들은 거의 대부분 산업자본 즉, 재벌의 지배 아래 있습니다. 이래도 저희 나라가 전세계에서 금융과 산업이 가장 철저히 분리된 나라라고 할 수 있겠습니까. 그리고 불행히도 재벌의 지배 아래 있는 우리나라의 증권사, 보험사들은 비록 국내시장에서는 1류 행세를 하지만 국제시장에서는 2류, 3류 수준에 불과한 실정입니다. 재벌의 소유를 금지했기 때문에 우리나라 증권사, 보험사가 세계시장에서 2류, 3류에 머물러 있는 것이 아닙니다. 이래도 재벌의 은행소유를 금지하고 있기 때문에 우리나라의 금융산업이 국제적인 수준으로 발전하지 못한다고 할 수 있습니까. 그렇게 주장하기 전에 우선 재벌들은 자기들이 소유한 증권사, 보험사를 국제경쟁력을 갖춘 글로벌 금융사로 만들어야 합니다. 그런 능력이 있다는 것을 보여야 합니다. 그렇지 않다면 은행을 재벌에 주어야 한다는 주장은 마치 프리메라 리그의 꼴찌 축구팀에게 야구를 하도록 해주면 월드시리즈 챔피언이 될 거라는 주장과 다르지 않습니다. 복잡하고 어려운 경제이론을 내세우기도 전에 이런 평범한 상식적 결론을 현 정부는 왜 진솔하게 인정하지 않는지 이해할 수 없습니다. 저희 연구원으로서는, 그리고 저 개인으로서도 -- 원장으로서 뿐만 아니라 금융학자로서 -- 정부의 금산분리 완화정책을 합리화할 수 있는 논거를 도저히 만들 재간이 없습니다. 정부의 적지 않은 압력과 요청에도 불구하고 말입니다. <BR><BR>재벌의 은행소유를 허용하는 은행법과 금융지주회사법 등 개정안은 금융분야에서의 대운하 정책과 다르지 않습니다. 한번 국토를 파헤치고 나면 파괴된 환경을 되돌릴 수 없듯이 일단 은행이 재벌의 사금고가 되면 이를 되돌릴 수가 없습니다. 환경파괴의 영향이 모든 국민에게 미치는 외부불경제성(external diseconomies)과 마찬가지로 은행의 사금고화도 금융체제 위험(systemic risk)을 높이는 외부불경제성을 갖고 있습니다. 일단 파괴된 환경은 사후 감독이나 제재로 쉽게 복구되지 않듯이 은행 사금고화의 폐해도 현 정부와 일부 보수 금융학자들의 주장과는 달리 사후 감독이나 제제를 강화한다고 쉽게 방지되거나 시정될 수 있는 것이 아닙니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 대운하 정책이나 금산분리 완화정책이 쉽게 포기되지 않는 이유는 아마도 그 혜택이 특정 집단에 집중되기 때문인 것 같습니다. 특정집단의 이익이 상식을 압도하는 상황이 벌어지고 있다고 밖에 달리 결론지을 수 없는 것 같습니다. 저는 잘 모르겠습니다만 4대강 정비사업이라는 명분으로 삽질을 하다가 나중에 슬쩍 연결하면 대운하가 된다고들 합니다. 재벌의 은행소유한도를 4%에서 10%로 올려 일단 발을 들여놓고 나서 나중에 슬쩍 조금만 더 풀어주면 되니까 이것도 닮은꼴입니다. <BR><BR>글로벌 금융위기를 우리의 경제위기로 키우고 있는 정부의 거듭된 오판과 실정이 또 다른 사례가 되겠지요. 전국민이 합심해서 글로벌 금융위기에 총력 대응해도 부족할 때입니다. 다양한 의견이 표출되고 진지한 논의를 거쳐 국민의 의지가 정책으로 결집되어야 할 때입니다. 정부는 허심탄회하게 귀를 열어야 할 때입니다. 그러나 좌-우, 진보-보수, 네 편-내 편, 네 탓-내 탓 가르기에 집착하다 보니 정부의 관심은 다른 데 있는 것 같아 보입니다. 정부는 다양한 의견의 자유로운 표출과 논의를 막고 싶은 것 같습니다. 위기상황에 대한 판단마저도 정책적으로 왜곡되고 수시로 번복되는 것 같습니다. 그래서 정책대응에도 실기를 하는 것 같습니다. 서로 상충되는 정책이 남발되는 것 같습니다. 위기는 점점 더 현실로 다가오는 것 같습니다. 그러니 국민들은 점점 더 어려워지고 정부에 대한 국민의 불신도 커지는 것 같습니다. <BR><BR>이럴 때일수록 연구원의 역할이 중요합니다. 연구의 자율성과 독립성이 그 어느 때보다 중요합니다. 이럴 때 연구원 동료 여러분의 곁을 떠나는 제 심정도 착잡하기 그지없습니다. 그러나 ‘법에 규정’된 원장의 임기를 부정하는 ‘법치’ 정부의 이중 잣대(double standard) 앞에서 연구의 자율성과 독립성을 보장해달라고 한들 무슨 소용이 있겠습니까. 연구의 자율성과 독립성을 위해 원장의 임기가 보장되어야 한다고 한들 무슨 소용이 있겠습니까. 그리고 연구의 자율성과 독립성을 희생하는 대가로 연구원의 원장직을 더 연명한다면 그것이 무슨 의미가 있겠습니까. 원장의 직은 제 개인의 영달을 위해 있는 것이 아니라 연구원의 발전을 위해 있는 것이기 때문입니다. <BR><BR>근래 돌아가는 세태를 보면서 제 후임으로 어떤 분이 오실까 궁금해지기도 합니다. 여러분들도 마찬가지겠지요. 어떤 분이 원장으로 오시든 여러분께서는 동요하지 마시고 조용히 연구에 매진해 주시기를 부탁드립니다. 제가 여러분께 누누이 말씀드렸듯이 연구원을 이끌어 나가는 것은 원장이 아니라 여러분 자신이라는 점을 한시도 잊지 마시기 바랍니다. 제가 원장으로 재임했던 기간 중에도 연구원을 이끌어 왔던 것은 제가 아니고 여러분이었습니다. 저는 단지 여러분을 도와드리는 역할만을 하였을 뿐입니다. <BR><BR>눈앞의 이익에 눈이 멀어 정부의 요구에 맹목적으로 따라서는 안됩니다. 금융연구원의 품격을 유지해야 합니다. 금융연구원에 대한 외부의 신망과 신뢰를 유지해야 합니다. 긴 세월을 두고 보면 그래야만 우리 금융연구원이 한 단계 더 발전할 수 있습니다. 그것이 우리가 국가와 국민에 보답하는 길입니다. <BR><BR>한동안 쉽지 않은 시절이 금융연구원에도 올 것입니다. 그러나 어느 시인이 말했습니다. 이 세상에 흔들리지 않고 피는 꽃은 없다고. 이 세상에 젖지 않고 피는 꽃은 없다고. 여러분이 겪는 어려움이 금융연구원의 꽃을 피우는 자양분이 될 것이라고 믿어 의심치 않습니다. <BR><BR>저는 비록 금융연구원을 떠나기는 하지만 동료 여러분을 아주 떠나는 것은 아닙니다. 뜻을 같이 하는 학자들이 한 평생을 같이 하듯 저는 여러분과 평생을 같이 할 것입니다. 여러분의 동료로서 또한 선배로서 저는 금융연구원을 떠나서도 금융연구원의 발전을 위해 여러분과 같이 노력할 것입니다. 금융연구원을 금융연구자들의 품으로 되찾을 때까지 ..... <BR><BR>2009년 1월 31일 <BR><BR>한국금융연구원 원장
