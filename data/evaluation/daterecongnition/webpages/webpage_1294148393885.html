			<div class="postBody"><p>By James Ong</p>
<p>Reproduced below is the text of my letter to Dr. Hariharan, after learning, with great surprise, that only two vaccines are really compulsory.  I am aware that when parents are enrolling their children into Primary One, the schools do check that the children have completed their vaccinations according to the National Childhood Immunisation Programme.  So, it&#8217;s getting complicated.  MoH says eight of the ten vaccines are not mandatory but MoE has the right, it appears, to refuse school enrolment for any child who did not complete all his vaccinations.  Does this mean that parents who refuse any or most of the other eight vaccines for their child have to home-school their kids or find a private school willing to take them?  There seems to be no justice in all this.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dear Dr. Hariharan,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thank you so much for your reply to my emails, on behalf of the Health Minister.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am quite relieved that the PCV-7 and many other childhood vaccines are not compulsory in Singapore. It has renewed my faith that the Ministry of Health honors parents’ right of medical freedom. As I have stated in my first email, the prevention (PCV-7) appears to be more dangerous than the disease itself, based on the clinical trials and US VAERS data.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>At the same time however, I am concerned that many parents in Singapore are not aware of their rights. Parents are routinely “coerced” into vaccinating their children according to the immunization schedule. I believe the general public is of the impression that they have to vaccinate their children with all the vaccines in the Childhood Immunization Program or risk certain repercussions.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I would like to offer the following feedback and suggestons which I hope the MoH will look into seriously:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>1. MoH should publicly clarify in the local newspapers and on its website and the HPB&#8217;s website that only two vaccines – measles and diphtheria – are compulsory by law; the rest are entirely voluntary.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>2. Parents should be made aware that they have a legal right to delay or postpone even compulsory vaccinations like measles and diphtheria. This can be covered in the same announcement stated in point one above.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3. Doctors, nurses and hospitals should not “coerce” or unduly influence parents into vaccinating their children with non-compulsory vaccines. I was told that newborns are not permitted to leave the hospital until the BCG and Hep B jabs are given. As far as I am aware, parents are hardly ever consulted whether they would agree to have their children vaccinated. The vaccines are just routinely given as if they were a must.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>4. MoH should ensure that there is no discrimination by publicly-run schools or kindergartens against children who have not been vaccinated with the non-compulsory vaccines. It is my understanding that the MoE requires all the recommended vaccinations to be completed before a child can be enrolled into Primary One. I hope that the MoH and MoE can work together to ensure that no child is discriminated against just because of incomplete adherence to the recommended childhood vaccination schedule.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>5. Parents should be given all the facts regarding the risks vs. benefits of each vaccine and asked to sign a consent form before the vaccine is given.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>6. After any vaccine is given, parents should be advised to observe their child for at least 30 days to see if there are any adverse reactions and notify the HSA immediately (with a hotline number given) by means of a formal reporting system and to seek medical help if necessary. This advisory should be in the form of a printed handout. An online notification system should also be developed as soon as possible to facilitate online reporting. Parents should also be advised as to their legal right to claim damages should there be a serious adverse reaction following vaccination. Who is responsible? The clinic, vaccine supplier or the MoH?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>7. Since only the measles and diphtheria vaccines are compulsory, MoH should ensure that single vaccines for measles and diphtheria are available at all polyclinics and private clinics, to meet the demand by parents for these single vaccines. I feel that parents should not be forced to have their children vaccinated with 3-in-1s like MMR and DtaP just because there are no alternatives?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>8. MoH should put in more effort to educate parents on how to build their children&#8217;s immunity, beyond just a balanced diet, sleep, exercise and personal hygiene. The officers responsible for infectious disease policy and control should read books like &#8220;Beyond Antibiotics&#8221; by Dr. Michael Schmidt and &#8220;Herbal Antibiotics&#8221; by Stephen Harrod Buhner and then teach the public how to prevent infectious diseases through all natural means possible and improve the chances of a speedy, uncomplicated recovery should their child succumb to the disease, by fortifying the immune system. This should apply to all the other diseases now covered by the Childhood Immunization Program &#8211; mumps, rubella, tetanus, polio, Hep B, etc.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>9. MoH should evaluate the use of natural medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases in light of the growing resistance of many types of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics and the threat of dengue fever, HFMD, chikungunya disease, H5N1 bird flu, H1N1 swine flu and SARS. It is an accepted medical fact that many antibiotics are fast becoming powerless against drug-resistant bacteria.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>10. MoH should rename the “National Childhood Immunization Program” as the “National Childhood Vaccination Program” because vaccination is not synonymous with immunization. People should not be complacently led to believe that they are immune from a disease just because they have been vaccinated against it. Vaccines are not 100% effective and do not confer lifelong immunity. For instance, a child can still be infected with invasive pneumococcal disease caused by other strains of bacteria not covered in the PCV-7.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Further to the above, I would like to request MoH to provide answers to the following questions:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>1. Why the oral polio vaccine is still being given when it has already been replaced in many countries by the injectable form which is safer. Oral polio vaccine was responsible for causing several cases of polio in the West.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>2. Are there still any routine childhood vaccines that contain thimerosal or ethylmercury as preservatives (these have been banned in many Western countries)?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>3. If all childhood vaccines are thimerosal- or ethylmercury-free now, when were they removed from childhood vaccines? MoH should provide a timetable showing the dates they were removed.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>4. In view of almost universal coverage for the BCG, Hep B, MMR and DtaP vaccines, why are there still significant numbers of cases of tuberculosis, measles, hepatitis B, mumps, rubella and pertussis in Singapore each year?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Finally I wish to personally testify that I have not consumed a single antibiotic, antiviral or medical drug (except for an antifungal medication once for a bad foot fungal infection) over the last eight years. I am confident that thousands of Singaporeans who know how to support their immune system naturally also share the same experience. I am pleased to enclose herewith several papers showing the power of natural medicines such as elderberry, zinc, vitamin C, oregano, cumin, sage and cinnamon against viral and bacterial pathogens for your review. There is evidence that such natural medicines are also effective against HFMD, dengue fever, chikungunya disease, chicken pox and rubella.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Best regards,</em></p>
<p>I await Dr. Hariharan&#8217;s reply.  It looks like parents may have to address their concerns to the Ministry of Education as well.</p>

			<div class="postBody"><p>By James Ong</p>
<p>The day following my second letter of appeal, Dr. Hariharan Subramony sent me a reply on behalf of the Minister for Health.  Reproduced below is the full content of the letter:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dear Mr Ong</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We refer to your email to Mr Khaw Boon Wan, Minister for Health, dated 19 Nov in which you raised various points on vaccine safety. We thank you for your feedback, and would like to provide the following information.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The National Childhood Immunisation Programme is a recommended schedule of vaccinations for infants and young children aimed at preventing dangerous diseases which may result in significant morbidity or mortality. These diseases include diptheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, tuberculosis and pneumococcal disease. The safety and efficacy of a vaccine is reviewed by MOH&#8217;s Expert Committee on Immunisation before a decision is made to include that vaccine in the NCIP.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With respect to this statement in your email : &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;.there has been no response from your Ministry regarding the concerns raised about the decision to make pneumococcal vaccination compulsory for all children under the age of five&#8221;,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>we would like to clarify that of the vaccinations included in the NCIP, only 2 (measles and diptheria) are compulsory. The remaining vaccinations, including pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), are recommended, but are not compulsory by law.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Possible side-effects after PCV vaccination include reactions at the injection site (eg pain, redness, swelling) and fever. These are generally self-limiting. So far, no serious reactions have been causally linked to this vaccine. In Holland, authorities have banned a batch of Prevnar following the deaths of 3 babies who received Prevnar. However, a definite link between the use of Prevnar and the deaths has not been established, and other batches of Prevnar continue to be used in Holland. In Singapore, adverse reactions to vaccines are monitored by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). If there is any evidence to suggest that a vaccine is unsafe, HSA and MOH will provide appropriate guidance.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Invasive pneumococcal disease is a serious disease. Between 2000 and 2008, there were a total of 157 deaths from invasive pneumococcal disease in Singapore, of whom 5 were under the age of 5 years. Neurologic sequelae may occur among those who survive. Vaccination against pneumococcal aims to minimise the mortality and morbidity associated with the disease. Nonetheless, no vaccine can be guaranteed to be 100% effective or to be totally free of side-effects. The decision whether or not to vaccinate a child with PCV should be made in consultation with a medical practitioner, and an understanding of the risks associated with the disease, and the potential risk of vaccine-related adverse reactions.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Regards</em></p>
<p>In Dr. Hariharan&#8217;s own words, no vaccine can be guaranteed to be 100% effective or to be totally free of side effects.  Parents beware!  What came as a real surprise to me and I am sure, to many parents as well, is that only two vaccines are compulsory by law &#8211; measles and diphtheria.  You will get fined if you do not vaccinate your child with these two vaccines.  The fine can be as high as $10,000 and could carry jail sentences as well.  The rest of the ten vaccines are only recommended.  I wonder how many parents are aware of this.  Isn&#8217;t it true that children are routinely vaccinated with all the prescribed vaccines according to schedule?  I doubt parents are ever told their rights and asked if they would like to postpone or refuse any vaccines for their children.  So I wrote another letter, this time addressed directly to Dr. Hariharan.  This will be in the next post.</p>

			<div class="postBody"><p>By James Ong</p>
<p>Here is the second letter that I sent to the Minister for Health, Mr. Khaw Boon Wan, after having waited for seven days without reply:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dear Minister Khaw,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am rather concerned that despite my email of November 12 (sent a week ago), there has been no response from your Ministry regarding the concerns raised about the decision to make pneumococcal vaccination compulsory for all children under the age of five. As the safety of innocent babies are at stake here, I would expect the Ministry to respond swiftly to these queries.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A recent special report by Generation Rescue (USA) revealed that countries that have fewer mandatory vaccines have much lower rates of autism. It is pertinent that Iceland and Sweden, which lead the world in under-five mortality rates, have far fewer mandatory vaccines than the USA, UK, Australia and New Zealand (countries cited by the Ministry as partial support for the decision to introduce compulsory pneumococcal vaccinations here). A copy of the report is enclosed.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Also enclosed is a document of the findings by the US House of Representatives Subcommittee hearings on vaccines and their risks. There is strong evidence that vaccines are responsible for epidemic levels of autism in the USA and other developed countries.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Autism now affects roughly 1 in 600 children in Singapore today. It is the leading cause of disability among children here. Has the MoH ever considered that vaccinations could have contributed to this problem and conduct a thorough investigation into the causes?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As all vaccinations carry risk of injury (despite what the MoH says), parents should be given all the facts – the scientific studies relied upon, the declaration of any potential conflicts of interest among the panel of experts, risk-benefit analyses done, etc. In the USA, investigations have revealed that the experts that sit on immunization committees do, on occasion, have links with manufacturers of vaccines or stand to gain financially if the vaccines were approved for mass use, which may have influenced their decisions.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Expert Committee presupposes that a vaccine such as Prevnar is the only weapon in preventing this disease. That is because they received their training only in conventional medicine. In truth, many knowledgeable parents know that if they breastfeed their babies for 6-12 months, feed their children with nutritious foods and fortify their diets with supplements (cod liver oil, multivitamins/minerals, probiotics, colostrum); do not send them to daycare centers at a young age, and exercise good hygiene and sanitation at home, their children are at a very low risk of contracting invasive pneumococcal infection. These parents should not be forced to vaccinate their children.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>All parents do have a constitutional right of life and personal liberty and religious freedom to choose what is best for their children. The right to make an informed choice/refusal is a universally-accepted medical ethic.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I do look forward to hearing from your Ministry soon regarding this matter.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Meanwhile, I urge that healthcare policy makers watch this video documentary, Vaccine Nation, that dispels the myth that vaccines are safe or is the answer for control of infectious diseases:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6531447125053615129&amp;ei=trAES5SNM5S8wgP82LmICg&amp;q=Vaccine+Nation#" target="_blank">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6531447125053615129&amp;ei=trAES5SNM5S8wgP82LmICg&amp;q=Vaccine+Nation#</a></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Another important video is “Vaccines: What the CDC Documents and Science Reveal” by Dr. Sherri J. Tenpenny. It is available from www.amazon.com.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Best regards,</em></p>
<p>You can get a copy of the Generation Rescue Special Report and Report of the US House of Representatives Subcommittee on Human Rights and Wellness Hearing (which lasted three years) by going to:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/documents/SPECIAL%20REPORT%20AUTISM%202.pdf">http://www.generationrescue.org/documents/SPECIAL%20REPORT%20AUTISM%202.pdf</a></p>

<p>You will learn about the dangers of mercury in vaccines; yet children were routinely injected with thimerosal-laden vaccines until 2002, when most of the children&#8217;s vaccines became mercury-free.  Most flu vaccines still contain thimerosal.</p>

			<div class="postBody"><p>By James Ong</p>
<p>In late October 2009, the Ministry of Health (MoH) announced that it had adopted the recommendation of the Expert Committee on Immunisation and included pneumococcal vaccination as the tenth vaccine in the National Childhood Immunisation Programme.  Parents can draw on their Medisave, Baby Bonus or Child Development Account to pay for the three shots of vaccines, which will cost them slightly over $500 in total.  As the announcement is silent on whether parents have the right to opt out of the vaccine, I was rather concerned that children are now to be given a total of 16 shots by the time they are two.  Vaccines have been implicated in the dramatic rise in autism and neurological and learning disorders seen in children around the world.  Further, vaccines have been known to cause severe adverse reactions, even death and permanent disability.  By the way, it should be borne in mind that the money in parents&#8217; Medisave, Baby Bonus and Child Development Accounts are their money.  So, it is as if the MoH wants you to vaccinate your children but you have to pay for them!  This is the same scenario with the Hepatits B vaccine, which costs roughly the same amount.  I did some investigations on the incidence and severity of invasive pneumococcal disease (PD) in Singapore and the risks versus benefits of the current PCV-7 vaccine (the number 7 indicates that is meant to deal with only 7 strains of bacteria that causes invasive PD), which carries the trade name Prevnar.  What I found shocked me and you will find out why by reading the letter below.</p>
<p>I therefore wrote an appeal letter to the Minster for Health, Mr. Khaw Boon Wan, asking him to make the vaccine entirely voluntary.  Reproduced below is the letter in its entirety:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dear Minister Khaw,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It is regrettable that the Ministry of Health has made pneumococcal vaccination compulsory for all children under the age of 5. This makes a total of 15 vaccine shots by the time a child is two.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Based on the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) own studies, the incidence of hospitalization for invasive pneumococcal infection is below 0.04 percent for children below five. For children aged 5-14, it is 0.0124 percent. Since 2000, there have been only seven deaths (less than one a year).</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The only large-scale clinical trial on the Prevnar pneumococcus vaccine, involving some 17,000 children, resulted in at least 12 deaths. Side effects included seizures, irritability, high fevers, vomiting, swelling and anaphylactic shock.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Since the vaccine’s introduction in the US, there have been more than 28,000 adverse events reported, more than 12,000 of which were serious, including 558 deaths, 555 life-threatening situations and 238 permanent disabilities (as of November 11, 2009). Evidently, the prevention is more deadly than the disease!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Recently, 3 babies died in Holland within two weeks of receiving the Prevnar vaccine, causing the Dutch health authorities to ban the particular batch of vaccines used.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Moreover, Prevnar covers only seven types of bacteria. With vaccination, more people are now affected by about 80 other types of bacteria that cause pneumonia. There will be greater problems ahead.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Vaccines are being made compulsory by heath authorities because antibiotics are no longer effective, as the overuse of antibiotics (in medicine and farming) has led to bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. Conventional medicine is fast running out of options, yet doctors and the MOH do not explore safer, natural alternatives: breastfeeding, good diet, exercise, sunshine, fresh air, sleep, hygiene and sanitation (in homes and childcare centers), dietary supplements, herbs and aromatic essential oils.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>According to the WHO and UNICEF, the best solution to infectious diseases is an adequate diet (for infants, that includes breastfeeding) with good sanitation and hygiene. In many third world countries, Vitamin A, zinc and iron supplements have achieved excellent results in combating infection.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I need to reiterate that all of the above assertions and statements are based on either reliable media reports or the scientific literature.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>We need greater transparency. How were the members of the Expert Committee on Immunization selected? Have they any financial ties (present or previous) to pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines, e.g. research grants, Board positions, etc? What are the studies they relied on? Have they considered why other industrialized countries have not made the vaccine compulsory? Will the ministry be setting up an independent agency to monitor adverse effects of the vaccine?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Children are gifts from the Divine, not the offspring of the State. Compulsory vaccinations deny parents their Divinely-given and fundamental human right to choose what is best for their children. This, I feel, is morally irresponsible, especially when the recommendations are based on shadowy science and the vaccine subjects their children to a measurable level of risk of serious injury or even death. The vaccine is freely available to the public and they can use their Baby Bonus or Medisave to pay for it. Why not just keep it that way?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Finally, I need to point out too that there is no universal consensus among scientists on the value of vaccinations in the prevention of infectious diseases. There is however overwhelming consensus that proper nutrition, clean drinking water, food safety, hygiene and sanitation have done more to prevent the spread of such diseases than vaccines. And for this, we have to thank our civil engineers, food safety and environmental health officers.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I therefore urge the Minister to call for a comprehensive review of the decision to make the pneumococcal vaccine compulsory.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Best regards,</em></p>
<p>I waited for a week and did not receive any reply from the Minister.  So I followed up with a second letter, as a chaser.  Please see the next post for the contents of the second letter.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>World leaders are realizing that medicines, money, research and legislation cannot by themselves win the battle against disease. As we face global plagues and deadly new diseases, can we find in the Bible a prescription for true health?</strong></p>
<p></strong><strong>The history of the human race is the story of an endless struggle against disease. We declare war on cancer and heart disease—yet they remain leading causes of death. Mammoth efforts were expended to eradicate malaria—a disease that helped topple the Roman Empire—yet it is returning with a vengeance. Citizens of the world are urged to fight against AIDS—yet this new disease is ravaging nations and destroying lives around the globe.  Billions of dollars are spent annually in the battle against disease, but the problems continue to grow. Is there something we have failed to see?</strong></p>
<p>     As a new millennium dawns, leaders in government and the medical community are beginning to realize that medicines, money, research and legislation alone cannot win the battle against disease. Winning the battle will require utilizing <em>every</em> tool available—and learning more effective ways to address problems. The situation we face on a global scale is serious. Old plagues once thought conquered are reemerging. Deadly new diseases are appearing. Health systems in many nations are deteriorating under the strain of burgeoning populations and limited financial resources. While the cry of &#8220;health for all&#8221; appears a noble and attainable goal, Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, director-general of the World Health Organization, acknowledges that &#8220;it remains elusive&#8221;—an <em>illusion</em> that keeps slipping over the horizon (<em>Foreign Policy, </em>Jan-Feb 2002, p. 25).<br />
     Perhaps it is time to ask: <em>Why</em> have we failed to win the battle against disease? Have <em>real</em> solutions been ignored? Can <em>religion</em> play a fundamental role in this crucial struggle? Did a loving and all-wise Creator reveal fundamental concepts that would <em>revolutionize</em> our approach to health? Does the Bible contain practical principles that could <em>effectively eliminate</em> the incredible burden of sickness that plagues the world?</p>
<p><strong>A Global Curse</strong></p>
<p>     In the early 1900s, infectious diseases were the leading causes of suffering and death in America and Europe. With improved sanitation and the introduction of antibiotics, these plagues were significantly reduced, but new killers have emerged. Today in America 725,000 people die annually from heart disease, and about 540,000 die from cancer. While these diseases kill <em>less than 1 percent</em> of the population, the suffering and pain inflicted is real—and the financial burden is huge. Americans spend more than $1 trillion a year <em>treating</em> disease! Yet to really grasp <em>the curse</em> of disease we need a global perspective.<br />
     Outside the developed world, we see a <em>sobering</em> picture, as infectious diseases ravage <em>incredible numbers</em> of people. In Africa, Central and South America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, preventable and curable diseases like diarrhea, respiratory disease, tuberculosis and malaria <em>kill</em> more than 13 million people a year—with children taking the hardest hit. However, the number of people who <em>live with</em> and <em>suffer from</em> these diseases is almost mind-boggling!<br />
     Between 300–500 million people contract malaria each year. Every day 3,000 children die of malaria—mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Tuberculosis (endemic in much of Africa and Southeast Asia) is spreading rapidly in Russia and Eastern Europe. In the next 20 years, tuberculosis will infect <em>one billion</em> new people and kill 35 million. AIDS is rapidly becoming the greatest threat to health, economic development and national stability in many African and Asian countries. More than 2.5 <em>billion</em> people are at risk from mosquito-borne Dengue fever in tropical and sub-tropical countries. There are 50 million cases and 25,000 Dengue-related fatalities each year. More than 60 million are exposed to sleeping sickness and about 500,000 contract the disease each year. Five hundred million are at risk for schistosomiasis (bilharzia, snail fever) and 200 million are afflicted. Intestinal worm infections plague <em>one half of the human race—three billion people.</em> More than 146 million suffer from bacteria-transmitted trachoma that has left six million blind. More than 120 million people are at risk for onchocerciasis (river blindness) and 18 million are infected annually. Measles infects 30 million and kills nearly a million each year. Leprosy still disables between one and two million people (<em>WHO Fact Sheets</em> at <em>www.who.int)</em>.<br />
     Tragically, the heaviest burden of infectious disease falls on the poorest, least-developed countries of the world. Many of these countries are also burdened with crushing debt, crumbling infrastructures, and rampant corruption (see <em>World Press Review,</em> October 2001, pp. 3–15), and are simply unable to deal with such horrendous problems—so people continue to suffer under the <em>global curse</em> of disease. A British colonial physician once wrote that &#8220;the great mass of Africa… has carried a more grievous burden of disease than any other region of the world… the present inhabitants of tropical Africa host a wider variety of human parasites than any other people&#8221; (<em>Bid the Sickness Cease</em>, Ransford, 1983, pp. 7, 13). In some regions of tropical Africa, 60–90 percent of the population carries parasites. To eliminate this agonizing burden of disease, we must understand and address the <em>true causes</em> of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Causative Factors</strong></p>
<p>     For many, the solution to the problem of infectious disease is finding more money to buy medications and establish clinics to deliver treatments. This alleviates suffering by treating the symptoms—but <em>does not</em> <em>address</em> the underlying causes of the problem. That is why the World Health Organization and the United Nations have focused on breaking the &#8220;<em>vicious cycle</em> of poverty, ignorance and disease.&#8221; Most infectious diseases that plague developing countries are associated with <em>poverty</em>—crowded, unsanitary living conditions, lack of clean water, failure to properly dispose of human waste and garbage, lack of protection against disease-bearing insects (window screens, mosquito nets, repellants and insecticides). People living in poverty and governments strapped for cash simply do not have access to, or cannot provide, these health-promoting means (see <em>World Press Review,</em> June 2001, pp. 3–15).<br />
     <em>Ignorance</em> also plays a critical role. People living in poor rural areas often do not know that mosquito bites and tsetse flies transmit disease. Countless millions do not realize that sexual activity and injecting street drugs can transmit AIDS. Many who do not understand disease transmission use water from streams, lakes and waterholes contaminated by human and animal wastes—because it is the only water available. Unknowing consumption of animals and other organisms that transmit diseases is also a factor in contracting serious illnesses. Close contact with sick people and their personal items and traveling to and from disease-ridden areas aids the spread of disease.<br />
     <em>Motivation</em> is a critical factor in promoting health and preventing disease. Many know what to do to avoid becoming sick, yet do not act accordingly. People smoke in spite of warnings that smoking causes cancer. Many eat diets rich in fat and calories in spite of warnings that such diets lead to heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Many know that hands should be washed carefully after urinating or defecating and before preparing or eating food, but simply do not do it. Changing individual behavior is a major challenge in the battle against disease. <em>These fundamental issues must be addressed</em> before the burden of sickness will be lifted and the battle against disease will be won.</p>
<p><strong>A New Perspective</strong></p>
<p>     But how do you banish ignorance? How do you change human behavior? How do you motivate people to think and act differently? How can you eliminate disease and consequences of poverty without money? These are generally not areas of expertise for medical doctors, health planners, government ministers and economists—yet finding answers in these areas is <em>critical</em> to lifting the burden of disease. Education obviously must play a major role in banishing ignorance. What a person <em>believes</em> is a major factor in motivating behavior change. Addressing the consequences of poverty and eliminating disease without money will require <em>rethinking</em> how we tackle the problem. We must find ways to impact large numbers of people without building more schools, hiring more teachers or putting more people on government payrolls. We need to ask—is there anyone <em>already positioned </em>who is capable of doing the job?<br />
     Believe it or not, <em>religious leaders</em> occupy an ideal position for eliminating ignorance and promoting behaviors that can defeat disease. Religious leaders have regular weekly contact with large numbers of people—usually all age groups. They promote values that influence personal behavior. Many are already paid by a private organization. The major problem is that religious leaders have <em>not been prepared</em> to function in this vital role of preventing disease and promoting health. In fact, many religious leaders are simply <em>unaware</em> of the <em>powerful potential</em> of their position. Most government, clergy and medical personnel assume the primary role of religion is to comfort the sick and console the bereaved. While this is helpful, it overlooks a <strong>God</strong>-<strong>intended role</strong> for religious leaders that is clearly outlined in the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>Biblical Principles</strong></p>
<p>     The Bible states that &#8220;the fear of the Lord is the <em>beginning</em> [starting point] of knowledge&#8221; (Proverbs 1:7). When we look to Scripture for instructions about health, it is remarkable what our Creator has revealed. God told the ancient nation of Israel that it could <em>avoid</em> the curse of disease if it <em>obeyed</em> His commandments and statutes (Exodus 15:26). The commandments of God recorded in the Bible contain powerful tools designed to prevent disease and promote health. Sadly, many theologians assume these instructions no longer apply today—and <em>ignore </em>them. Because of this mistaken belief, most people—the medical community included—are <em>unaware</em> of the potential contribution biblical religion could make in the field of public health.<br />
     The Bible reference to clean and unclean animals is no secret. Yet many assume these ancient dietary regulations are no longer relevant and that Christians have been liberated from &#8220;outdated&#8221; restrictions. Such assumptions thrive because theologians do not understand the reasons for, or the benefits of, these instructions. Commentaries often spiritualize away these important laws. However, in its comments on Leviticus 14:1, the <em>Expositor’s Bible Commentary</em> states: &#8220;Priests were public health officers in addition to their religious role.&#8221; Religious leaders in ancient Israel taught people <em>not to eat</em> unclean animals (Leviticus 11; Deuteronomy 14). Many of these animals carry disease-causing organisms. Eating undercooked flesh of pigs, bears, rabbits, dogs and horses can transmit tularemia and trichinosis to humans (see <em>Control of Communicable Diseases Manual,</em> Benenson, 1995). All shellfish are considered unclean. Crayfish and lobsters are scavengers that feed on dead organisms that can transmit disease. Filter-feeding clams and oysters concentrate viruses that cause hepatitis and paralytic or neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (<em>ibid</em>.). Liver fluke infections are common where raw fish and crayfish are widely consumed. These diseases can be <em>prevented</em> by not eating foods the Bible calls &#8220;unclean&#8221;—which is cheaper and more effective than <em>treating</em> disease.<br />
     Biblical admonitions also include <em>avoiding contact</em> with animals that have died or with whatever has touched them (see Leviticus 11:32–40). Porous earthen vessels, potentially contaminated, were to be destroyed to avoid spreading disease. These biblical regulations are consistent with sound microbiological techniques, and are fundamentally important in fighting infectious disease. It was the priests’ job to teach and explain these laws. Priests were to designate as unclean those who had contagious diseases <em>characterized by skin rashes</em>, such as leprosy, measles, smallpox and scarlet fever. Such individuals were to be isolated from others to prevent the spread of disease (see Leviticus 13). These biblical guidelines are the basis of medically sound <em>quarantine procedures</em> that have been used for centuries. Bible guidelines include avoiding contact with personal items of sick people that could transmit germs (Leviticus 13:47–59). Contaminated items were to be washed or burned (which destroys microorganisms). Biblical health instructions even applied to dwellings—mold or fungal growth had to be scraped off, or a house would be quarantined or demolished. Cracks, which harbor ticks and other disease-bearing bugs, were to be plastered (Leviticus 14:33–48). The priest functioned as both a <em>public health educator</em> and a building inspector, to promote health and prevent disease.<br />
     The Bible acknowledges that body fluids can be a vehicle for transmitting disease (Leviticus 15). Contact with human waste materials, nasal discharges, tears, saliva and other fluids, or contact with soiled towels or linen, can spread infectious disease. Trachoma—a leading cause of blindness—is spread by contact with soiled hand towels and eye-seeking flies. Those coming into contact with fluids from a sick person had to wash their hands and clothes in water, bathe, and remain isolated from other people until evening as a precaution against spreading disease (Leviticus 15:11). Men and women were to bathe after having sexual relations (Leviticus 15:18). The purpose of these sanitary laws was to promote health and prevent disease (Leviticus 15:31). <em>They were not just ceremonial rituals</em>.<br />
     One of the most practical and powerful biblical admonitions states that when people dwell together, human wastes are to be <em>deposited outside</em> the living area and <em>buried</em> (Deuteronomy 23:12–14). This prevents waste materials from coming in contact with people, flies and other organisms that transmit disease. It also prevents the contamination of water supplies. Many diseases, such as diarrhea, dysentery, hookworm, roundworms, cholera and typhoid, result from contact with human waste. Wearing shoes and not using human waste as fertilizer are also important preventive measures. The sanitary disposal of human waste, and access to clean water, are two of the most important ways of preventing disease (see <em>Water and Dirt—matters of life and death, </em>World Health Forum, 1997, Vol. 18, pp. 266–268). One physician stated that if these two goals could be achieved, nearly 75 percent of Africa’s diseases would disappear! God instructed Israel’s religious leaders to promote these goals—to protect health and to <em>provide an example</em> for other peoples (Deuteronomy 4:1–8). Sadly, modern religious leaders have failed to grasp the importance of their <strong>God-given role</strong> in promoting behaviors that defeat disease.<br />
     The Bible also takes a strong stand against adultery, fornication, homosexuality and other unhealthy sexual activities (Leviticus 18). Sex outside marriage is labeled a sin, and in many cases was punishable by death in Old Testament times (see Leviticus 20:10–13). In sharp contrast to the modern notion that unrestricted sexual activity is liberating, the Bible pointedly states that &#8220;whoever commits adultery… <em>lacks understanding</em>&#8221; (Proverbs 6:32), and that sexually promiscuous people <em>sin against their own bodies</em> (1 Corinthians 6:16–18). Public policies like this—promoted by religious leaders and backed by civil authority—were designed to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases—including AIDS. Those who downplay this effective approach are helping to foster epidemic diseases. An &#8220;ounce of prevention is [<em>still</em>] worth a pound of cure&#8221;—and is much less expensive in dollars and lives! This was the biblical message religious leaders were to convey—but it is a message often ignored today!<br />
     The clear thrust of many biblical principles is to <em>prevent</em> problems before they arise. Proverbs 22:3 states that &#8220;a prudent man foresees evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are punished.&#8221; From a public health perspective many diseases can be prevented—saving money and lives—by taking wise precautions ahead of time. Malaria can be prevented by installing screens on doors and windows, using mosquito nets, insect repellants, wearing protective clothing and eliminating breeding sites for mosquitoes—in standing water, old tires and garbage dumps. The sanitary disposal of human and animal waste prevents contact with people, flies and other organisms that can spread disease. Sexually transmitted diseases—including AIDS—can be prevented by obeying biblical instructions. That is why God instructed religious leaders to promote these behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>The Coming Restitution</strong></p>
<p>     One of the tragic consequences of the modern separation of church and state has been the loss of an important alliance between civil and religious leaders in the struggle to defeat disease and promote health. Doctors and theologians often become antagonists working within the confines of their separate disciplines. As a result of this split, religious leaders have <em>failed to perceive or perform</em> an important role. Dr. Richard Muga, Director of Medical Services in Kenya, commented in an interview that religious leaders can do much to lift the burden of disease. He made the remarkable observation that &#8220;perhaps churches <em>do not know</em> what they should be doing&#8221; and that &#8220;<em>someone needs to remove the blindness.&#8221;</em><br />
     The facts of history and Bible prophecy attest to the accuracy of Dr. Muga’s astute assessment. Scripture indicates that Satan has <em>deceived</em> the whole world (Revelation 12:9), and that leaders are often <em>blind</em> to obvious solutions (Isaiah 56:9–10; Matthew 15:14). Blindness can result from mistaken assumptions. Modern theologians do not understand their God-given role in preventing disease and promoting health, because of events that occurred early in Church history. As the number of Gentile Christians increased, pressures mounted to make a clear distinction between Christianity and Judaism. Arguments were devised discouraging observance of the Sabbath, Holy Days and biblical health laws (see <em>From Sabbath to Sunday, </em>Bacchiocchi, 1995, chapter 2). Scholars called these practices <em>burdens,</em> intended only for Jews, and claimed that Jesus &#8220;nailed these regulations to the cross&#8221; as no longer relevant. Yet in fact, Jesus instructed His disciples to keep even the least of God’s commandments (Matthew 5:17–19; John 14:15), and taught that <em>our sins</em>—not God’s laws—were nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:13–14), when Jesus was made &#8220;to be sin for us&#8221; (2 Corinthians 5:21). Scripture further teaches that Paul’s writings would be twisted out of context (2 Peter 3:16), and that a time is coming when the whole world will learn to live by the laws of God (see Jeremiah 31:31–33; Ezekiel 11:14–20; 36:24–27; Zechariah 14).<br />
     The Bible reveals that while the &#8220;whole creation groans&#8221; (Romans 8:18–23), a &#8220;restitution of all things&#8221; lies just ahead (Acts 3:19–21). Jesus Christ will return to Earth to establish the kingdom of God, and God’s law will be proclaimed to the whole world from Jerusalem (Isaiah 2:2–4; 9:6–7). In this coming world-ruling government, Church and state will be reunited (Revelation 5:10). During this millennial period, Jesus Christ and the saints will teach people to <em>obey</em> the laws and statutes of God (Isaiah 30:20–21). The burden of suffering will be lifted. The battle against sickness will be won, and disease will begin to disappear (Isaiah 35:5–6; Jeremiah 30:17). While this sounds incredible today, <em>it is part of the gospel—the good news</em> of what the future holds!<br />
     In tomorrow’s world, the blindness that has obscured the true role of biblical religion will be removed (Isaiah 42:7). Religious leaders, in partnership with health professionals, will defeat disease and promote health—<em>using biblical educational principles</em>—backed by God’s supernatural power<em> </em>(Revelation 11:15–18). Leaders today who have the vision and courage to structure health policies around a sound biblical model will ride the crest of a wave that is destined to sweep over the earth in the years just ahead. Anyone brave enough to examine the Bible will find that it challenges assumptions that have blinded generations, and can play a vital role in defeating disease!</td>

			<div class="postBody"><p>Posted by James Ong</p>
<p><a href="http://balmofgilead.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/j0422274.jpg" rel="lightbox[194]"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-195" title="42-15614989" src="http://balmofgilead.info/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/j0422274-300x300.jpg" alt="42-15614989" width="300" height="300" /></a>Our local health authorities and the PUB have been assuring us, over the years, that fluoridated water (i.e. water coming out of our taps) is safe to drink.  It helps prevent tooth decay, they say.  It may shock or surprise you that there is now a huge number of scientists, more than 2,000  (comprising medical doctors, dentists, environmental scientists, lawyers, naturopathic doctors, nurses, etc.) calling for a worldwide ban on the fluoridation of drinking water.</p>
<p>What we need to know is that only about 60 countries worldwide, comprising a population of only about 330 million, fluoridate their drinking water.  Many of the advanced European nations do not fluoridate their water.  The vast majority of the world&#8217;s population (6 billion less 330 million) do not drink fluoridated water.  Studies show that those countries which do not fluoridate their drinking  water do not suffer from higher rates of tooth decay at all.  The answer to tooth decay is simple &#8211; avoiding sugary, refined and processed foods, eating nutritious foods that are high in calcium and other minerals and brushing teeth regularly.  Use of topical fluoride toothpaste may be of some benefit but not absolutely necessary so long as the other dietary and lifestyle habits are in place.  You see, fluoride works best topically, not when ingested.</p>
<p>In Singapore, drinking water is fluoridated at 0.7 parts per million.  That means that for every liter of water you drink, you are getting 0.7 milligram of fluoride.  Assuming an average person drinks 2 liters of water a day, over a lifespan of 80 years, he or she will be ingesting 40 kilograms of fluoride.  Many people drink more than 2 liters a day.  Fluoride is a known neurotoxin and carcinogen.  In fact, it is one of the most harmful substances known to man, almost on par with mercury.  Fluoride has been implicated in osteoporosis, arthrities, endocrine disorders, infertility, certain cancers, dementia, ADHD and autism.  All these diseases have been on the rise since fluoridation began in 1956.</p>
<p>I strongly encourage you to watch the following two videos which highlight the dangers of fluoridating drinking water:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fluoridealert.org/">http://www.fluoridealert.org/</a> You will see a video screen entitled, &#8220;Professional Perspectives on Water Fluoridation&#8221;.  Click on the &#8220;Play&#8221; button to watch the video.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3y8uwtxrHo"></a><a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=Fluoride+Deception&amp;emb=0&amp;aq=f#">The Fluoride Deception Video</a></p>
<p>You will learn there there is no solid science behind the purported benefits of fluoridation.  You will learn that fluorides are toxic, chemical waste products of American industry.  These industries found a clever way of cheaply disposing of them without further treatment to make them non-toxic:  by convincing the water authorities that adding fluoride to drinking water will prevent tooth decay.  Once again, we find our local health authorities merely &#8220;parroting&#8221; the official statements of organizations like the FDA, AMA, ADA, WHO, etc., without doing any independent research or literature review of their own.  These are the same organizations that used to say that smoking is safe; encouraged women to smoke, and that lead in petrol is safe.  We now know these to be untrue.</p>
<p>Even the American Dental Association (ADA) has issued an official statement warning that infants should not be fed formula milk made up from fluoridated water because the levels of fluoride in that water may be harmful to the infants.  Yet, our local health authorities have not looked into this issue at all and mothers in Singapore still prepare infant formula with regular, fluoridated water.</p>
<p>Richer households can simply circumvent this problem by installing expensive water filters to remove the fluoride.  Poorer households cannot afford to do so.  They are thus most vulnerable to the cumulative toxic effects of fluoride.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Executive Summary of Beating Cancer With Nutrition</span></p>
<p>IF YOU ARE TOO SICK TO READ MUCH,THEN READ THIS SECTION</p>
<p><strong>21 days to a healthier cancer patient</strong></p>
<p>“Dance as if no one is watching. Work as if you don’t need the money.” Anonymous</p>
<p>BEATING CANCER THROUGH:</p>
<p>DAY 1: HOPE, OPTIMISM, AND A FIGHTING SPIRIT</p>
<p>Focus on the parts of your body that are working properly, not on the cancer. Since you are alive enough to read this book, then something and perhaps quite a bit are working in your body. Give thanks for everything that you can think of. Thanksgiving is a healing balm on the body and soul.</p>
<p>What are your priorities in life? Have they changed since finding out about your cancer diagnosis? Have they changed for the better? Is it possible that cancer has become a life-threatening, yet valuable wakeup call for you?</p>
<p>We are all going to die. The question is not &#8220;if&#8221;, but rather &#8220;when&#8221;. For cancer patients, sometimes this &#8220;when&#8221; becomes a more immediate issue. But our finite lives should be an issue for all of us, all of the time. Life is precious. Not to be wasted. Many of us cram our days with minutia, trivial details. We spend too much time worrying about insignificant events and lose sight of the real issues in life:</p>
<ul>
<li>be here now</li>
<li>value your mission</li>
<li>cherish your friends and family</li>
<li>savor sunsets and sunrises</li>
<li>soak up the beauty and music and laughter and play that is all around you, but drowned out by the cacophony of crass commercialism</li>
<li>be at peace with your Creator, however you conceive that Higher Power</li>
</ul>
<p>People beat cancer all the time. But fear of death is not a reason to live. What do you want them to say at your funeral? &#8220;Look, I think she&#8217;s moving!!&#8221; Not going to happen. Begin today with a renewed sense of purpose and proper perspective for the truly memorable things in life. Build a fighting &#8220;can-do&#8221; spirit that will serve you well for the coming journey of treating your cancer. Find a &#8220;co-patient&#8221;, a loved one, or family member who is so supportive that they will keep you motivated when you have run out of steam.</p>
<p>Be enthusiastic. The word &#8220;enthusiasm&#8221; comes from the Greek words meaning &#8220;God within&#8221;. With joy, enthusiasm, appreciation, and altruism, we literally become a conduit for God&#8217;s life itself.</p>
<p>DAY 2: KNOWLEDGE, OPTIONS, DATA GATHERING</p>
<p>While your doctor who made the cancer diagnosis may have a plan for you, it is probably not the only therapy that is appropriate for your cancer and may not even be the best therapy. You need to explore your options. In today&#8217;s society, getting information is easier than ever before. Get on the Internet and spend a few hours gathering data and phone numbers on who can help you with your particular cancer. The more knowledge that you have on the treatment and curing of your cancer, the more likely you are to make the right decision on which &#8220;wagon master&#8221; to choose for your vital treatment ahead.</p>
<p>Consider hyperthermia as primary or adjunctive therapy for your cancer. The following can provide a detailed report on doctors around the world who have a successful track record in treating your cancer:</p>

<li>Greg Anderson, CancerRecovery.org, ph.800-238-6479</li>

<li>Susan Silberstein, PhD, Cancer Education, ph.610-642-4810</li>
<li>Steven Ross, PhD, World Research Foundation ph.520-284-3300</li>
</ul>
<p>DAY 3: THE POWER OF NUTRITIONAL SYNERGISM</p>
<p>Synergism means that 1 + 1 = 3 or 500, but a whole lot more than 2. Synergism tells us that the combined efforts of certain factors yield more than what would have been expected. Do not rely on any &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; nutrient to beat your cancer. There are no such things. Your body needs the 50 recognized essential nutrients plus a couple of hundred other valuable nutrients that can only be found in a wholesome diet that is supplemented with the right nutrients.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the most important part of a car?&#8221; Some people answer: &#8220;The engine.&#8221; Fine. Then I will give you an engine and let&#8217;s see you drive it home. A car, like a healthy human body, is composed of many essential parts. The most important part of the car is the one that is not working. In building a house, all of the raw materials must arrive in the proper ratio at the proper time, otherwise you cannot build a sturdy home. Same thing with the human body. Nutritional synergism says that when you gather the right nutrients together at the right time in the right ratio, the body becomes a lean, mean, disease-fighting machine. Nothing less will do in your quest to beat cancer.</p>
<p>DAY 4: STARVE THE CANCER</p>
<p>Cancer is a sugar-feeder. The scientists call it an &#8220;obligate glucose metabolizer&#8221;. You can slow cancer growth by lowering the amount of fuel available to the tumor cells. Americans have become humming birds in our constant consumption of sweet fluids and foods. The resulting constant high blood glucose levels yield many diseases, including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and yeast infections. Trying to beat cancer while eating a diet that constantly raises blood glucose is like trying to put out a forest fire while someone nearby is throwing gasoline on the trees.</p>
<p>Stop eating sugar. Eat very few sweet foods, including high glycemic fruits. Begin an exercise program to burn blood glucose down to a manageable level. Your cancer is not going to be happy as you begin to starve it. You will develop sugar cravings worse than you currently have. Ignore them and push through the discomfort.</p>
<p>Make fish and colorful vegetables the staples in your diet. Eat small amounts of fresh fruits at a mixed meal, which will blunt the rises in blood glucose. Use cinnamon liberally, since it helps to stabilize blood glucose. Take supplements of chromium and magnesium. I have yet to see a cancer patient beat the disease who continued to load up on the average amounts of sugar in our diet, which is 140 pounds per year per person.</p>
<p>DAY 5: AVOID MALNUTRITION</p>
<p>Cancer is a wasting disease. Over 40% of cancer patients actually die from malnutrition, not from the cancer. Cancer generates chemicals that lower appetite while increasing calorie needs. The net effect is that many cancer patients begin to lose weight. You cannot fight a life-threatening disease while malnourished. You need all the proper nutrition you can get to feed your immune system, which is your army assigned to killing the cancer cells. The backbone of the immune system is protein. If you cannot eat solid foods, then try the Dragon-slayer shake mentioned later in this book.</p>
<p>DAY 6: NUTRITION + MEDICINE= IMPROVED RESULTS</p>
<p>While chemotherapy and radiation can kill cancer cells, these therapies are general toxins against your body cells also. A well-nourished cancer patient can protect healthy cells against the toxic effects of chemo and radiation, thus making the cancer cells more vulnerable to the medicine. Proper nutrition can make chemo and radiation more of a selective toxin against the cancer and less damaging to the patient.</p>
<p>DAY 7: TURBOCHARGE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM</p>
<p>Your immune system consists of 20 trillion cells that compose your police force and garbage collectors. The immune system is responsible for killing the bad guys, any cells that are not participating in the processes of your body, including cancer, yeast, bacteria, virus, and dead cells. &#8220;Kill the bad guys and take out the trash.&#8221; That is what your immune system is supposed to do. But since you have cancer, something is wrong with your immune system: usually either stress, toxic burden, or malnutrition.</p>
<p>Eat well and take professionally designed nutrition supplements. Lower your stress levels. Use guided imagery to imagine your immune cells like sharks gobbling up the cancer cells. This technique really works!! Detoxify your body. The average American body has 1,000 times more heavy toxic metals than our primitive ancestors before the dawning of the industrial age. Toxins shut down the ability of the immune system to mount a good battle against the cancer cells.</p>
<p>As your cells divide billions of times daily, mistake cells are the inevitable consequence. These mistake cells sometimes grow into cancer cells, which your immune system recognizes as being defective and then gobbles them up like Pac Man. The average adult gets 6 bouts of cancer in a lifetime, yet only 42% of Americans will end up in a cancer hospital. The other 58% had a respectable immune system, which protected the person against defective cells rising up to become palpable life-threatening cancer. Get your immune system working and the end of your cancer is in sight. Nutrition products that have demonstrated an ability to bolster immune functions include: colostrum extracts (lactoferrin, transfer factor), whey extracts, aloe extracts, mushroom extracts (Maitake, AHCC), yeast cell wall extracts (1,3 beta glucan), IP-6 (phytic acid), ImmKine (Aidan 480-446-8181), and Essiac tea.</p>
<p>DAY 8: THE HEALING POWER OF WHOLE FOODS</p>
<p>It is amazing how simple the answer to cancer can be. Our brilliant researchers have spent 33 years and $50 billion of your tax dollars wrestling with the complex issue of curing cancer. Yet Nature has been solving the dilemma for thousands of years. All of us get cancer all of the time, yet magical ingredients in a whole food diet are there to help the body beat cancer. Ellagic acid from berries induces &#8220;suicide&#8221; in the cancer cells. Lycopenes from tomatoes help to suppress cancer growth. Genistein in soy, glutathione in green leafy vegetables, and S-allyl cysteine in garlic are examples of the new scientifically-validated cancer fighters of the 21st century.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to wait for 7 years while some drug company goes through the $800 million drug approval process, nor for FDA approval, nor for a doctor&#8217;s prescription for some drug that has many toxic side effects and costs thousands of dollars each month. These miracle anti-cancer agents are waiting patiently at your nearby grocery store and health food store.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat foods in as close to their natural state as is possible.</li>
<li>Eat as much colorful vegetables as your colon can tolerate.</li>
<li>If a food will not rot or sprout, then throw it out.</li>
<li>Shop the perimeter (outside aisles) of the grocery store.</li>
</ul>
<p>DAY 9: NUTRITIOUS AND DELICIOUS RECIPES</p>
<p>Now that you understand the importance of eating wholesome foods to beat your cancer, you will need some tips on making this food palatable. See Noreen&#8217;s chapter on &#8220;Nutritious &amp; Delicious&#8221; for many great tasting recipes. I have hosted many a class with hundreds of cancer patients where we would tell them what foods might help them to beat their cancer. Women, in general, seem more receptive to these new cooking ideas. Men, in general, seem less interested in changing 50 years of eating habits. Gravy is not a beverage, contrary to popular belief in America. Those same men who turned their nose up at our recipe suggestions are now dead.</p>
<p>You are trying to take simple food straight from Nature and use healthy seasonings to make a quick and tasty meal. Crock pot, pressure cooker, steaming, and grilling are all wonderful means of cooking nourishing foods. Some produce is most nutritious when eaten raw, such as many vegetables and all fruit. A high speed blender can take any leftovers or foods that are not appealing and blend them in to a smoothie drink or a nice soup.</p>
<p>Try a couple of boiled eggs with a bowl of oatmeal and a half cup of cantaloupe for breakfast. Move on to a lunch with grilled chicken breast sandwich with spinach and onions, wild rice, a bowl of deep-colored fresh vegetables with homemade Italian dressing, and a half cup of raspberries for dessert. A sample dinner might be grilled halibut with lemon, baked sweet potatoes, fresh tomato slices with onions and homemade Italian dressing, and a dessert of a half cup of fresh papaya.</p>
<p>This is all nourishing food that you can learn to savor, easy to prepare, and easy to find at your local grocery store. And it will help you to beat your cancer.</p>
<p>DAY 10: HERBAL MEDICINE</p>
<p>There are thousands of herbs that have been used for thousands of years to treat cancer. None are guaranteed cures for all cancers, but many are non-toxic boosters of immune function and detoxification pathways. If you want just the basic herb that all cancer patients should be using daily, then start with garlic&#8211;as a food, seasoning, and/or pill supplement.</p>
<p>Many other herbs merit attention, as you will see in the chapter on herbs. Astragalus, echinacea, goldenseal, licorice, ginseng, ginkgo, ginger, Rhodiola rosea, and cat’s claw are on the golden hit parade of herbs to help you toward recovery from cancer. Work with a professional who can help guide you toward which herb is best for your disease, your therapy, your wallet, and your stomach tolerances.</p>
<p>DAY 11: HEALTHY FATS</p>
<p>While too much fat and the wrong kind of fat have been killing millions of Americans for the past 50 years, we are now finding a new form of fat malnutrition: deficiencies of the essential fats. Fish oil, borage or primrose oil, flax oil, conjugated linoleic acid (from the meat and milk of ruminants like cows and sheep), and shark liver oil are all fats that can help you to beat your cancer. For a simple starter, begin taking a few capsules of fish oil daily, preferably basic cod liver oil with all the good vitamin A and D still intact. You can also make a delicious, healthy Italian salad dressing by using flax oil, olive oil, water, vinegar, and some seasonings.</p>
<p>The right fats in your diet will feed the precious pathways for beneficial prostaglandins, which are crucial to beating cancer. Healthy fats line the cell membranes and help to lower blood glucose by making insulin more effective. Healthy fats make the immune cells more likely to recognize and destroy cancer cells.</p>
<p>DAY 12: MINERALS</p>
<p>Before modern agriculture, farmers would use manure and compost to nourish the soil before planting the crops. Today, we use only nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (N:P:K) as the basic fertilizer. With each passing harvest, the American soils and our bodies become more deficient in essential minerals for health. For instance, scientists have found that a dust speck of selenium (200 micrograms daily) can lower cancer incidence by 60% and raise immune functions dramatically. Deprive animals of magnesium and they spontaneously develop lymphoma. Some of our cancer epidemic in America is due to our serious and widespread deficiency in essential minerals.</p>
<p>Buy a basic mineral supplement, containing decent amounts of calcium, magnesium, chromium, and selenium. Add some kelp, which is rich in the trace minerals that are found both in the ocean and supposed to be found in your body fluid.</p>
<p>DAY 13: VITAMINS</p>
<p>Vitamins are the factory workers that get things done. Calories are the fuel for energy, and minerals are part of the structure or help vitamins to get things done. Most Americans are deficient in vitamins, even on the basic survival Recommended Dietary Allowance level. For a starter package, buy a quality broad spectrum vitamin supplement; then add extra vitamin C (1-4 grams per day), E (200-800 mg/d), green tea capsules, curcumin, and fish oil. If your stomach and wallet can tolerate it, take ImmunoPower (ImmunoPower.com or 800-247-6553), a convenient and cost-effective mixture of 87 nutrition ingredients or ImmunoPower EZ with 44 ingredients (GettingHealthier.com).</p>
<p>DAY 14: PROBIOTICS&#8211;FRIENDLY BACTERIA</p>
<p>Professor Elie Metchnikoff won a Nobel prize in 1908 for his work on the immune system. He later discovered the bacteria that makes yogurt (lactobacillus) and declared &#8220;Death begins in the colon.&#8221; Indeed, it may. And the colon and gut of most Americans are under siege by unfriendly organisms and free radicals.</p>
<p>When we eat nourishing food, our well-established colony of friendly bacteria in the colon eats yeast like a bird munches on insects. Many Americans eat too much fat, too much sugar, not enough fiber, and very little probiotic food (like yogurt and tempeh); take antibiotics (which wipe out all bacteria in the body, including the friendly bacteria); and subject ourselves to stress&#8211; all of which affects the balance of power between good and bad microorganisms in the gut. The net effect is an overgrowth of yeast, along with a deficiency of friendly bacteria that feed the immune system via the lining of the intestines. The yeast, which are there to degrade feces upon elimination, become hateful dictators in the gut. Many health problems result from what is called &#8220;dysbiosis&#8221; of the gut, or not having the right kind of microorganisms in charge.</p>
<p>Eat more fiber and no white sugar. Drink plenty of clean water. Eat yogurt daily or take a probiotic supplement. Make sure that you have a daily bowel movement. Use gentle herbal laxatives, like senna, if necessary. After 40 years of poor diet and chronic constipation, some people need colon flushing. Find a qualified expert to help on this issue.</p>
<p>At least 40% of our immune system surrounds the gastro-intestinal tract. For better or for worse, the status of our gut will begin the healing or the deterioration of a cancer patient.</p>
<p>DAY 15: WATER</p>
<p>Only one substance is found in all forms of life: water. Our bodies and the earth&#8217;s surface are composed of 2/3 water. Water is the most amazing substance on earth, providing the fluid of life in your body and the bathing solution for all cells in your body. Yet, most Americans do not get enough water and are drinking contaminated water.</p>
<p>Our water pollution situation in this country has been called &#8220;a ticking time bomb.&#8221; by the Environmental Protection Agency. We have used our rivers, lakes, and oceans as if they were sewers to dump unconscionable amounts of toxins. And we end up drinking that stuff. Pollution in our water supply is part of the reason for our growing cancer epidemic in this country.</p>
<p>Buy yourself a good water filter system and install it on your kitchen tap. Dual stage carbon filtration may cost $100-$200, with reverse osmosis costing two or three times that much. If need be, buy bottled water from a respectable vendor. Some bottled water is merely bottled city tap water with sugar added to make it taste better. Drink enough water to dilute your urine so that it is nearly clear in color and inoffensive in odor. Chronic dehydration first shows up in wrinkled skin, poor concentration, constipation, frequent infections, and eventually may appear as cancer. Water is your friend. Drink lots of clean water.</p>
<p>DAY 16: BREATHING</p>
<p>Cancer is an anaerobic growth. Healthy cells in your body are aerobic, meaning that they need oxygen. Cancer hates well-oxygenated tissues of the body. Lung tissue, which is well oxygenated, develops cancer as the result of smoking carcinogens and excessive &#8220;rusting&#8221; of tissue in the absence of antioxidants to protect the lung tissue. I have found lung cancer in non-smokers to be quite reversible if the person is willing to follow the guidelines in this book.</p>
<p>Of all nutrients required by the human body, oxygen is the most essential. We can go weeks and even months without food, days without water, but only a few minutes without oxygen. We are aerobic creatures by design. Cancer is the opposite. Unfortunately, many Americans breathe shallowly, thinking that sucking in our stomach is more important than diaphragm breathing to fully oxygenate our tissues.</p>
<p>Get some exercise. Do some yoga. Start breathing properly all the time. Lay on the floor with a book on your stomach. Begin breathing by pushing the book up and sucking in air to the bottom of your lungs. Continue breathing by filling the lungs fully and expanding your chest. Reverse the process on exhaling. This &#8220;belly breathing&#8221; will fully oxygenate your body to help make it less friendly to cancer cells, like shining sunlight on a vampire.</p>
<p>DAY 17: CHANGE THE UNDERLYING CAUSE</p>
<p>No one with a headache is suffering from a deficiency of aspirin. And no one with cancer has a deficiency of chemo or radiation. While these therapies might temporarily reduce tumor burden, they do not change the underlying cause of the disease.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones might be suffering from metastatic breast cancer because, in her case, she is still hurting from a hateful divorce of 2 years ago, which drives her catecholamines into a stress mode and depresses her immune system; she goes to bed on a box of high sugar cookies each night; she has a deficiency of fish oil, zinc, and vitamin E; and she has an imbalance of estrogen and progesterone in her body. Her oncologist may remove the breasts, give her Tamoxifen to bind up estrogen, and administer chemo and radiation; but none of these therapies deals with the underlying causes of the disease. And it will come back unless these driving forces for the disease are reversed.</p>
<p>Find a nutritionally-oriented doctor (listed in the back of this book) and determine what got you into this condition, which will provide a detailed map on how to get you out of this situation.</p>
<p>DAY 18: IS CANCER AN INFECTION?</p>
<p>There is compelling evidence that some or many cancers are advanced infections. Medline literature shows us that stomach cancer is often from the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, liver cancer from the infection hepatitis, cervical cancer from the infection human papilloma virus, and more. Hence, the need to address the infection is crucial in reversing the cancer. Yeast (fungi), virus, bacteria, mycoplasma, and parasites are among the critters that dwell within us and can create life-threatening diseases, like cancer. There are over 400,000 different strains of yeast, of which 400 can cause diseases in humans. Yeast is the &#8220;undertaker and the ecologist&#8221;, decomposing all of life back to mother earth. Unfortunately, due to lowered vitality we are becoming premature victims of yeast and other infections. Just like wolves attack the weakest of the herd, opportunistic pathogens attack the weakest of cells within our body. Your mission is to make your body so full of wellness that there is no room for illness.</p>
<p>Take a simple urine test to see if you have a yeast overgrowth (Great Plains Labs 913-341-8949) or blood test (ImmmunoSciences 310-657-1077) to see if you have other infections. Your doctor will then:</p>
<ul>
<li>kill the infectious organism with prescription medication and/or nutrition supplements</li>
<li>starve the yeast, by eating a diet that lowers simple carbohydrate intake</li>
<li>make the environment uncomfortable for the infectious agent, by bolstering your body&#8217;s defense mechanisms</li>
</ul>
<p>DAY 19: BEATING CANCER SYMPTOMS</p>
<p>&#8220;If the heat don&#8217;t kill you then the humidity will.&#8221; &#8220;And if the cancer don&#8217;t kill you then the side effects will.&#8221; Actually, both are worthy of your attention. Nausea, depression, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, anemia, weakness, fatigue, pain, and more can be common side effects of cancer. Depending on how advanced your cancer is, your medical therapies being given, your general health, etc., you can reduce symptoms to a tolerable level. See chapter 27 in this book. This is crucial because some cancer patients just give up, after suffering too much for too long. Much of this suffering can be reduced by allopathic and naturopathic treatments. Pain and discomfort induce stress, which lowers immune functions, which can be a real show-stopper for cancer patients. Pain management is crucial for many cancer patients. Get help.</p>
<p>DAY 20: SELECTIVELY REDUCE TUMOR BURDEN</p>
<p>It is very likely that your body needs some help in removing 10 or 20 trillion cancer cells, in order to reduce tumor burden enough to get your own anti-cancer defenses up and running. Working with the information that you gathered on day 2 (know your options of treatment), begin the process of debulking your tumor. Surgery, chemo, radiation, immune therapies, and hyperthermia are all common options. The key here is &#8220;restrained&#8221; tumor debulking. Anyone can kill all the cancer cells in your body. A thimble full of arsenic will do the job. No more cancer cells. No more you.</p>
<p>Surgeons used to take the aggressive cowboy approach and remove all surrounding tissue near the tumor. Then they found that by removing too many lymph nodes, that lymphedema, or pooling of lymph fluid, could create such pain that amputation of limbs became necessary. &#8220;Remove the target organ&#8221; was the battle cry of many an oncology surgeon. The hemi-ectomy was the pinnacle of aggressive surgery, where the cancer patient with a sarcoma below the waist had the body removed from the waist down. The survival statistics of these poor victims were no different than sarcoma patients who did nothing. Pelvic exenteration, taking out all internal organs near the tumor, yielded no improvement in survival curves and a serious reduction in quality of life for the remaining months. &#8220;Maximum sub-lethal chemo&#8221; has been the mantra of many oncologists. Bring the patient to the therapeutic brink of death, and then salvage the patient if possible.</p>
<p>Find a doctor who will work with you on RESTRAINED tumor debulking. Just like the childhood fable of Goldilocks, you want a doctor to remove&#8211;not too much, not too little, but just the right amount of tumor mass. Your oncologist can be the beginning of your demise or can give your body some breathing room so that your natural host defense mechanisms can take over. Choose your doctor &#8220;wagon master&#8221; wisely.</p>
<p>DAY 21: ILLNESS AS A TEACHING TOOL</p>
<p>What have you learned since being diagnosed with cancer? How have your priorities changed? Do you see life differently? Do you appreciate sunsets and friends more? If so, then you are heading in the right direction toward healing. If not, then wake up.</p>
<p>In working with over 3,000 cancer patients individually and speaking to many thousands of cancer patients, there is a clear message in the appearance of a serious disease in anyone&#8217;s life. Illness can be an unavoidable teaching tool. You can ignore advice from friends and loved ones. But you cannot ignore a terminal diagnosis.</p>
<p>I have had my own health challenges and each has taught me much. We are here on this earth for a very limited amount of time. What are we doing with our precious time and talents? Are you a human being or a human doing? Do you hate more than you love? Take more than you give? See the glass as half empty rather than half full? Spend more time contemplating regrets than your dreams? Treat people with respect or victimize them? Understand your unique skills that the world needs?</p>
<p>Cancer is more than just a physical systemic disease. And it requires more than just good nutrition and medicine to cure. It is a wake up call of the highest magnitude. Cancer patients who heed the call become better people having experienced this acid bath, this gauntlet, this baptism of fire. Many a cancer patient has stood in front of an audience and said: &#8220;Cancer is the best thing that ever happened to me.&#8221; If you are nodding in agreement with this statement, then you are moving toward healing.</p>
<p>In Oriental language, &#8220;crisis&#8221; is written with two characters: one meaning &#8220;danger&#8221;, the other character meaning &#8220;opportunity&#8221;. Cancer is truly a dangerous disease. Nearly 600,000 Americans die from this disease annually. Yet, for thousands of cancer patients, the disease has forced them into rearranging their priorities and lifestyle. Respect your body, your &#8220;temple of the Holy Spirit&#8221;. Fill your mind and your hours so full of joy, passion, helpfulness, music, laughter, play, worship, thanksgiving, friends, family, and your work that there is no room left for cancer in your life. A diamond is nothing more than a piece of coal that was put under a lot of pressure. You can become a diamond through the healing of your cancer.</p>
<p>PATIENT PROFILE: BEAT ENDSTAGE TUBERCULOSIS</p>
<p>True story. The number one cause of death throughout most of the 19th century was tuberculosis. Galen Clark went to Yosemite Valley to die of endstage tuberculosis at age 42 in the fall of 1856. His doctor told him that coughing up chunks of his lungs meant he had up to 2-6 months to live. There was no cure for this disease. Clark reasoned that &#8220;If I&#8217;m going to die soon, then I&#8217;m going to die in Yosemite, the prettiest place I&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221; He got happy. Scientists now tell us that happiness brings on the flow of endorphins, which supercharge our immune system and may slow down cancer.</p>
<p>Next, Galen Clark carved his own tombstone, thus accepting his mortality, a ritual that would give us all a better appreciation of our finite time on earth. He then started eating what was available in Yosemite in those days; clean and lean wild game, mountain trout, nuts, berries, vegetables, and lots of clean water. No sugar and no dairy products. He then began doing what he wanted to do, hiking and creating trails, in the place he treasured the most, Yosemite Valley. He didn’t die 6 months later, but rather 54 years later, just shy of his 96th birthday. He bolstered his “non-specific host defense mechanisms” with good thoughts and good nutrition.</p>
<p>Our bodies want to be well. There is an innate wisdom within all of life that knows how to fix disease. No one has to tell the scab on your hand how to heal properly. Your body knows what to do. We just have to give our body the proper physical and metaphysical resources to do its job right while purging our systems of toxins that inhibit healing.</p>
<p>Feed your mind the good thoughts of music, beauty, laughter, play, art, and friends; share a glass of wine or a cup of tea at sunset, and discuss the events of the day with a loved one. Feed your heart the good feelings of love, forgiveness, confidence in your abilities, a sense of purpose in your life, and a trusting relationship with your Creator. And feed your body good nutrients through diet and supplements, thus providing your body the raw materials that it needs to rebuild itself. You can recover from your cancer.</p>

			<div class="postBody"><p>Posted by James Ong</p>
<p>I have just read a short paper on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why you should not get the flu shot</span>, written by Dr. Joseph Mercola, who runs the world&#8217;s most popular website on natural health, visted by millions of people every day.  Much of what he says in the paper applies to the H1N1 vaccine as well.</p>
<p>Click here to download his paper:  <a href="http://balmofgilead.info/Flu-Shot.pdf">http://balmofgilead.info/Flu-Shot.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Together with Barbara Loe Fisher, founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (USA), Dr. Mercola hosted an audio presentation on the H1N1 flu hoax.  I strongly urge everyone to listen to it and learn why there is no compelling reason to fear the H1N1 influenza or get the vaccine:</p>
<p><a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/10/27/Obama-Declares-Swine-Flu-Emergency.aspx">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/10/27/Obama-Declares-Swine-Flu-Emergency.aspx</a></p>
<p>He has just launched a website specifically to warn people about the H1N1 flu vaccine and post updates on this crisis: </p>
<p><a href="http://swineflu.mercola.com/sites/swineflu/home.aspx">http://swineflu.mercola.com/sites/swineflu/home.aspx</a></p>
<p>Dr. Mercola is a Christian and osteopathic doctor.  Although he suggests yoga and meditation as ways to reduce stress, I would advise Christians to explore alternatives such as Pilates, exercise and Christian meditation as effective stress management techniques instead.</p>
<p>Finally, for this post, here are two Powerpoint/Flash slide presentations (with audio) from Neil Z. Miller, founder and president of ThinkTwice Global Vaccine Institute:</p>
<p>On the influenza vaccine:  <a href="http://www.thinktwice.com/flu_show.htm">http://www.thinktwice.com/flu_show.htm</a>.</p>
<p>On the link between vaccination and autism:  <a href="http://www.thinktwice.com/aut_show.htm">http://www.thinktwice.com/aut_show.htm</a>.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this:  vaccines are not safe.  They are medical procedures that carry risks of injury.  Hence, we need to make an informed choice whether the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks.</p>

			<div class="postBody"><p>Posted by James Ong</p>
<p>Well barely half a year after the world woke up to the threat of another potentially dangerous flu bug &#8211; the H1N1 viral flu bug &#8211; pharmaceutical companies have been working overnight to come up with vaccines for it and these have become available worldwide even as I write.  Our Ministry of Health has ordered 1,000,000 shots of it and are now offering these to first of all, frontline healthcare workers and next to the polyclinics and finally to private clinics.  It appears that there may not be enough to go around, so hurry!  If you want a shot, better tell your doctor about it and he will reserve stocks for you, so says the MoH.  But should you get the vaccine?</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="j0185155" src="http://pinkofhealth.biz/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/j0185155-300x202.jpg" alt="j0185155" width="300" height="202" />It costs anywhere between S$20 to S$30 to get a vaccine shot, similar to the regular flu shot.  I guess the ones that will be laughing all the way to the banks are the pharmaceutical companies.  Just do the mathematics.   A million doses at say, S$29 per dose (that&#8217;s what the polyclinics are charging), and that works out to S$29,000,000.  If they manage to convince the whole population to get the shots, then multiply that by four times:  more than S$100,000,000.</p>
<p>What we need to know that the H1N1 flu is not any more lethal than regular flu.  In the tropics, with strong sunlight, the flu virus doesn&#8217;t even survive long.  The number of deaths worldwide so far has been very, very small (about 5,000 according to the WHO, assuming those figures are reliable), despite all the fear-mongering and the fact that people have not been vaccinated against it.  In Singapore, those who died from H1N1 were either already immune-compromised or had other medical complications.  Did you know that more people die of malaria in the world each year than the flu (about 1,000,0000, that&#8217;s 100 times more)?  How come governments are not committing billions of dollars to protect the vulnerable from malaria?  How come we do not read much about the disease at all in the popular press?  And do take note that vaccines and flu drugs like Tamiflu and Relenza carry risks.  The evidence that they really work is scanty at best.  Besides, did you know that you can nourish and support your immune system so that you can fight off many types of infections?  I for one have not taken any cold or flu medication for 8 years.  So who says that you need vaccines and drugs to fight the flu?</p>
<p>Before you consider going for a H1N1 vaccine shot, I think it is advisable that you take a look at these videos by Dr. Lorraine Day (some of the things she says will probably shock you):</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s remember God&#8217;s promises to protect his children from pestilence:</p>
<p>Psalm 91:1-16  He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.  2 I will say to the LORD, &#8220;My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.&#8221;  3 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence.  4 He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.  5 You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,  6 nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.  7 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.  8 You will only look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked.  9 Because you have made the LORD your dwelling place &#8211; the Most High, who is my refuge -  10 no evil shall be allowed to befall you, no plague come near your tent.  11 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.  12 On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.  13 You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.  14 &#8220;Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name.  15 When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him.  16 With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.&#8221;</p>
