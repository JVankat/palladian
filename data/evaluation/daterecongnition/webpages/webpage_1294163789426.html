The title of this blog post should make the reader say "DUH!&nbsp;Any piece of writing that is going to be submitted for publication (even a blog post) should be edited.

&nbsp;Fact-checking is also extremely important, but that's going to be another blog post.


No one is going to get the lead perfect the first time writing it, and if someone thinks that the lead (first sentence for those who didn't know) written the first time is good enough then that person is incorrect.

When writing an article that just has a direct/summary lead (just answering the who, what, where, when) then maybe the lead doesn't need to be worked on as hard, but for indirect/delayed leads (will be explained later) the lead needs to be worked on.

The first draft of any sort of post (article or blog post, but mostly an article written by a journalist) should not be the only draft done before submitting for publication.

For this method we will use an Unbound Text Box to enter the search key value and a Command Button to click and find the record.

										In the first part of this Article, we were using the saved Bookmarks to revisit the earlier visited records one by one to take a second look, if it became necessary, to ascertain the accuracy of edited information. The Function myBookMarks() that we have created for this purpose can be added with one more Option, (along with 1=Save Bookmark, 2=retrieve Bookmarks, 3=initialize Bookmark List) to display all the edited records together in Datasheet View. But, this method has some side effects and must be aware of it to implement some work around methods in such situations. Here, we will try that with the Order Details Table. In the last example we were using the Bookmark Index Number and OrderID number values as a guide to cross check with the retrieved record. Several Products can be ordered under the same Purchase Order and all Products under the same Order will bear the same OrderIDs too.  If OrderIDs are alone used in a Query Criteria to retrieve the records then all records with t...</span>

										You want to edit information on 25 records on the Form randomly.  You will open the main data editing Form.  Search for the record by entering the Key Value to find (say Employee Code or OrderID Value) in the Find (Ctrl+F)  control and edit the record when found on the Form.  This procedure is repeated for all 25 records for the first time because you don&#39;t have any other choice to find and edit the information.But, the information you have changed is very critical and any mistakes in them may lead to serious issues.  Mistakes can easily creep-in when you go through the finding and editing procedure in a hurry. It is important that you should have a second look at each record to verify and ensure the accuracy of changes. Going through the same procedure to find all those 25 records again by displaying the Find control, keying in the Key Values and clicking on the Find button to reach the required record is not as enjoyable as it did for the first time.

										The Best Home Video Editing SoftwareBy Lance Carr
One of the key, overriding points to keep in mind throughout the selection process is, "What is it that I am I REALLY going to do with the video editing software that I choose?" The answer to that question has to remain uppermost in your mind when selecting the best video editing software for you. It is easy to get distracted by all the "bells and whistles" on offer but the reality is that many of those features will ultimately prove useless to you.
All of the major home video editing software companies offer camcorder to DVD video editing solutions that make them almost inseparable from each other. So concentrate on what you REALLY need.

										The title is misleading because to imply that there are 'rules' for any creative process is to put a cage around creative exploration. But, there are certainly principles, paradigms, methodologies and frameworks that have been proven to work and its these that can form a solid basis for every editor in building meaningful, dramatic and engaging sequences.Two Editors/Theorists who have been so bold as to present a set of 'Rules' are Walter Murch (most famous for editing Apocalypse Now and the Godfather Films) and Edward Dymtryk (a prolific filmmaker and academic). These two sets of 'rules' should inform the framework for measuring the reasoning and intent behind each cut you make on the timeline. It's not a case of agreeing with them all but of asking the questions these 'rules' pose to come to a more refined understanding of your own editing process and an embedded approach to the pragmatics of continuity.Edward Dymtryk.
