<h2>Activity 12<br>

Transnational Pollution:  Why Are You Dumping on Me?

</h2>

<p>Adapted from "Transnational Pollution: Why Are You Dumping on Me?" in  

<cite>Global Issues for the 90s.</cite>&nbsp;&nbsp;Denver: Center for Teaching 

International Relations, University of Denver, 1993.  pp 79-83.</p>



<h4 class="activity" id="gradeLevel">Grade Level</h4>

<p class="activity">Secondary</p>



<h4 class="activity" id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p class="activity">This lesson introduces the grandest and most threatening

problem of the global environment-transnational pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow 

of pollutants across national boundaries has confirmed that pollution does not 

recognize geographical boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, environmental degradation 

in one country can spread to another, reconfirming that now more than ever, the 

health of the global environment is the responsibility of all nations, whether 

vast or small, rich or poor.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this lesson is to 

familiarize students with the different types of transnational pollution, and to

give them an opportunity to role play in a hypothetical case of transnational 

pollution on the Danube River.&nbsp;&nbsp;The story, "Why Are You Dumping on 

Me?" is reminiscent of the 1986 Sandoz chemical plant fire in Switzerland that 

dumped thirty tons of pesticides, dyes, and fungicides into the Rhine 

River.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this activity, students should be encouraged to offer 

solutions to this clear and present danger.</p>



<h4 class="activity" id="objective">Teacher/Student Objective</h4>

<p class="activity">The major goal of this activity is to make student 

cognizant that an incident in one nation may well have serious environmental 

consequences for other nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, it will also give 

students an opportunity to play complex roles that are meaningful and 

consequential to global concerns.</p>



<h4 class="activity" id="gaugingUnderstanding">Gauging Student Understanding</h4>

<p class="activity">The progress indicators cited reflect desirable end goals.  

Teachers should be prepared to use a wide variety of observational, testing 

and authentic achievement evaluation measures in judging the progress of 

students.</p>



<p>By assuming specific points-of-view in a role playing exercise, students will

reveal their ability to develop and defend a position.&nbsp;&nbsp;Logical 

reasoning and rational argument will be judged through the use of a scaled 

evaluation sheet administered by a trained group of students.</p>



<h4 class="activity" id="suggestedMaterials">Suggested Materials</h4>

<ul class="noTop">

	<li class="noIndent2">Copies of <a

		href="../handouts/glHandout12A.html">Handout 12A</a>,

		Why Are You Dumping on Me? and Role Objectives.

	<li class="noIndent2">Large sheets of butcher paper.

	<li class="noIndent2">Felt-tip pens.

</ul>



<h4 class="activity" id="processes">Initial Data for Consideration

	and/or Process</h4>

<p class="activity">Begin the lesson by encouraging students to give examples of

transnational pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might need to define "transnational" for

them, extending or going across national, political or geographical 

boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some examples might be airborne pollution like acid rain 

that originate in one country (the US) and pollute another 

(Canada).&nbsp;&nbsp;Emissions from factories and automobiles in the form of 

carbon dioxide are also carried by the wind across national 

boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Radiation leaks from nuclear power plants (Chernobyl, 

April 1986) or nuclear tests in the atmosphere can also be carried in the same 

way.&nbsp;&nbsp;River pollution can begin in one country and flow into another

(the Danube, Rhine, and Meuse rivers).&nbsp;&nbsp;And the destruction of 

habitat of migratory birds and animals can also be considered transnational 

pollution.</p>



<p>Divide the class into groups of six.&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain that each group will 

consist of the same six individuals:<br>

President of Meinhold Chemical Company; a German government official; a Czech 

environmental activist; a Rumanian river boat captain; an official of the

Austrian Ministry of Public Health; and a United Nations official.</p>



<p>DistributeHandout&nbsp;&nbsp;Remind students to read the handout from

the perspective of their role.&nbsp;&nbsp;Review the objectives of each

role.&nbsp;&nbsp;An optional method is to divide the class into six groups,

each group with one role.</p>



<p>Give each group a large piece of butcher paper, and explain that the 

objective of this activity is to develop solutions and a course of action in 

response to the fire at the Meinhold Chemical Company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remind them 

that transnational pollution, in all its forms, is a very serious environmental 

problem and that by its nature, will affect more than one nation at a 

time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, let them know that each group will present their course 

of action to the whole class.&nbsp;&nbsp;The course of action taken by each 

group must take the role objectives of individual members into 

consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain that when conflict occurs (and it will) 

between members of the group over a proper course of action, they should be 

encouraged to compromise and alter their positions to reach a group 

consensus.&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct each group to record their course of action on the 

poster paper.</p>



<p>After all the groups have finished developing their solutions and a course of

action, ask a representative or team of representatives from each group to 

present their course of action to the entire class.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have each group 

hang their posting paper so it can be seen by the whole class.</p>



<p>Facilitate a discussion on the similarities and differences among the various

group ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain that the goal of this discussion is to develop 

one course of action that the entire class approves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, 

compromises will have to be made.&nbsp;&nbsp;Record the final solutions and 

course of action on a piece of posting paper that is visible to the entire 

class.</p>



<p>The activity can be concluded by focusing a discussion on the following 

questions: 

<ul class="noTop">

 	<li class="noIndent" STYLE="list-style-type:circle;">What were some of 

		the conflicts that your group experienced developing your course

		of action?

	<li class="noIndent" STYLE="list-style-type:circle;">What difficulties 

		would different nations face when deciding on a joint course of 

		action after an environmental catastrophe?

	<li class="noIndent" STYLE="list-style-type:circle;">What can be done to 

		prevent further instances of transnational pollution?

	<li class="noIndent" STYLE="list-style-type:circle;">Is one type of 

		transnational pollution worse than another?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is one 

		type more common?

	<li class="noIndent" STYLE="list-style-type:circle;">Who should be 

		forced to pay for environmental clean-up: government or private 

		industry?

	<li class="noIndent" STYLE="list-style-type:circle;">How can nations 

		work together to better our environment?  

</p></ul>

at its core some kind of controversy.</p>
