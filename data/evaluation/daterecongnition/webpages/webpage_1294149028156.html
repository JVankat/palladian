<li>Mobia’s treadles let you WALK forward like a <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/">treadmill</a></span>. Since they move independently, you also STEP UP like a stair climber. Combine these two actions and you get an intense workout with the smooth, LOW-IMPACT motion of an elliptical.</li>
<li>With a maximum speed of 4 mph, Mobia’s 3-in-1 motion gets results even at a walking pace, helping to reduce the impact on joints and muscles.</li>
<li>Activate more of your lower body and core muscles simply by walking. As you step forward and up, the treadle rises to meet your foot. Your natural movement pushes the treadle down against the resistance.</li>
<li>In a study conducted at New York’s Adelphi University, Mobia™ modality burned up to 2 times more calories in 30 minutes than a treadmill at the same speed! </li>
<li>This innovative 3-in-1 technology is available <strong>exclusively</strong> from Nautilus ––don’t accept imitations!</li>
<li>Mobia’s sleek, intuitive console design lets you take control of your workout with a push of a button. </li>
<li><strong>Included Essentials: </strong>Every Mobia™ comes with must-have essentials for your workout including a Telemetry Chest Strap that wirelessly monitors heart rate and the specialized Nautilus® Nutrition Plan and Introduction to <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">fitness</a></span> Guide.</li>
<li>With Mobia™, you get a fantastic, full-body workout in just 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Use Mobia™ for just 30 minutes a day, 3 times a week, and after just 6 weeks, you&#8217;ll be amazed at the change you see in your body­­––flatter abs, leaner thighs, tighter “glutes” and lots of extra energy.∞</li>
<li>The secret is the way Mobia™ combines a calorie-burning, cardio <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> with a muscle-toning leg and core workout. You get in the fat-burning zone fast…and stay there. </li>
<li>You can burn calories and tone muscles up to <em>twice</em> as fast as you would on a treadmill because Mobia™ activates more of the muscles in your lower body and core.</li>
<li>With Mobia™, you don&#8217;t run, you walk. There is less stress on your back and joints, making your workout feel easier. Mobia™ provides an effective, efficient workout that you&#8217;ll actually enjoy.</li>
<p>Nautilus brings state-of-the-art gym quality into your home with Mobia™. It&#8217;s the perfect evolution of fitness technology and at-home convenience.

<p>First things first, it&#8217;s important that you understand something. In terms of fat loss, your stomach is the most stubborn part of your body and generally the last place fat will begin to fall off of. With that said, however, if you implement a proven <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight loss</a></span> strategy you will begin to see the results you desire. Use these 3 strategies to help you to <strong>get rid of stomach fat fast</strong>.</p>
<p>1.	<strong>Interval Training</strong> - As you probably already know, <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> is a crucial element to any successful <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> loss venture. In my opinion, one method of exercise stands out above the rest. The method I&#8217;m talking about is interval training, specifically, HIIT which stands for High Intensity Interval Training. Basically, this type of exercise is structured so that you work for a very high intensity for very short intervals. By doing this, you make sure you&#8217;re always working as hard as you can but also obtaining the required rest.</p>
<p>2.	<strong>Reward Yourself</strong> - For the most part, when you&#8217;re dieting you won&#8217;t be able to enjoy the foods that you have in the past. However, you should reward yourself every once in a while. A great way to do this is to pick out a food you would have eaten in the past and have it once every fortnight. For example, you might decide to have a couple of slices of pizza every second Sunday night. By allowing yourself to cheat every once and a while you give yourself something to look forward to so you&#8217;re less likely to cheat throughout the week.</p>
<p>3.	<strong>Set Specific Goals</strong> - You need to be specific with your goal setting. For example, setting the goal of losing 30 pounds by anytime next year is not a good goal. If you were to change that to, I want to lose x amount of pounds by y date, you are in a better position. If you don&#8217;t give yourself anything specific to aim for the chances are you&#8217;re not going to work as hard as you can. Additionally, it&#8217;s important that when doing this you also set up realistic goals that are achievable.</p>

<p>Well as a personal trainer and certified nutritionist I know what works when it comes to <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight loss</a></span> and one of the rising nutrients of today&#8217;s <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">diet</a></span> is protein. Protein is the building block in our body and is actually the only needed nutrient because without we would die as carbohydrates and fats can be manufactured from this energy source as well.</p>
<p><strong>Protein has been well known for its <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> loss abilities</strong> and a diet higher in protein will actually increase fat burning effectiveness. Protein is the only energy source that has been shown to increase metabolism which in turn will burn calories at a much higher rate and therefore lead to an increase in weight loss but it is also important to know how much and what source of protein is best for weight loss.</p>
<p>If you are trying to <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">lose weight</a></span> you should include protein in every meal as this will keep your insulin levels down which is the fat storing hormone. Three times a day you should have a protein serving about the size of your palm and the rest should be relatively smaller amounts in the form of nuts or dairy.</p>
<p>The best sources for protein that also contribute to weight loss are breast fillet chicken, lean beef, skim dairy, cottage cheese, raw nuts, eggs and salmon. All of these protein sources contain the highest quality protein but also contain beneficial nutrients like healthy fats which aid in fat loss and b vitamins which help you to get more energy out of food which is also important when dieting.</p></div>

<p>Safe <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight loss</a></span> has been defined and redefined many times over in the past few decades. People that are losing the <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> want to know just <strong>how much weight loss per week is considered safe</strong>. Most <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">fitness</a></span> experts, dietitians, and doctors will tell you that two pounds per week is the safest. But does this apply to everyone?</p>
<p>Actually, two pounds per week doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be the maximum amount of weight you can lose in a week safely. This is merely just a recommendation and nothing more than that. This number is primarily based on a normal or average number that most people would use as a benchmark. You should take into factor your current <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">health</a></span> situation and the amount of time and what kind of work ethic you can put into your weight loss efforts.</p>
<p>For instance, people that carry more body fat will be able to lose well more than two pounds a week safely. A good rule of measure to use is the one-percent rule. You can lose up to one-percent of your body weight a week safely. So this means if you weigh 250 pounds, you should lose about 2.5 pounds per week.</p>
<p>Another thing you need to consider is what kind of weight you are going to be losing. Your body is composed of several pieces of matter that all come off with varying degrees of effort. Water weight is easily shed by simply sweating it off. Some people can lose over 10 pounds in one day by fasting and sweating! This though is not a true testament as to getting rid of fat and keeping the weight off.</p>
<p>Your body is also composed of muscle mass and fat. Generally speaking, gaining more muscle will help you lose your body fat and drop overall body weight as well. The whole myth about muscle weighing more than fat is merely that&#8230;a myth! Five pounds of muscle weighs the same as five pounds of fat, duh. Sure muscle is more dense, but adding muscle will get rid of your fat and your body will look and feel less flabby and weak.</p>
<p>Losing more than two pounds per week is certainly attainable and safe, but keep in mind that it is always easier to lose more weight in the beginning stages than it will be later on into your weight loss plan. Some people get discouraged when the numbers all of the sudden begin to become smaller each week. Be aware of this and continue on with your plan.</p>
<p>If you are not happy with how things are going with your weight loss plan and want to lose more than two pounds a week, simply cut back even more on your daily calories. This and an all around workout plan will certainly make your weight loss goals attainable.</p></div>

<p>There is a very simple mathematical equation that defines <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight loss</a></span>. It is as follows;<br />
<strong>calories in &gt; calories out = <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> loss</strong>.</p>
<p>As you can see, in order to <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">lose weight</a></span> you must consume fewer calories than you use. It sounds very simple in theory but in order to do so successfully you must understand how many calories you&#8217;re using each day and then create a <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">diet</a></span> that will have you eating less than the amount you&#8217;re using.</p>
<p>There are many great calculators on the internet available which you can find by simply searching for, &#8220;Calorie Calculator&#8221; on Google or any other search engine. For the sake of simplicity, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re using 2000 calories a day. In order to lose weight, you need to be consuming less than 2000 calories a day. It&#8217;s recommended that you only lower your daily calories by 500 so in this case you would have to create a diet that had a total of 1500 calories a day.</p>
<p>The reason we get this number is because there are 3500 calories in one pound. So if we burn 500 calories a day, we will lose one pound a week. If you wanted to lose more you would need to have more of a caloric deficit, although, I personally would never consume less than 1200 calories a day. You can consult with your doctor as to the lowest amount of calories you can eat.</p>
<p>So from here, we would create a diet that consisted of 1500 calories. These calories would come from protein, carbohydrates and fats. It&#8217;s important to note that whilst there are 4 calories in one gram of protein and one gram of carbohydrate, there are 9 calories in one gram of fat. Additionally, you will also want to create a balanced diet. The usual balance is around about 40-40-20 which is 40% protein, 40% carbohydrate and 20% fat.</p>
<p>As I said above, the actual amount of calories you need to consume will be different to the numbers outlined in this article. The reason for this is because everyone is a different size and will also <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> differently. Use the calculator that is linked to above and go from there.</p>

<p>Want to dispel one popular myths about cellulite. But first let me ask you, how long do you have to be on that evil elliptical machine at 5 MPH to burn off a choco taco ice cream dessert?</p>
<p>Hint: According to the wrapper on my tasty treat last night, my little choco taco walloped me with 290 calories. So how long to burn off that 290 calories? Give up? Roughly 40 minutes. That&#8217;s right, 40 minutes. And will that 40 minutes remove that taco from your thighs, legs or tummy? In my experience&#8230; no! In fact, trying to spot reduce fat or cellulite is futile.</p>
<p>One of my clients was just telling me that he recalls seeing a one time Guinness World Record holder for sit ups and surprisingly, he had BELLY FAT. Couldn&#8217;t see a six pack anywhere.</p>
<p>Now, you don&#8217;t have to believe me. Really. It won&#8217;t hurt my feelings. Will you try this though? Instead of doing lunges until you fall on your face, try doing this one simple thing. It won&#8217;t even make you break a sweat.</p>
<p>What it will do is get your body out of starvation mode and what THAT will do for you is tell your metabolism to stop turning every calorie that passes your lips to turn into fat and cellulite.</p>
<p>For the next 3 months I want you to eat every time you feel hungry. No more skipping breakfast. If you need an afternoon snack then have one for goodness sake. At the end of the 3 months&#8230; take a look at your legs and thighs in a mirror. You&#8217;ll probably be shocked. You may even wonder how your legs look so much better, so fast and without a single <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span>.</p>
<p>The trick? Your body doesn&#8217;t think it needs to store fat because you are NOT in starvation mode. Cool, huh? But, you can actually watch it happen faster than 3 months.</p>

<p>I like to call the core muscles the &#8220;forgotten&#8221; muscles because most of us don&#8217;t even know where they&#8217;re located or what they do. Many do not realize the importance of developing and maintaining strong core muscles. We hear about doing crunches or trying the latest ab <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> machine to get flatter abs or a sexy mid-section, but the core muscles are made up of much more than just the abdominal muscles.</p>
<p>When I was growing up, we were taught to do full blown sit ups. Years later, sit ups were deemed potentially harmful to your spine, so the ever popular crunches took the place of sit ups when I worked my abdominal muscles.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t heard of core muscles until I started incorporating yoga and core workouts into my <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">fitness</a></span> routines. I soon learned about the core and where these muscles were located by doing poses such as plank, superman, banana, and side bridge.</p>
<p>The core muscles are located primarily between your lower rib cage and knees. The abdominal and oblique muscles are part of the core, but the lower back, pelvic, and hamstring muscles cannot be forgotten. Think about what muscles are used when you stand up from a sitting position, when you bend over, or when you swing a bat. The muscles used in these movements are core muscles.</p>
<p>As you might&#8217;ve guessed from the visualization above, core muscles play an important role in key body movements. They also stabilize the spine, maintain your center of gravity, and form your posture. You&#8217;ve probably heard about how you must work not only your quadriceps when strengthening your legs but also the hamstrings?</p>
<p>Well, think about what little good it actually does to just do crunches working only the abdominal muscles now that you understand the function of these muscles. You have to strengthen the back and hamstring muscles as well, so your strength is throughout your core.</p>
<p>One of the most important reasons for strengthening and maintaining strong core muscles is to ensure a balance throughout your core to prevent injuries. You&#8217;ll also find doing daily activities much easier as your body is better prepared to handle the workloads of bending, twisting, balancing, walking, and holding your body upright.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, you will develop firmer abs and a slimmer mid-section. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with wanting to look great! Our desire for tight, tone abdominal muscles is why the fitness industry has so many ab exercise machines, attachments, and accessories. My bonus to you? Save yourself some money. Most effective core exercises are performed using only the <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> and position of your body!</p>

<p>The <strong>cost of the Ab Circle Pro</strong> is tough for some to handle. At a price tag of over $200 it can make it a harder decision to buy this product. There is a great debate if this product is a scam or the real deal. I am not going to discuss this debate in this article but rather discuss if the $200 is real value or a money grab.</p>
<p>First, the machine is made of a metal alloy which makes for a lighter <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span>. Having a lighter weight makes this machine more portable and easy to move.</p>
<p>Second, there are some complaints about the knee pads on the machine is causing users pain. Some people have used added padding to combat this problem while others have stopped using the machine. The company could change the padding to a softer material but that simply depend if the market demands it.</p>
<p>Third, the <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> does what it is suppose to. The machine works the abs and midsection. The claims about your thighs getting a workout might be a little stretched. You have to consider that the positioning of your body does not fully allow the use the legs to get a complete leg workout. The three minutes a day claim is also a little off. If you are starting off using this product for the first time then yes three minutes a day is a good start. If you are looking for a cardio workout then three minutes a day needs to be extended to 15-30 minutes.</p>
<p>The Ab Circle Pro cost is a little much however when compared to other machines of similar nature the price seems to be fair. One thing to consider is this machine should be integrated into a complete workout program. Using this machine alone will not deliver the six-pack abs that the infomercials will have you think. If adding this to your workout program is your intentions then it seems to be a fair price for the product you get.</p>

					<p>Nowadays everyone has become very <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">health</a></span> conscious. All of us want to lose <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> fast, look good and most importantly feel good. In today&#8217;s fast paced life, we are always on the go and don&#8217;t always have time to go to the gym. Though there are hundreds of choices in <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> equipments for <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/home-gyms/">home gyms</a></span>, one of the best and effective ways to <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">lose weight</a></span> at home is by using an <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/exercise-bikes/">exercise bike</a></span>. Many different exercise equipments are introduced daily in the market, but because of its infinite benefits, <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/exercise-bikes/">exercise bikes</a></span> are always in demand. Calories burned using exercise bikes varies from person to person, their speed, <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">fitness</a></span> level and their weight.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of exercise bikes, but the principal kinds are recumbent exercise bike and stationery exercise bike. A recumbent exercise is one which has a support or a back rest. It is more comfortable as compared to the stationery bike though a stationery bike can be more user friendly. No matter what kind of exercise bike you choose, biking is a great way to tone up and get rid of that extra fat. It also strengthens your heart and lung capacity. It is a great exercise for anyone, because you can decide what level you want to workout at, the speed and choose from the various programs like sprint, pedal, uphill or even the random programs which will definitely prove to be quite interesting and yet beneficial. But most importantly, while using an exercise bike, calories burned are almost the same as while using a <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/">treadmill</a></span> and definitely easier and fun than a treadmill, because you can watch your favorite soap opera or even read while cycling, so you don&#8217;t feel like you are actually working out. These are just a few of exercise bikes benefits.</p>
<p>Some bikes do have an inbuilt calorie counter. But always remember to enter your weight before starting the workout. Some machines don&#8217;t ask for the weight, but you should not trust the calories burnt in such a case, because your weight plays a crucial role in calculating exercise bike calories. However, if your bike does not have a calorie counter, you can calculate it online. There are tons of calculators online, which are very precise in calculating calories burned. While calculating the calories burned by using an exercise bike, you have to take into consideration your weight, height, time of workout and the speed at which you have worked out.</p>
<p><strong>Some Tips For Maximum Exercise Bike Calorie Loss</strong></p>
<p>* For maximum calories loss, it is important to know what is the best exercise bike workout that is appropriate for you.<br />
* While biking, it is important to increase your speed gradually. Do not keep your speed constant.<br />
* You should set out goals for yourself, for example, try cycling a particular distance each time. After a while you will be able to cover the same distance in less time.<br />
* Try and use resistance in your workout. It will push you to your limit and you will lose maximum calories.<br />
* The most important tip is to use intervals. They can be high intensity intervals or low intensity intervals. For example, you should ride your bike as fast as you can, for about 15 seconds and then ride it slowly for 45 seconds and then again fast for 15 seconds and so on. Here even though you will be riding slowly for 45 seconds, it will actually be an active rest.<br />
* It is very important to be realistic with your goals. If you are a beginner, its good that you are excited, but you have to remember that you are not Lance Armstrong&#8230; well not yet anyway! For your long term success, it is better to start off slow.<br />
* Figure out a time of the day when you work the best. Some people are morning people while others are night owls. It&#8217;s best to exercise during that time, so that you are motivated and you will automatically lose more calories.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a fun, effective and easy way to lose weight, the perfect choice is an exercise bike. Calories burned while using an exercise bike will definitely motivate you to continue your hard work. So, now that you are ready to burn that extra fat, pedal away!</p>

<p>Elliptical trainers are consistently gaining popularity. What makes this particular <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> machine so popular? If you&#8217;ve worked out on them you already know, but if you haven&#8217;t you may want to give one a try to learn first hand. Probably the main reason they are so popular is because you can work both your upper and lower body at the same time. Some feel they are one of the most efficient types of <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/">fitness equipment</a></span>, so if you&#8217;re only able to have one piece of equipment many are choosing the elliptical.</p>
<p>Of course there are many other benefits of <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/elliptical-trainers/">elliptical trainers</a></span> making people want to have one in their home. Having home <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">fitness</a></span> equipment makes it easier for us to exercise on a regular basis. You don&#8217;t have to spend time driving to and from the gym and you can slip in a workout whenever you have a little extra time. But buying an elliptical is a big decision. If you want to get a quality machine it&#8217;s going to be an investment. Budget <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/elliptical-trainers/">ellipticals</a></span> can be more trouble than they are worth sometimes so it&#8217;s better to spend enough to get something decent. A good machine will be more comfortable to use and shouldn&#8217;t require as much maintenance.</p>
<p>One of the best brands you can buy is the Life Fitness Elliptical. Life Fitness has been designing innovative <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/">exercise equipment</a></span> for a long time. They have teams that study every aspect of their products, constantly trying to find ways to improve on their already high quality equipment. They constantly ask the question &#8220;how can this be better?&#8221; And Life Fitness <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/elliptical-trainers/">Ellipticals</a></span> are among their highly rated products.</p>
<p>They are well built and made to last. Life Fitness started making commercial gym equipment so they know how to make a piece of equipment that gets a lot of use and abuse. These machines are made for the serious user, but they have features that anyone will love and appreciate including separate, personalized programs for different users in the household. But these elliptical trainers aren&#8217;t cheap. If you&#8217;re serious about your workouts these are a great choice, but if you aren&#8217;t a regular user this may be more than you need if you don&#8217;t have the budget for it.</p>

<p>There are many great ways to workout, but my favorite is to combine shadow boxing, dumbbell, and bodyweight training. These workouts not only give me a great cardiovascular benefit, but they also help me burn fat and build lean muscle mass.</p>
<p>Shadow Boxing is a training method boxers and martial artists use when training for a fight. All you do is pretend that you&#8217;re boxing someone. I hate traditional cardio such as jogging and aerobics.</p>
<p>And so, I&#8217;ve chosen Shadow Boxing as my cardio method. My workouts are really easy to design. All I do is choose two bodyweight exercises and two dumbbell exercises. I&#8217;ll perform a bodyweight <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> for 5-20 repetitions, then perform a minute of shadowboxing.</p>
<p>Then I&#8217;ll move onto another exercise and repeat the pattern. Sometimes I like to call this kind of training, &#8220;Heart Training&#8221; because your heart rate will be going insane during the workout.</p>
<p>You can choose any form of cardio you wish. There are many interesting forms to choose from including jump roping and sledge hammer swings. Sledge hammer swings are where you hit a tire with a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>Beginners should start off with 2 exercises, alternating with a cardio movement. Advanced trainees can choose up to 4.</p>
<p>A great way to fit in this workout within a short period of time is perform as many rounds of the workout as possible within a time period. For example, lets say you only have 20 minutes to workout.</p>
<p>Set a timer for 20 minutes, then just move through the workout as fast as possible. Record how many total rounds you completed, then try to complete more rounds the following week that you attempt the workout.</p>

<p>In this article I&#8217;m going to show you the exact ways that will tell you <strong>how to get abs in a month</strong>. No more endless hours of jogging on a <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/">treadmill</a></span> and seeing no results, if it&#8217;s a sexy six pack you want, then you need to do it the right way!</p>
<p>Everyone has abs, but the thing is, if you can&#8217;t see them, there is a layer of belly fat covering them up. In order to know how to get abs in a month, you will need to burn that layer of fat off quick! Guess what though, doing long hours of boring cardio is not the way to achieve this! This is because jogging on a treadmill isn&#8217;t intense enough, and will take you much longer than a month to see great results. Focus on short, intense half hour sessions of cardio, such as swimming. Swimming works out the whole body and will burn away fat a thousand times quicker if you swim intensely for half an hour.</p>
<p>Once you have the right workout routine, you need to focus on another area if you want to learn how to get abs in a month, and that is your <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">diet</a></span>. Eating fatty foods is the biggest block to you getting a visible six pack, as all the empty calories from cakes and biscuits goes straight to the stomach and will cover up those abs you&#8217;re working so hard for! Aim to eat foods with a high protein content, which will help build muscle too.</p>
<p>Combining a good diet and workout routine is how to get abs in a month, and if you stay dedicated, you&#8217;ll definitely see results! Think how much better you&#8217;ll feel when you&#8217;re on a healthier diet, and have rock hard abs to show off to the world!</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you wish there was a way for you to <strong>enhance your Pilates exercises</strong>, so you could get more benefits from these? Indeed, there are various Pilates machines available including the Malibu Pilates Chair and the Pilates Power Gym. However, the best among all these machines is the <strong>Pilates Reformer Machine</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, this machine is so good that almost all Pilates instructors prefer to use this machine over other machines that are available. By strengthening your abdominal muscles, Pilates helps you get the greatest sense of <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">health</a></span> and wellness. The machine only helps enhance this sense of well being you feel.</p>
<p>Not only is this device effective, it is also very convenient to use as well. All you need to do is take a seat in the space indicated on the machine. Then you push and pull yourself back and forth as indicated by the device&#8217;s instructions. While you are sitting in a comfortable position, using the machine can really give you a workout.</p>
<p>How much you get out of the <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> depends on the amount of effort you put into it. However, not all Reformer Machines are made equal. There are various brands and types of these kinds of machines, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some machines even come with free tapes or DVDs with samples of Pilates exercises you can do using their machines.</p>
<p>Do not be fooled by fancy advertising. The best way to figure out which machine to buy is by researching about the different choices online. Finding a balance between price and function might be a bit difficult at first. But this is made easier by the numerous customer product reviews you can read online.</p>
<p>Basically, if a lot of customers and Pilates instructors (aside from the one&#8217;s starring in the promotional videos) recommend it then it must be worth your money. There are dozens of sites online from where you can read up on and purchase affordable machines.</p>

<p>Weider is one of the biggest names in the <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/home-gyms/">home gym</a></span> industry today. Not only because of the wide variety of their high quality equipment, but also due to the affordability of their units.</p>
<p><strong>Weider Home Gym Systems</strong></p>
<p>One best example of their <em><span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/home-gyms/">home gyms</a></span></em> is the <em>Weider Pro 9635</em>. This line has eight stations composed of a military press, leg press, vertical knee raise, leg developer, butterfly arms, high and low pulley system, and a bench press. This alone can allow you to perform various <em><span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/home-gyms/weider-home-gyms/">Weider home gym</a></span> exercises</em> with the numerous stations it has. Now, you can easily have a full body workout in the comforts of your home.</p>
<p>Another whole different Weider home gym <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> can be done with the Weider boxing gym. As boxing is an amazing way to get fit and healthy, this equipment is really ideal for those who want to get more than just exercise. This equipment has a good number of boxing features you can take advantage of. It is a complete set which includes a speed bag, a leg developer, a chest press, butterfly arms, a forty pound punching bag, and a low pulley.</p>
<p>However, if you want a grander home gym and you are willing to invest on it, the <em>Weider Platinum Plus</em> might just be the perfect one for you. With this home equipment, you will surely get the most out of your money as it is fully packed with amazing features. For one, it is a complete system, allowing you to choose where you should focus and what kind of exercise you want to do. You can choose from circuit training, strength training, or simply just burn fats and lose <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span>. However, if you can&#8217;t decide which one to do, you can always ask for help through the digital personal trainer, which is built in on the equipment. This system will help you decide which exercise you should do next to complete your training.</p>
<p>You are not likely to run out of <em>Weider home gym exercises</em>, as there are seventy-five routines you can do on the five stations of the equipment. This makes this equipment such a good deal, as it guarantees to work out every part of the body.</p>
<p>This Weider home gym system also allows you to personalize your workouts easily. Aside from the option in the digital console that tells you which exercise you should do next, you can also program the sets and number of repetitions you&#8217;d like to do for each exercise.</p>
<p>And, on top of all this, the Platinum Plus is foldable and has wheels so you can easily roll it away and store it when it&#8217;s not in use, making it ideal even for those who do not have much space at home.</p>
<p><strong>Buying Weider Home Gym Systems</strong></p>
<p>If you are planning on purchasing one of the Weider home gym systems, it is important to keep in mind some things. Before getting into a deal, make sure that the unit you are going to buy has all of the things you&#8217;ll need. This, however, will require you to know which exercises you will be doing yourself.</p>

					<p>The three uses for <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">fitness</a></span> <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/">treadmills</a></span> include <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight loss</a></span>, increase of strength, and general improvement of <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">health</a></span>.  Choosing to use them everyday can make you feel a lot better about yourself as far as your overall health is concerned. For this reason, more people are choosing to buy fitness treadmills to place inside of their own homes. Not all people are able to hand over $50.00 to $100.00 per month for expensive gym memberships and fancy personal trainers. Gradually this money will add up.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is decide what type of fitness <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/">treadmill</a></span> is going to suit your needs. There are basic treadmills and then there are those that come with extra features. Basic treadmills usually come with a timer, heart rate monitor, emergency stop, and speed adjustment system. <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/">Treadmills</a></span> come in different models that may include built-in accessories such as beverage holders and calorie counters as well as performance levels from walking, running, hill climbing, and cardio workouts. Some fitness treadmills even come with a built-in television and/or radio. It all depends on what you want. The most important thing is that it needs to be what you are able to afford. The most difficult part about all of this is finding cheap treadmills.</p>
<p>You will be amused to find that the prices of the treadmill  the shops in your own  town or city sell, can vary so much, with no relevance to each other. The high cost of fitness treadmills is a way retail companies increase their profits. You will probably pay something around $1000 to @250000 to $2500.00 for an average treadmill from a fitness retailer. Some people do not mind paying these outrageous prices, but others do not see this as being fair.</p>
<p>Shopping online gives you the advantage over shopping in your local town or city because you are able to compare prices at a glance and find the best deals on fitness treadmills. It is often possible to purchase this equipment directly from its manufacturer and this will save money because you will not have to pay the higher retail price. Shopping online for a treadmill that usually costs about $1500.00 is most likely to cost in a retail shop over $700 to $900.0000. Basically, you are paying for the actual treadmill and not the distributor&#8217;s paycheck.</p>
<p>Internet shopping also saves you time, as well as the bother of running around. Who really likes getting out there on Saturday&#8217;s and Sunday&#8217;s amongst the crowd, practically racing to the store trying to find the latest deals anyway? The hassle and the difficulty are too much in deed. Online shopping provides one with chances of latest deals all the seven days in a week. There are no lines to stand in and no traffic to get stuck in. You are left feeling at ease when you find fitness treadmills at reasonable prices, and the variety is endless. Write your payment method and address and the treadmill will be shipped at once.  Shopping is enjoyable and simple when it is done online, as it should be.</p>

Home <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/">treadmills</a></span> are suitable for walking, jogging, or running and they provide many features to enhance one&#8217;s workout routine. <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/reebok-treadmills/">Reebok treadmills</a></span>, manufactured by Icon Health and <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">fitness</a></span>, are a popular choice among exercise enthusiasts. Because they carry the Reebok name, these treadmills are typically associated with quality and regarded as a superior piece of <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/">fitness equipment</a></span>.</p>
<p>Reebok treadmills by Icon offer a gym quality treadmill for use at home. Consumers should be aware that the Reebok treadmills found in gyms and other fitness centers are not manufactured by Icon; only Reebok home use treadmills are manufactured by Icon. While Reebok treadmills may be a little more expensive than other treadmills with similar features, the staying power of Reebok and the reputation the company has forged for itself may well be worth the extra expense.</p>
<p>The average price range of a <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/reebok-treadmills/">Reebok treadmill</a></span> is between $1,000 and $2,000. Other companies may offer a similar treadmill at a lower cost, but in this economy consumers cannot be sure that a less reputable company will be around when services are needed in the future. With Reebok, consumers can be sure that their warranties will be guaranteed and the services their treadmills need will be available even several years from now.</p>
<p>Many of the Reebok treadmill models offer a 2.25 or 2.5 HP commercial-grade motor. These motors provide the power that consumers need, and they allow individuals to exercise for extended period of time while providing efficient, reliable, and uninterrupted operation. These models also offer either a 20&#8243; x 55&#8243; belt or a 20&#8243; x 60&#8243; belt. This means that individuals have both the room and they power they need to achieve an optimal workout.</p>
<p>Reebok treadmills allow users to adjust the intensity of their workouts. Some models have maximum speeds of 12 mph and inclines that adjust to 12%. These models also offered pre-programmed workout options and routines, and many have fans built into the console of the machine to keep users cool during their workout. Some even have built-in 7&#8243; flat screen, cable ready televisions with built-in quality sound systems.</p>
<p>Another important feature of Reebok treadmills is their adjustable impact absorption system. This system provides comfort while reducing the impact to the user&#8217;s joints. This helps users avoid injuries to their ankles, knees, hips, or other joints by reducing the impact typically sustained while walking, jogging, or running.</p>
<p>Reebok treadmills provide consumers with the quality, value, and reliability that has come to be associated with the Reebok name. These treadmills offer consumers first-rate features that can enhance the user&#8217;s fitness routine, thereby increasing their overall health. Consumers are always encouraged to comparison shop before making a purchase. However, consumers should keep in mind that these treadmills are by the Reebok name, and sometimes a name can mean everything.</p>

<p>Are you having trouble with losing <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span>? Well as a personal trainer I am often asked the question of how to <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">lose weight</a></span> off your thighs because this is a very troubled area for women. How ever one of the main problems is that you are not being told the whole truth about losing weight and this is because someone would rather make a quick dollar of you then help you lose weight.</p>
<p>That is why I am here to finally set the record straight so you can really target the fat on your thighs and achieve the overall body shape that you want.</p>
<p><strong>How to lose weight off your thighs</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Well you should already know that you can not burn fat in a single area alone with targeted exercises how ever overall <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight loss</a></span> will lead to thigh fat loss. What you should be doing is thigh exercises like walking lunges, bodyweight squats, power walking, step climbing and skipping. One form of <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> that I do not have my clients doing is jogging because it can actually be counterproductive for weight loss and power walking is a much better choice.</p>
<p>2. If you want to lose the weight off your thighs you are going to have to take <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">diet</a></span> into close consideration. How ever most people cringe when they hear the word diet because they associate it with low amounts of boring food but if you want to lose fat this is not what you want to be doing. I encourage you to start eating 5 to 6 smaller meals a day which will keep your metabolism running high and burning even more calories. Make sure you pick healthy foods like vegetables, lean meats, skim dairy, raw nuts and some fruits.</div>

<p>Since <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight loss</a></span> diets seem to be on lots of people&#8217;s mind, discussing good and bad food for <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> loss is inevitable. You should avoid any food that increases the fat deposits, but you should keep your <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">diet</a></span> flexible rather than restrictive. There is <strong>food that burns body fat</strong>, let&#8217;s see how it works.</p>
<p>Many e-books and e-guides sold as weight loss programs include special chapters about food that burns fat. Scientific studies usually back such content because certain foods have the power to speed up the metabolism and thus improve the fat burning process. Fruit and vegetables make the common food that burns fat by the high content of fibers and cellulose.</p>
<p>Eat apples and you&#8217;ll improve the weight loss speed. They have a high content of a soluble fiber called pectin, not to mention that they also contain lots of anti-oxidants. An apple before each meal and you will efficiently boost your metabolism. Tomatoes and carrots are known to work for weight loss diets. Tomatoes have other <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">health</a></span> benefits too: they regulate high blood pressure and prevent cancer. Carrots on the other hand are a rich source of fibers and have a good content of vitamin A that protects the health of your eyes.</p>
<p>Mangoes and oranges represent other items on the list of food that burns fast. By the high content of vitamin C, these fruits accelerate the elimination of the fat deposits and provide plenty of vitamins to support physical effort when it is the case. There is a much longer list of foods, and you can check lots of variants available online. It would also be useful to learn not only which is the food that burns fast but also which makes you fat.</p>
<p>Consequently, planning, diet and training make up the three-variable formula that guarantees a slimmer body. Limiting your weight loss efforts just to finding the food that burns fast is not enough in terms of efficiency. Victory against obesity requires major lifestyle changes. Do not believe those &#8216;wonder&#8217; <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">fitness</a></span> programs that promise you can eat anything you like and still <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">lose weight</a></span>. There is no absolute weight loss method that will allow you to eat junk food and still lose weight. Get blind to the advertising blah blah and search for the in-depth realities of dietary programs!</p>

<p>Have you been searching for the <strong>top <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">diet</a></span> for fast fat loss</strong>? Well, take 2 quick minutes out of your day to read on and discover an incredible online diet that helped me lose 50 lbs. of fat in 8 weeks&#8230;permanently!</p>
<p>Okay, the first I thing I strongly recommend you do if you want results is to stay away from those &#8220;fad diets&#8221;! The only thing those diets will ever do is cause your metabolism to slow down&#8230;which leads to yo-yo <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight loss</a></span> and they will also cause your body to HOLD ON to fat instead of getting rid of it!</p>
<p>To get fast but permanent results, I highly recommend that you focus more on getting PROPER nutrition and increasing your metabolism to the maximum peak. The top diet for fast fat loss that is based on those key principles is the &#8220;Calorie Shifting Diet&#8221; system.</p>
<p>I was 300 lbs. and had a huge belly when I got started with this diet.</p>
<p>I downloaded the diet generator program that comes with this diet plan and it custom created a menu plan for me containing 4 meals to eat each day. The trick with this dieting system is that the meals are strategically switched around each day to prevent your metabolism from getting accustomed to your eating patterns&#8230;which will cause your fat burning hormones to SKYROCKET to the maximum peak!</p>
<p>Well, the end result was that I lost 50 lbs. of fat in 8 weeks with this diet, and since I was losing <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> 100% naturally, the weight all stayed off permanently!</p>
<p>So, if you are looking for the top diet for fast fat loss, then I highly recommend for you to look into and tryout the calorie shifting diet today.</p>

					<p>Generally newer designs mean better functionality, but when it comes to <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/exercise-bikes/">exercise bikes</a></span>, that isn&#8217;t true. Although the newer mini <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> bicycles and recumbent stationary bikes are assumed to be better by most, that is not in fact true, and the more conventional upright-oriented exercise bicycles still offer more benefits than the aforementioned types. For instance, the fact that <strong>the best upright exercise bikes</strong> most closely resemble conventional bikes, and the amount of space they take up. Another prime benefit is the sound, or the lack thereof offered by most modern upright stationary bikes.</p>
<p>Upright exercise bikes allow a riding experience more similar to a conventional bicycle than any other exercise bicycle. Not only do the handle bars, seat and seating position more so resemble a conventional bike than other exercise bikes, but an upright exercise bicycle also allows you to stand and take on a racing-like mode, not allowed by mini exercise bicycles and recumbent exercise bikes. This is a huge benefit as it allows you to place far more tension on your legs, leading to more development of muscle strength and burning of more calories.</p>
<p>Another feature that is offered by stationary upright bikes as opposed to recumbent exercise bicycles is the amount of space they take up. Upright exercise bikes these days take up very little space and can usually be disassembled for storage. Now although they cannot compete with mini workout bikes in this respect, even the most bottom-range upright <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/exercise-bikes/">exercise bike</a></span> will generally offer far more features than a mini stationary bike. The storage element is key, as for apartment-dwellers and the like, every little bit of space is precious.</p>
<p>Noise is another element in which an upright workout bike will put any other type of exercise bike to shame. The majority of upright exercise bikes use very quiet, yet very efficient magnetic systems, that allow you to watch TV or listen to music or even perhaps read while exercising, without any loud noise distracting you the entire time. Although some do offer air resistance, these are simply for people who prefer the cool breeze and the rustic feel of the fan, however those are rather rare these days.</p>
<p>As visible, not only does an upright exercise bike offer a more realistic feel and take up less space than other stationary bikes, but it&#8217;ll also do it all quietly, allowing you to actually enjoy your workout. This is all in addition to, of course, the general fact that exercise bikes in general allow you to get the full benefits of a bike ride while allowing you to be in control of everything and being in the comfort of your own house. That all said, it&#8217;s easy to see why upright exercise bikes are at least MY choice for exercise.</p>

					<p><span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> training is a type of strength training that provides a great way to get in shape, it can make you stronger, more lean and make you feel better overall. When combined with aerobic <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> and a healthy <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">diet</a></span> you may be surprised at the results you can achieve.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t confuse weight training with bodybuilding or power lifting. Weight training uses the resistance of weights to strengthen your muscles often targeting specific muscle groups; this exercise is meant for anyone who wants to stay in shape. Bodybuilding and power lifting are specific sports that often involve competitions.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing Weight Lifting Equipment</strong></p>
<p>If you want to start weight training at home you will need some weight lifting equipment. But before you go out and invest too much money in a bunch of equipment you may want to try a few different types at your local gym so you get the feel of it and get a better idea of what you may want.</p>
<p>If you are just getting started the main weight lifting equipment you will need will be a weight bench, a set of dumbbells and maybe an exercise mat. Depending on your specific needs and goals you may need additional pieces of weight lifting equipment, but these will give you a great start because of the versatility of exercises you can preform with just these items. With these things you can work out your arms, legs, back, shoulders, chest and abs.</p>
<p>Adjustable Dumbbells<br />
If you are short of space or if you want a set of dumbbells that is more versatile you may want to consider getting adjustable dumbbells. Adjustable dumbbells are great because in what looks like a single pair of dumbbells you get a a full set with a range of weights. You simply adjust the setting on the dumbbells and adjust the weight depending on the exercise you are preforming and depending on your progress. They are also great for households with multiple users because they are so easy to adjust.</p>
<p>Weight training is great for your overall <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">health</a></span> from you muscles to your bones and all you need is a few pieces of weight lifting equipment to get started.</p>

					<p>Schwinn recumbent bikes let riders <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">exercise</a></span> in comfort. Isn&#8217;t that one of the main reasons to choose a recumbent bike, the comfort? But why choose the Schwinn bikes? Here are what they offer&#8230;</p>
<p>1. Easy seating.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the most frequent positive comments from owners. Owners like the seat and the seating position too. It works for just about any body of any size. That&#8217;s a big deal because the more comfortable the ride, the longer you&#8217;ll ride. More time in the seat means more fat burned and better condition for you&#8230;</p>
<p>2. Stable ride.</p>
<p>Rocking and rolling might be OK sometimes, but not on <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/exercise-bikes/">exercise bikes</a></span>. The Schwinns, especially the Schwinn 230 and the Schwinn 231, are stable platforms made for serious riding. These bikes are not as heavy as many, but they are heavy enough for hard use.</p>
<p>3. Easy to move.</p>
<p>Recumbents take up more room than upright exercise bikes. That means they often get moved in and out as they get used. These bikes are made to be moved. The <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/weight-loss-tips/">weight</a></span> is heavy enough for stability, but not so heavy they become monuments.</p>
<p>4. Quiet.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the drive is magnetic. No clanking chains, no fans, just whisper quiet magnetic drive that&#8217;s tied to a computer control. The two main models of Schwinn&#8217;s better recumbents, the 230 and 231, share the same drive with different computer programming power.</p>
<p>5. Fights boredom.</p>
<p>Boredom stops many an <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/exercise-bikes/">exercise bike</a></span> rider. Steady pedaling over long time leads to total boredom. It doesn&#8217;t have to be though. Computer programming builds in lots of workout routines. The computer in connection with the quiet drive simulates a wide variety of road workouts. Variety fights boredom and the bike computer provides the variety.</p>
<p>Schwinn recumbent bikes provide lots of value in mid-priced machines. Not the cheapest or most expensive bikes, these are high quality with lots of powerful electronics. Burn fat in comfort and fight boredom while you ride&#8230;</p>

					<p>Used <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/treadmills/">treadmills</a></span> are an option in this difficult economy that you can save money and still get a great workout.</p>
<p>Commercial grade treadmills that have been previously used is the answer for your <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/home-gyms/">home gym</a></span> needs.</p>
<p>If you are looking to add to your professional gym or have a rehabilitation center then purchasing used gym equipment like used treadmills and used <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/elliptical-trainers/">ellipticals</a></span> are a great option. Rather than forking out often times as much as double or triple the price you can pocket the difference or buy more <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/">fitness equipment</a></span>.</p>
<p>Looking on websites such as Craigslist and backpack are options but make sure that you aren&#8217;t buying a lemon.</p>
<p>You need to ask a few questions such as:</p>
<p>How old is the machine?</p>
<p>What is the reason you are selling?</p>
<p>Was the <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/index.php/category/health-fitness-articles/">fitness</a></span> equipment every serviced? if so how often?</p>
<p>Where did you buy the <span class='bm_keywordlink'><a href="http://www.fitnessequipmentbuffs.com/">exercise equipment</a></span>? (From someone else, a company or big box store etc.)</p>
<p>Besides asking a few of these questions another place you can find used ellipticals would be eBay, your local newspaper and doing a search online for used gym equipment.</p>
<p>If you are going to buy used ellipticals from used gym equipment company&#8217;s that specialize in used fitness equipment look for companies that have been around for at least 5 years.</p>
<p>You want to also make sure they have a warehouse that is over 15,000 square feet to ensure they have a large supply of gym equipment.</p>
<p>Also call their customer service department and talk to them to ensure they are knowledgeable in their field.</p>
<p>To find the top company I have reviewed that specializing not only in used ellipticals but all used gym equipment check out my website below.</p>
