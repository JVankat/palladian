				</div></div></div></div><div class="modfloat full"><div id="mod_2658136" class="module moduleText color0"><div style="word-wrap:break-word" class="txtd" id="txtd_2658136"><h3>Snakes</h3><p>In Thailand, these are always scary and often dangerous.<br /><br />If there is grass or undergrowth, there is a chance there are snakes, even in city parks or hotel gardens. The good news is most will run (or slither) away if they see you coming. The bad news comes if you stand on one. Beating the grass with a stick might look silly, but if you have to cross open country it’s not a bad idea for your personal safety.<br /><br />Spitting Cobras are capable of spraying venom into a persons' eyes from three metres, so if you see a snake, give it a wide berth. Trying to kill a snake is an especially dangerous activity. The genuinely dangerous varieties-  especially cobras and pit vipers- will not try to escape, they will attack.<br /><br />If the worst comes to the worst and you are bitten, don’t worry about identifying the snake, go straight to a hospital. Thailand has an excellent health system that is well used to snake bites. If you you receive care within an hour or two you should be fine. Roughly 7000 snake bites occur every year (rather less than occur in the US) but there are only thirty or so deaths. In Thailand, <em>travel insurance is recommended</em> since treatment can be costly- around 200 dollars a night, depending on location.</p>
<h2></h2><h3>First Aid for Venomous Snake Bites</h3>
<p><br /><strong>First aid for snake bites </strong>involves washing the wound with soap and water, immobilising the bitten area and keeping the wound lower than the heart. If a hospital is more than half an hour away a bandage can be used a few inches above the wound to reduce the spread of venom. The bandage should be loose enough to work a finger beneath or restriction of blood flow can cause injury.<br /><br />Some grisly photos can be found buried away in this pdf: <a href="http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/jitmm2008/download/13102008-jitmm-c11-suteparuk-snake-bites.pdf"><u>snake bite photos pdf</u></a></p></div></div><div id="mod_new8" class="module moduleAdSpot color0">

Like a lot of insects in the tropics, if it rains heavily, giant centipedes like to come indoors to avoid drowning. A shoe or bag can provide a handy place for the creatures to hide and if they are surprised and can't escape they will bite.</p>
<p>Their bite does not kill but for three or four days the victim will be in serious pain- even a shot of morphine from the local hospital will only take the edge off. <br /><br />The bite marks are similar to those of a small snake and centipede bites can be mistaken for snake bites in the dark. The victim requires anti-tetanus, painkillers and rest. In the case of allergic reaction, breathing support may be necessary,</p>
<p>They are plenty big enough to notice in the day but for your own safety never walk around without shoes in the dark, even indoors! </p></div></div></div><div class="floatclear"></div><div class="modfloat right"><div id="mod_2658148" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_2658148">				<div id="img_url_985533">

<p><br />Sharks are not a problem in Thai waters, so jellyfish are the most dangerous animal you are likely to encounter while swimming. They can cause a lot of pain and leave injuries that take weeks to heal. In extreme cases, ugly scars remain.<br /><br />Avoid swimming during overcast periods or after storms. Strong sun is dangerous to jellyfish and they won’t come close to shore in good weather,. If stung, remove any jelly from the skin carefully and bathe with vinegar if available. Freshwater will make the pain worse.<br /><br />If stings cover a large area of your body or the pain is severe, a trip to hospital is worthwhile. A single fatality was reported recently in Phuket.</p>
<h3>Coral</h3>
<p>Dead coral can be razor sharp and cause nasty cuts. Living coral can cause stings similar to jellyfish. Divers and snorkelers should be aware. </p></div></div></div><div class="floatclear"></div><div class="modfloat right"><div id="mod_2658149" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_2658149">				<div id="img_url_985538">

<p>Mosquitoes avoid sunlight and are mostly a problem at night. Even so, during daylight hours they can be about their business in shady places- under trees, under restaurant tables and in poorly lit interiors. Covering up at night with long sleeves and trousers is a good option but be aware that the larger varieties can pierce cotton to reach a meal.</p>
<p>Most bites will only cause minor irritation but If you are allergic to them, the reaction can lead to large maddening swellings that take days to subside.</p>
<p>Most local pharmacies have English speakers who can recommend a range of preparations to reduce the annoyance.'Tiger Balm' ointment contains a natural anaesthetic and is a favorite with Thais. 'Clobet cream' is a widely available anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, cortisone cream. <br /><br />Whilst modern buildings are generally well screened from mosquitoes, picturesque beach cottages made from bamboo often are not. If a mosquito net is provided for sleeping, it really is a good idea to use it. Outdoors, insect repellents based on DEET offer genuinely effective protection. The first evening that you forget, you will realise just how effective! <br /></p></div></div><div id="mod_2659636" class="module moduleVideo"><div id="video_117503"></div><script type="text/javascript">insertVideo('YouTube', 'kTxRFB2VP_w', 'videoYouTubeBig', '', 'video_117503', '');</script></div><div id="mod_2658140" class="module moduleText color0"><div style="word-wrap:break-word" class="txtd" id="txtd_2658140"><h3>Thailand Scorpions</h3><p>These can the size of your hand and they are surprisingly quick. Strangely, the smaller they are the more painful the sting since the poison in their bulbous tails is usually more concentrated. The legend is they are attracted by the smell of stale beer so get rid of empty bottles swiftly.<br /><br />Black Scorpions, the most common variety in Thailand, very rarely deliver a fatal sting and aren't thought of as a serious health risk. In fact, compared to their lethal cousins in Mexico and the Middle East the sting is said to be mild.<br /><br />Prompt hospital treatment is recommended, however, as some people suffer severe allergic reactions. In a recent case, a Welsh man died in his home country many weeks after being stung in Thailand. <br /><br />Treatment consists of anti-venom administration, support for breathing if necessary, antibiotics and anti-tetanus injections. Application of ice packs can reduce pain.<br /></p></div></div></div><div class="floatclear"></div><div class="modfloat right"><div id="mod_2658159" class="module moduleAmazon color0"><h2

This still means thousands of bites every year.</p> 
<p>Luckily, deaths from spider bites are very rare- less than 3 per year across the whole world and these are generally a result of allergic reactions.</p> 
<p>The most <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/The-Glade">dangerous spiders</a> in Thailand are mainly forest dwellers. Some Tarantula species have a reputation for aggression and the bites are painful and best treated in hospital with anti-venom. Symptoms can include swelling, exhaustion, muscle cramping, difficulty breathing and fever. Sometimes, these occur days after the bite.</p> 
<p>For your safety, empty out shoes and shake clothes before wearing, especially in rural areas!</p> <p /></div></div></div><div class="floatclear"></div><div class="modfloat right"><div id="mod_2658151" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_2658151">				<div id="img_url_985543">

They do not run away if they chance on you. They attack! The larger varieties usually rely on brute strength to vanquish their insect enemies. These will only give you a nip with their powerful jaws. The smaller ones- and some are so small they are barely visible- have all sorts of poisons and allergens to inject into your skin. After a day or so, the worst bites can feel as if someone is slowly driving a spear through your body. Watch out for ants at all times! </p>
<p>The best defense is hygiene: any food residues in a house or hotel will quickly attract columns of ants, as will food stains on clothes. Cortisone creams will reduce inflammation and pain effectively if you are bitten. Local remedies like Tiger Balm are less effective.</p></div></div></div><div class="floatclear"></div><div class="modfloat right"><div id="mod_2658153" class="module moduleImage"><div id="imgs_2658153">				<div id="img_url_985544">

The spines are actively used to inject toxins into any living thing that approaches too closely. In human beings, the result is acute pain with the possibilty of breathing problems and vomiting. Hospital treatment is strongly recommended although the poisen is almost never lethal.<br /><br />It is very rarely found near sandy beaches so is not dangerous to swimmers.

Eradication programs are out of the question because of the Buddhist respect for life. Sterilisation programs have proved ineffective.</p>  <p>Stray dogs in Thailand are generally docile but they can be intimidating in large packs at night and some will bite if they feel threatened.</p>  <p>One of the best ways of dealing with aggressive dogs is to back away whilst maintaining eye contact and being willing to defend yourself. Thais will not hesitate to a use a stick or stone in self defense, neither should you. </p>  <p>If you are bitten, it is essential to get treatment immediately because of the widespread problem of rabies in Thailand.

<p>Like monkeys anywhere, these creatures will steal anything, especially if it is edible. They can unzip bags and tear through the contents. They can rip mirrors from cars and motor cycles. They may even try to bully you out of a snack. This can be scary for children and sometimes a threat to their safety. Stand up to them-use sticks and stones if you have to- and they back off.</p>

In water, they actively swim towards any disturbance. On land, if they detect the presence of a human being or an animal they stand up and wave from side to side in a searching motion. If they find contact with skin, they quickly attach themselves with their lower sucker and the head probes the skin for a good place to penetrate. Minute, razor sharp teeth slice an opening and the head enters. They gorge themselves on up to seven times their own body weight in blood before dropping off. An anti-coagulant is used to keep the blood flowing during feeding and the wound may bleed for several hours afterwards. 
<p><strong>Leeches pose the greatest threat to health in Thailand during flooding in towns and cities</strong>. The flood water brings sewage to the surface from drains. Leeches swept in from country areas cause wounds which become infected. During a series of recent floods across Thailand, many thousands of people became ill in this way. The government recommended wearing jeans and tying plastic bags around the feet to keep the leeches at bay- a low tech solution that would probably help.</p></div></div><div id="mod_3174809" class="module moduleLink color1"><h2 class="subtitle">Thailand Crime</h2><ul><li><a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Thailand-Health--Safety-and-Risks-2-Crime">Even in beautiful Thailand there are bad guys...</a><br /></li></ul></div><div id="mod_2658158" class="module moduleLink color1"><h2 class="subtitle">Government Travel Advice</h2><ul><li><a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1040.html">http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1040.html</a><br />Thailand Specific Information from the US State Department</li><li><a href="http://www.voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/report_rapport-eng.asp?id=290000">http://www.voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/report_rapport-eng.asp?id=290000</a><br />Canadian Government Travel Advice for Thailand</li><li><a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/travel-advice-by-country/asia-oceania/thailand">Thailand travel advice</a><br />Latest travel and safety info for Thailand from the British Foreign Office</li><li><a href="http://www.smarttraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/Thailand">Travel Advice for Thailand - Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a><br /></li></ul></div><div id="mod_11308038" class="module moduleNews color1"><h2 class="subtitle">Thailand: Dangerous Animals in the News</h2><ul class="news_list"><li><a href="http://lrd.yahooapis.com/_ylc=X3oDMTVnYjIzc3I3BF9TAzIwMjMxNTI3MDIEYXBwaWQDdUJyRWpVTFYzNEY1UWxZMVNmMV9WTW1BaEN3ZW9EeE01SEVoQzRab1NpdlJxQ1R6S2JLLnVlZGo5RlVqQXQxMHNHVk9XZy0tBGNsaWVudANib3NzBHNlcnZpY2UDQk9TUwRzbGsDdGl0bGUEc3JjcHZpZANpT0QwSjBnZUF1MVo5TkhqSzA4ZUlJeENRdE50QzAwakNJa0FCLnp6/SIG=138roa6pc/**http%3A//www.businessweek.com/news/2011-01-03/thailand-s-inflation-quickens-adding-rate-pressure.html" rel="nofollow">Thailand’s Inflation Quickens, Adding Rate Pressure</a><span class="source">BusinessWeek</span><small class="special">46 minutes ago</small><p style="padding:0.2em 0 0.5em 0">Thai inflation accelerated in December for the first time in five months, adding to the case for the central bank to raise borrowing costs further.</p></li>

Most people who only visit Thailand for a few weeks a year will never meet anything worse than a mosquitoe. Long term residents need to be a bit more careful.

Luckily. they are too big to get into your ears and don't lay eggs anywhere in your body!</p><p>On the other hand, there are common kinds of millipede that will lay eggs in any wounds that you have. The result is a large painfull swelling that needs to be cut open in a hospital so the millipedes feeding on your flesh can be removed.</p><p>There is also a (not common) kind of leech that will make its home in your ear and suck your blood causing a lot of pain.I will get some photos of these creatures and include them in the entries above.</p><p>As for mosquito repellants, I've never bought a repellent from a pharmacy and found that it doesn't work well.

The real tourist season starts in November when the Winter Monsoon is past and there is almost no rain until March or later.</p><p>Don't let me put you off, though. It doesn't rain every day and when it does rain it is usually for a few predictable hours a day- often late afternoon. One advantage of rain in Thailand is that it makes for pleasantly cool (but never cold) evenings. You will also see the flowers and trees at their beautiful best.</p><p>As for dangers- Krabi is a peaceful town and people are extremely friendly. The whole Thai tourist industry is amazingly efficient and people do what they say will do, whether it is buses, taxis or hotels.</p><p>Watch where you put your feet if you are anywhere but the beach or the street and your will avoid anything that might bite you.

Jellyfish in the bed are certainly unwanted visitors, their tenticle hugs are far to stingy!! As for the wildlife, its good to know what is around, even if you may not see it. I'm guessing the more inland you go on the Island the more likely it would be to see some of these creatures as it is more jungle in its habitat. Most likely to encounter will probably be the ants, scorpions and centipedes, plus the obligatory mosquitoes!

Also Koh Samui has to one of the best places for a honey moon on the planet- so good choice as well</p><p>In terms of things to look out for- the greatest risk to tourists always comes from hiring a motorcycle. They are a great and inexpensive way to get about and no one will ask you for a license. At the same time, driving standards in Thailand are not high and you will see a lot of holiday makers with cuts, scrapes and worse because</p><p>a They didn't really know how to drive a motorcycle</p><p>b They didn't understand the eccentric and unpredictable way Thai people often drive</p><p>c They drove after a few drinks!</p><p>The island also has a reputation for bag snatching gangs so bags are not recommended for important items like passports or money.</p><p>Don't let this put you off though, Thai people are very friendly and the tourist industry is very efficient and well organised. Most people who come will come again.</p><p>Food-</p><p>Except in the cheapest restaurants, you will have English menus. The food is some of the best in the world but can be very hot (spicy) so if you aren't used to it, it is never a bad idea to ask: hot or no hot? Most foreigners (foreigners are called pharang by Thais) ask for no hot (mai phet).</p><p>If you like sea food Koh Samui is is an especially good destination- I would recommended the crab curry- it is the kind of food that turns you into a cave man. Nobody will never be allowed to take that crab away from you!</p><p>As to the weather- you are going to be there in the rainy season so on some days you will have a tropical downpour for an hour or two. It might be worth bringing a quality umbrella. Umbrellas you buy here fall apart very quickly. Clothes you don't need too many of. There are plenty of bargains to fill up your cases with for the return journey.</p><p>I would check out Lonely Planet for a fuller guide:</p><p><a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/ko-samui" rel="nofollow">http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/ko-samui</a></p><p>Enjoy your stay!</p></div><div class="comment" id="comment4165376"><p class="comment_meta"><strong>seghillsteve7&nbsp;</strong>2 months ago </p><p>Many thanks, really appreciate your comments.
