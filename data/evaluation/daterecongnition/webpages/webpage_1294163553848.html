<br />
That would depend on the voltage..!<br />
<br />
Divide the wattage by the voltage for current.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">laidback</div><div class="date">09-25-2006, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So a &quot;300 watt&quot; par lamp really has a power draw of 300 watts and is not some obscure reference to some arcane light output equivalency number or anything like that?<br />
<br />
And yeah, to arrive at 2.5 amps I was figuring 120 volts.  I usually see about 121 or 122 around here.<br />
<br />
I guess that means I can't relamp my front hang with 500 watt bubs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your formula is correct for american voltage.<br />
<br />
For quick calculations it is easy to figure 100w = 1 amp (it builds in a safty margin.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will try and draw 300 watts. The I calculation works for all situations where you have the voltage and the consumption (wattage) values. It's well worth remembering...!<br />

<br />
The voltage at the fixture will be different than the wall voltage - there is a drop with longer cords - especially the small diameter most often seen.<br />
<br />
Low voltage will change the amp draw - lights will dim, computers might glitch, amps will clip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Papa C</div><div class="date">10-13-2006, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey laidback,<br />
Getting to your original question.<br />
Yes.<br />
Plus as others have stated, all the resistance of the various cables, and equipment are considered when plugging those 300 watt lamps into a wall outlet.<br />
<br />
Conservablly speaking,<br />
6 - 300 watt lamps equals 15 amps. (the max for most wall outlets)<br />
Add to that PA - Guitar amps - Keyboard amps - Bass amps - and all the rest of the electronics needed to run a performance. and you get anywhere from a total need of at lest 25 -30 additional Amperes. <br />
So... it you are fortunate enough to find 3 separate 15 amp circuits the band and 6 light fixtures may work OK.<br />
Please don't forget also as wire heats up the resistance also rises causing an increase in the amount of current being drawn.<br />
That's why some times when you first plug things in they work and in the middle of the 3rd song of the set, all goes silent on that circuit.<br />
Hey hope this helps <br />
Thanks for your time in reading it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This depends on the mains voltage. This calculation is based on around a 110vac whereas most of the globe operates on a higher voltage (ie. 220-250 vac).<br />
<br />
It's easier to remember the voltage, consumption calculation as it works with any voltage..<br />

<br />
Lighting draws a lot more current than P.A. and amps. I need to have a seperate circuit to run the lighting or the breakers will go.<br />
<br />
I have been good with two sperate 20 amp circuits on for the band the other for the lights for many many gigs.<br />

<br />
He told me to just divide the total watts by the voltage to get amp draw.  He also said that the length of the power cord supplying the lights/dimmers should only have a negligible effect unless you go over 150' or so.  Some buildings have breakers that trip at their rating (meaning a 20 amp breaker will blow at 20 amps) but a lot of them are designed to trip at 80% of their rating (which is the correct design).  <br />
<br />
But here's the weird thing:  My light rig is a bit over the top.  Total wattage of all the lights (without taking into consideration fans and such) is well over 5000 watts.  I've been plugging into whatever is available and crossing my fingers, but I wanted to due the math (and verify it) to try to plan ahead more - hence my talking to the electrician.  I did a show last week where all I had was one circuit available.  Ran the show (also with a 1000W fogger) with no problems.  Now, admittedly, it is very rare for all the lights to be on full blast at the same moment, but IT DOES occur from time to time during the course of a show.  It was after the show that I found out that I was running off a single 20amp breaker!!!  In theory, I figure my rig was at times drawing over 44 amps. <br />
<br />
So, why didn't I blow anything?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Breakers, like fuses, have a time factor as well as a current factor. I can't imagine how you got away with 45amps down a 20amp breaker though..<br />
<br />
I used to work in a repair shop for a lighting company in the Uk for a few years. When I used to repair the Terra strobes (crap strobes), you could gear the breakers clicking in time with the flash as they were trying to break but the strobe was on and off so quickly, they never did.. You could adjust the tempo of the breakers clicks by the tempo of the strobe..  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kevinnem</div><div class="date">12-06-2006, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">when you say that all the lights where on, ... do you mean just for a flash? or they stayed on?<br />
<br />
I would think with that amount of power, it would blow real fast.<br />
<br />
where you at 110 or 220?<br />
maybe some bad wireing? someone tied it in to a 50 amp, or if they are a real idiot even direct to distro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dravenzouk</div><div class="date">12-06-2006, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Running a normal 120 (110) system.  I didn't see any way someone tied to a 50amp or anything, but I'm not absolutely sure.  <br />
<br />
By &quot;full on&quot; I mean that all the lights were on for a few seconds at a time.  Right near the end of the night.  The strobes of course were strobing so those weren't &quot;full on&quot; - they account for about 600 watts and were flashing moderately fast. <br />
<br />
Like Rimmer says, &quot;I can't imagine how I got away with it...&quot; but nothing blew.  It's a mystery to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dravenzouk</div><div class="date">12-06-2006, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so now the plot thickens.  I decided to try a test - I plugged in everything I've got (light-wise) into a single outlet.  I figured I would turn on each group of fixtures one at a time to see the point that the breaker tripped.<br />
<br />
Here are the particulars:<br />
- All powered by a single wall socket, standard US three prong grounded, run off a single 20amp breaker in the box, 120V.<br />
<br />
- That socket feeds two power strip/conditioners/surge protectors that are rated at 15amp/125V each.<br />
<br />
From there all the light fixtures and dimmer packs are plugged in. They are as follows: <br />
32 - Par38 cans with 150w bulbs in each.<br />
8 - Pinspots with 30w bulbs in each.<br />
4 - 75w strobes run off a Chauvet strobe controller rated at 3w<br />
2 - Omega 250C color changers with 250w bulbs in each<br />
4 - AmDJ Color150 color changers with 150w bulbs in each.<br />
2 - Colorsplash196 LED Pars at 20w each.<br />
- All the P38's and pinspots are evenly distributed into 8 dimmer packs, each with an output rating of 10amp/channel, 20amp/max at 110V.<br />
- There are fuses and circuit breakers all over the place here - in the dimmer packs, the power strips, the color changers, the LED's, etc. - pretty much everywhere but the P38's.<br />
<br />
So, I held my breath and started fading everything up one by one.  I was surprised to find that everything held, no problem.  Once I had EVERYTHING on at full blast I decided to leave them up to see what happened - nothing.  2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes - no problem.  All the fuses, breakers, and most importantly the 20amp breaker in the building held.  <br />
<br />
I'm scratching my head - what's going on here?  What am I missing?  By my calculations I was running at 6483 watts which means 54amps!!   Into a single wall plug on a 20amp breaker.  Is my math faulty?  WTD?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you quoted lamp wattage is correct, then there must be a fault with the breaker.. No breaker should hold with that amount of current running through it..<br />
<br />
The first thing I would check is that the wattage of your Par38's in fact 150 watt, although I think I have only seen 150watts (and maybe 120watts..) versions.<br />
<br />
The best way to find out how much current your are using whilst the gig is in progress is with a clamp meter.. You can get AC or DC (or both) stand alone clamp meters although if you already have a decent multimeter, you can buy a clamp meter attachment. Basically you clamp the live wire, ideally near the breaker and it will show how much current is passing through the live. You can't clamp the L+N+Earth though. Only the live. I use clamp meters for testing the phase balance when using three phase (which I use quite a lot).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeromus-X</div><div class="date">12-07-2006, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep going with that test and there's a good chance you're going to be dealing with a pretty significant fire.  If the breaker's not stopping it, and your math is correct, that means you're running 54 amps through a wire made to handle twenty (or less -- if this was your house, probably 15 amps!).  The breaker tripping is designed to prevent anything from just melting right down, and it sounds like you're dangerously close to having a pile of goo in your walls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dravenzouk</div><div class="date">12-07-2006, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this whole thing scares me a bit.  Phrases like &quot;dealing with a pretty significant fire&quot;, and &quot;dangerously close to having a pile of goo&quot; seem to resonate a fair bit. <br />
<br />
The thing is, I've never tripped a breaker with this setup, and I've used it in quite a number of different situations - scummy clubs, arts centers, VFW halls, performance spaces, etc.  Most of the time I just plug in to whatever happens to be available.  I try always to get a dedicated circuit with at least two 20-30 breakers but as I'm sure you know, sometimes you take what you get.  I've had to plug into to a single line or share with other equipment many times.  Of course, it's only on rare instances that all the fixtures are on full blast (and it's always been momentary until I tried this test).  <br />
<br />
I always found it curious that I've run trouble free, which is why I decided to do the math, talk to an electrician, and do this test.  Now I'm even more puzzled.  &quot;A little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing&quot; - yeah, I hear that.  <br />
<br />
I'm going to try getting my hands on a clamp meter (per Rimmer) and do some more investigation.  I really don't feel like pushing my luck and doing any repeat push-it-til-it-blows tests - the first one was a bit nerve racking.<br />
<br />
I keep thinking that my math/calculations are off somewhere.  Can any of you check my numbers and see what you come up with?  (and as far as those P-38's go, they all have 150watt BR-38 120volt flood bulbs in them.).  Thanks, d.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your calculations are pretty good..<br />
<br />
<br />
Do the clamp meter thing. Generally I get to use distribution boards that have circuitry that meters voltage of each phase, Hz and current. The clamp meter is absolutely the way to go in your situation as there will be no doubt as to how much current is going through the live/s before the breaker..<br />
<br />
Breakers go as their coils heat up. When they fail, they usually don't work any more.. They wont stay in the on position. Although I am not an electrician, I am a technical dude and work on many professional shows. I am totally used to all this stuff and would say, without question.. there is a problem with a 20 amp breaker being happy about passing much more than that in current.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dravenzouk</div><div class="date">12-16-2006, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I've been testing everything with the clamp meter, and yes my caculations were correct.  The whole system draws in the neighborhood of 54 amps (with &quot;everything on&quot;).  <br />
<br />
I checked amp draw during all my individual scenes.  Turns out the vast majority of the time I'm drawing between 18-21 amps.  A few scenes are well below that, and about 10% of the time I'm drawing 22-25 amps.  One big scene draws the max at 42 amps.  <br />
<br />
The mystery still is that I've now checked the system at multiple places and have yet to trip a breaker.  I've set up into two 20A breakers, two 30A breakers, one 30A breaker, and (ouch) one 20A breaker.  I've tried the &quot;everything on&quot; situation in each place (albeit very briefly).  Is it possible that ALL these places had faulty breakers?  <br />
<br />
The other question is what do I do now - to MAKE SURE everything is above board for the future.  I see alot of talk about distros but that seems a little over the top.   I don't want to have to use an electrician at every hookup, and lots of folks seem to think it's not a good idea to &quot;do-it-yourself&quot;.    Is there a safe, user-friendly, setup that would work for me?  Can I get a crash course in distro wiring from an electrician and then do it myself from then on?<br />
<br />
For the time being I've decided to rework all my individual scenes and make sure none of them draws more than 22amps.   I'll keep the &quot;big ones&quot; in reserve and only use them when I've got two 30A circuits available.  This is kind of a pain, and requires hassles and compromises, but it's better than tripping breakers in the middle of a show (or worse).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I do want to expand my rig somewhat in the future.  Nothing terribly huge, but maybe adding another 1500 watts of lights or so.   Also, of course every venue is different, but seems like most of the time I have access to either one or two 20A-30A circuits at best.  And I have yet to work a club where someone there knows ANYTHING at all about their own setup.<br />
<br />
I want lots of flashy lights, but no unintentional fires or explosions.</div></div><hr />

okay so you have normal 120 volt power, .. this is what runs your mirco wave, and blender. a plug will give you 15 amps., maybe 20. Next step up is 240volt it is more volt, and can deliver more current as the wires used are larger... this is what is used for electric stoves and electric dryers. some very large power tools use this as well. they use HUGE plugs. you can et 50 amp PER LEG, and there are 2 legs. you would have a power distro, where you plug in to teh 240/50amp and then get a bunch of 15 amp 110 volt out of it.<br />
<br />
3 phase is the nest step up, and has 3 hot wires, a nuetral and a ground. there is 120 volt from EACH hot to the nuetral wire, and 208 volt = 1/sin(120degreesphase angle)*240 volt <br />
this <br />
<br />
each leg can carry a lot of current, I think in some cases up wards of 600 amp. and that is for 3 legs!<br />
<br />
<br />
however the long and short of it is , if you don't know what 3 phase is don't use it.<br />

Not generally the case. The size of the core determines the amount of current that can be carried..<br />
<br />
Here in the Uk, we use much smaller cable for the same current draw due to the higher voltage (pressure). The same size cable can power more than twice the lighting (consumption wise) than in the US. More pressure, less current. Smaller cable than in the US for the same job basically<br />
<br />
dravenzouk The reason I asked about three phase is that it could have been a 20amp three phase (or four pole) breaker which gives you 60amps through the breaker on three different live phases (basically, in your case.. 120vac times three). Obviously not the case though.. But worth an ask..<br />
<br />
Any chance you can take a picture of the breaker in question? I'd like to see the ratings just in case there are any clues<br />
<br />

Exactly, gauge of cable determins the current carrying capacity of the cable, as I said, the larger cables allow you to use more current.<br />

I think you would use the *same* size wire in the UK for the same current. you use higher voltage, so you can get more power out of that same amount of current. But I _don't_ think it is right to say that you &quot;can use much smaller cable for the same current draw&quot;, cause the voltage is higher.<br />
<br />
<br />
how ever the rest of the paragragh is right. - given the same power consuption, at 2 voltages , the one with the higer voltage will result in less current and in that case you could use smaller wire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Consumption is the key here.. If you have a 1000watt potential demand, then it will draw current based on it's voltage. If you feed a filament lamp with 240volts, it will draw 4.5amps (approx). If it's a 110volt filament, it will draw just over 9amps (approx) which requires a larger core cable. That was my point.<br />
<br />
I only mentioned it as you said (whether you meant it this way or not..) <br />
<br />
<br />
Next step up is 240volt it is more volt, and can deliver more current as the wires used are larger... <br />
<br />
which sort of suggested that you need larger wires because the voltage is higher.<br />

Interestingly, I just got finished talking with an electrician about this very issue, and then opened up the forum and found this thread at the top of the page.<br />
<br />
He told me to just divide the total watts by the voltage to get amp draw.  He also said that the length of the power cord supplying the lights/dimmers should only have a negligible effect unless you go over 150' or so.  Some buildings have breakers that trip at their rating (meaning a 20 amp breaker will blow at 20 amps) but a lot of them are designed to trip at 80% of their rating (which is the correct design).  <br />
<br />
But here's the weird thing:  My light rig is a bit over the top.  Total wattage of all the lights (without taking into consideration fans and such) is well over 5000 watts.  I've been plugging into whatever is available and crossing my fingers, but I wanted to due the math (and verify it) to try to plan ahead more - hence my talking to the electrician.  I did a show last week where all I had was one circuit available.  Ran the show (also with a 1000W fogger) with no problems.  Now, admittedly, it is very rare for all the lights to be on full blast at the same moment, but IT DOES occur from time to time during the course of a show.  It was after the show that I found out that I was running off a single 20amp breaker!!!  In theory, I figure my rig was at times drawing over 44 amps. <br />
<br />
So, why didn't I blow anything?  <br />
<br />
What BRAND of breakers are backing your circuits? From my experience (licenced electrician with 6+ years experience) certain brands are crap and will not trip until there is WAY more amperage than they are rated for.<br />
<br />
See if your electrician can build you something that puts an actual Edison Fuse (old-style fuse which is way more relyable than a modern breaker) of the same amperage as your breaker, in series between your light rig and your breaker. I'll bet you'll blow that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
sum it up with these point (everyone else please add some too.<br />
<br />
<br />
voltage is either 120/240 or, 3 phase at 208.<br />
Given a power level (say 10,000 watts) the amprage will be lower if your working at higher voltage then it will if you are working with lower voltages (V=IR)(VI=P)<br />
<br />
the size of the cable, and maybe the distro plannel will dictate how much current you can safely use.</div></div><hr />

Just to add. At 240vac, measuring across two of the three phases give you around 420 volts.<br />

cool, I assume this is a europe thing? in north Am. we use the ones alrealy mentioned. I have never seen or used anything above 250volt. Is this faily common in this area of the world ( I know your standard wall outlet is 240)?</div></div><hr />

A few thoughts:  <br />
Do the 4 75 watt strobes draw power all the time or only when they'fire?  If only when they fire &amp; they're not firing all at the same time then your draw would actually be slightly less.  I can't imaging it would be enough less not to trip the breaker, but maybe.<br />
<br />
I've started getting involved with low voltage landscape lighting &amp; I've found this to be helpful when explaining to bubba the sprinkler guy why he has to buy 'bigger wire for smaller volts&quot;</div></div><hr />

Good point about the strobes. They should only draw when they fire. <br />
<br />
As to &quot;bigger wire for smaller volts&quot;, thats because (as stated) amperage determines wire size. With low voltage wiring, wattage stays relatively constant. Voltage drops but amperage increases proportionaly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... you're listing 32 par 38 cans.<br />
<br />
Are you turning on ALL of them, or are the 8 banks of 4 lights each, chasing on the dimmer packs?<br />
<br />
If that's the case, the chase controllers would only allow 8 lights to be pulling a load at a time... not 32.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a 240vac mains thing. 3 phase is 415 to 420 (ish) measured across any two of the three phases. Each phase to neutral measurement is anything from 220-250vac. This does vary though. I have seen over 260vac in some venues, which is bad for many generic or electronic fixtures.<br />
<br />
The low voltage lighting you mention though, only requires suitably large cabling from the lamp to the transformer, which would naturally be quite close, due to voltage drop on low voltage cabling. The feed from the mains supply to the transformer would be rated by the wattage of the lamps.<br />
<br />
Cya.. ;)<br />
