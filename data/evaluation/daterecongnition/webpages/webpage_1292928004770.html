<br>BBC reporting
<p>Vulnerable children in some of New York's poorest districts are being
forced to take part in HIV drug trials. During a nine month investigation,
the BBC has uncovered the disturbing truth about the way authorities in
New York City are conducting the fight against Aids.&nbsp; HIV positive
children - some only a few months old - are enrolled in toxic experiments
without the consent of guardians or relatives. In some cases where parents
have refused to give children their medication, they have been placed in
care.&nbsp;
<p>HIV positive children and their loved ones have few rights if they choose
to battle with social work authorities in New York City. Jacklyn Hoerger's
job was to treat children with HIV at a New York children's home.&nbsp;
But nobody had told her that the drugs she was administering were experimental
and highly toxic. "We were told that if they were vomiting, if they lost
their ability to walk, if they were having diarrhoea, if they were dying,
then all of this was because of their HIV infection." In fact it was the
drugs that were making the children ill and the children had been enrolled
on the secret trials without their relatives' or guardians' knowledge.
As Jacklyn would later discover, those who tried to take the children off
the drugs risked losing them into care.&nbsp; The BBC asked the Alliance
for Human Research Protection about their view on the drug trials. `</dl>

<br>Doctors say quick screening now used is too often wrong, may do more
harm than good
<p>"...health professionals have found is that the rapid HIV test, which
provides results within 30 minutes -- the only quick HIV screening assay
approved by the Food and Drug Administration -- is often wrong.&nbsp;
<p>Based on the sometimes false-positive results of this test, women are
requested to begin taking infusions of AIDS medicines to prevent the transmission
of the virus to their unborn child, and the antiretroviral AZT will also
be administered to the baby once it's born. It can take up to 48 hours
for results from further blood tests that are required to confirm the diagnosis
in the mother. Given the unreliability of the rapid screening test, health
professionals are questioning the mandated procedure, occurring at the
highly emotional time of labor and delivery. They are also concerned about
exposing healthy infants unnecessarily to the powerful drug AZT, whose
possible longterm effects remain unknown. <a href="http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/news/newsday.htm">more</a>

<p>A Harvard-educated survey research analyst by profession, John Lauritsen
began reviewing AIDS research in 1983, and is now the leading critical
AIDS journalist. THE AIDS WAR is a collection of his major writings on
AIDS, going back to February 1985. From the introduction: The AIDS epidemic
is an epidemic of lies, through which hundreds of thousands of people have
died and are dying unnecessarily, billions of dollars have gone down the
drain, the Public Health Service has disgraced itself, and Science has
plunged into whoredom. The official AIDS paradigm -- including the preposterous
notion that a biochemically inactive microbe, the so-called "human immunodeficiency
virus" (HIV-1), causes the 29 (at last count) AIDS-indicator diseases --
represents the most colossal blunder in medical history. But it is more
than a blunder. In the course of this book it will become plain why I have
employed the metaphor of war: the terrible suffering and loss of life,
propaganda, censorship, rumors, hysteria, profiteering, espionage, and
sabotage.

<p><font size=+1>Vitamin A reduced HIV transmission to offspring</font><a href="http://www.execpc.com/~keephope/report8.html">(excerpt
from Positive Health News)</a>
<p>Vitamin A: In a study in Africa (Lancet, June 25, 1994, page 1593),
pregnant women with the highest serum levels of Vitamin A reduced HIV transmission
to their offspring to 7% compared to those with the lowest blood levels
of Vitamin A who had a HIV transmission rate of 32% to their offspring.
The authors of the article, Semba, Miotti, Saah at al, wrote: The underlying
biological mechanisms concerning vitamin A in mother-to-child transmission
may include the essential role vitamin A plays in immunity and maintenance
of mucosal surfaces...Lack of vitamin A is associated with compromised
T-cell and B-cell function which may contribute to higher viral loads...In
contrast, a study with AZT(Zidovudine), in HIV+ pregnant women showed that
the group receiving the AZT reduced the rate of HIV transmission to 8.3%
compared to 25.5% in the control&nbsp; group. Vitamin A certainly was as
effective as AZT in reducing the rate of HIV transmission. The unasked
question is whether vitamin A reduced the rate of HIV transmission because
it activated the immune system to produce more white blood cells which
in&nbsp; turn produced antibodies to inactivate the HIV virus. On a side
note, one person I spoke with recently told me that several years ago,
when he had low white blood cells, his physician prescribed vitamin A supplementation
to build up the white blood cells. He told me his white blood cells returned
to normal values. Increasing white blood cell counts through vitamin A
supplementation, suntanning or through the use of the drug, Neupogen, available
from your Physician, increases White Blood Cells, the foundation of most
immune system cells. Shark Liver Oil increases the production of gamma
interferon, which increases CD4 counts. <a href="http://www.execpc.com/~keephope/report8.html">more</a>...

<p>Jane Doe in Montreal refuses to give toxic, lifelong medication to her
two healthy sons, and loses custody of them. Another woman in Montreal
hears this and decides to have an abortion. A woman in Maine has a daughter
die on this medication, and finds that the debilitating symptoms she and

takes her to court, but she wins her case. A couple in Oregon are less

will follow forced testing.
<p>All these people have one thing in common--both they and their children

network of organizations who question the HIV = AIDS = Death paradigm based

<br><font size=+1>�<a href="aids.htm#christine">What if Everything You�d
Been Told About AIDS was Wrong�</a> makes for sobering reading.&nbsp;</font>
<p>"I was required by law to take an HIV test in June 1995. The test is
mandatory in Colorado for pregnant women, and I was expecting my second
child. I was shocked when the result came back positive, because I�d been
married and monogamous for nine years.&nbsp; I started taking AZT in my
fifth month. After ten months on AZT, I was sick all the time. I had constant
diarrhoea, nausea, fever, night sweats and was totally exhausted. I was
crawling to the bathroom and vomiting for hours. My doctor told me the
HIV was making me ill, and that the virus had mutated into a form that
was resistant to AZT. Further drugs turned my skin yellow with jaundice.
Since it was clear that the drugs weren�t keeping me from getting AIDS
and were actually destroying my liver, I let my prescription run out. I
figured I�d rather die from AIDS than liver failure.&nbsp;
<p>Almost immediately after I stopped taking my medicines, within a matter
of days I started to feel much better�.My daughter is considered a success
by medical standards because she tests negative, but I don�t care about
HIV anymore. I am concerned about the effects of the AZT she was poisoned
with while I was pregnant. Rachel has an enlarged cranium, seizures and
a strange deformity near the base of her spine. At age three she still
does not speak. I went to this conference on HIV and pregnancy at The Children�s
Hospital here in Denver. A lot of mothers there had taken AZT during pregnancy
and had their kids with them. Every single one of those kids had enlarged
craniums. Their heads looked exactly like Rachel�s. They�re all AZT babies.
I�m working now to repeal Colorado�s mandatory [HIV] testing law."

virus is not a contributing factor to AIDS is gaining international attention.
In March 1993, Karen Park, International Educational Development, Inc.,
spoke at the United Nations concerning infants with the HIV virus, " .
. . infants were treated with AZT, a drug whose extreme toxicity is under
scrutiny . . . there was no rational reason to give HIV-positive babies

<p>"Project Aids International (PAI) submitted evidence during this United
Nations session that the United States Government and the manufacturer
of AZT (Wellcome Foundation, Ltd. London) had sufficient knowledge as early
as 1961 that AZT was a deadly toxin. PAI further attests that "both the

Against Biological Threat Claim Harsh Side Effects. </b>"...But soon after
his first inoculation in February, the 29-years-old Mr. Nietupski showed
up at an urgent -care facility with sores all over his mouth and throat.
"The side of my tongue was all raw with little canker sores, and bloody
mucus was coming out of my nose, " Mr. Nietupski says. His maladies, ultimately
diagnosed as an autoimmune disorder in which his body accidentaly attacked
itself, grew worse as he got the next two installements of the six-shot

About the Drug Companies : How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The medical establishment works closely with the drug multinationals whose
main objective is profits, and whose worst nightmare would be an epidemic
of good health. Lots of drugs MUST be sold. In order to achieve this, anything

of the drug companies. " <b>Guylaine Lanctot, M.D</b>.&nbsp;</font></font>
