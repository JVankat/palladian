<p><b>Chapter 8</b></p>

<p><b>CAMPAIGNS OF THE NEW EMPIRE</b></p></center>

<p>The &quot;splendid little war&quot; was over almost as soon as it began, and in the 

United States even disease was defeated within a few months. But for U.S. forces 

in the Far East, the surrender of the Spanish was only the start of a long 

struggle. Beginning in the spring of 1900 and continuing for years thereafter, 

soldiers in the Philippines would be involved in guerrilla warfare, and the 

medical officers with them would face challenges rendered more demanding than 

those of the Indian wars both by the complexities of the campaigns and by the 

tropical climate and its diseases. American soldiers and marines would also be 

called upon to join troops from other major powers to end violence engendered in 

China by members of a secret organization, the Boxers, who, with the tacit 

approval of the Dowager Empress, sought to end foreign exploitation of their 

nation. The physicians with them would be required to deal with the consequences 

of generations of abysmally poor sanitation and of the diseases that inevitably 

resulted.</p>

<center>

<p><i>The Philippine Insurrection</i></p></center>

<p>The defeat of the Spanish brought in mid-August 1898 only a short respite for 

General Merritt's VIII Corps. During this period, beginning shortly after the 

surrender, a flurry of changes took place at the highest level of command in the 

Philippines. On 25 August the 1st Division of the VIII Corps was organized under 

the command of General Anderson, who was recently promoted to major general in 

the volunteers. On the twenty-eighth Anderson was relieved as commander of the 

2d Division by Arthur MacArthur, now too a new major general in the volunteers, 

and General Merritt as commanding general of the VIII Corps by Elwell S. Otis, 

also a major general in the volunteers. On the twenty-ninth Otis also relieved 

Merritt as military governor and commanding officer of the Department of the 

Pacific.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Thus General Otis was in command of U.S. forces in the Philippines when, in 

February 1899, the Filipinos, suspicious about the motives of their liberators, 

turned to violence, initially in the form of warfare as orthodox as it could be 

among the narrow jungle trails and waterways that surrounded Manila. U.S. units, 

and the medical officers accompanying them, gained their first taste of what was 

to come when they attempted to defeat their new enemy and found themselves 

struggling to penetrate the mountains northwest of Manila-essentially impassable 

for vehicles-and, once beyond the mountains, to progress along bad roads and 

across &quot;insecure&quot; bridges. These early efforts were success-</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>202
  
</p>


<p>ful, but U.S. troops were not yet ready to seize and retain control of any 

extensive area, because all the volunteers and a third of the regulars in the 

VIII Corps were entitled to return home in the spring of 1899. When the 

volunteers of 1898 were mustered out, they were replaced by 35,000 men of new 

United States Volunteer regiments. By the autumn of 1899, with the arrival of 

new troops, U.S. forces in the Philippines numbered 66,000, more than 30,000 of 

them volunteers.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>The Americans now moved to take control of the islands, beginning with Luzon 

and a three-pronged push north of Manila (<i>Map 4</i>). In this campaign too, 

as Secretary of War Elihu Root noted in his report for 1899, &quot;all . . . 

movements were accomplished under great difficulties owing to the almost 

impassable condition of the country.&quot; By the end of November the resistance was 

abandoning its attempts to conduct conventional warfare, and U.S. troops in 

northern Luzon were &quot;actively pursuing the flying and scattered bands of 

insurgents, further dispersing them. . . . &quot; American forces soon extended the 

drive to take complete control of the Philippines to the east and south of 

Manila as well, into another area of difficult terrain. So successful were these 

efforts that by the spring of 1900 General Otis concluded that the insurrection 

had been defeated and in May asked to be relieved. Nevertheless, troops under 

General MacArthur, who replaced Otis as commanding general in the Philippines, 

still faced guerrilla attacks and had to remain in the field and establish what 

would eventually be more than 500 posts to hold what they had 

taken.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>During the earliest and most conventional stage of the Philippine 

Insurrection, a single military department formed the basis for the government 

of the islands. The organization of VIII Corps medical personnel still reflected 

that of the corps itself. A chief surgeon headed the medical service of the 

entire corps, and a chief surgeon was assigned to each division and brigade of 

the corps. The regimental staff, which normally consisted of three physicians, 

increased significantly after the change from more conventional warfare to a 

guerrilla conflict in early 1900 and the increase in the number of posts that 

resulted. Eventually, although as many as seven medical officers sometimes 

served on a regimental staff, their numbers could still be too small to provide 

a physician for each garrison in its district. As a result, hospital corpsmen 

might be assigned to assume the physician's role for the smallest detachments 

and subposts.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>At the end of March 1900 the complexities involved in dealing with the 

guerrillas and governing the islands led to the transformation of what had been 

the Department of the Pacific into the Division of the Philippines with four 

geographical departments, each of which was, in turn, divided into military 

districts. This step brought an end to the VIII Corps.<sup>5</sup> The corps 

chief surgeon become the chief surgeon of the Division of the Philippines. The 

position of the chief surgeon of a military division was transformed into that 

of the chief surgeon of a department and that of the chief surgeon of a brigade 

into that of the chief surgeon of a district. The district form of organization 

was dropped late in 1901 and replaced by an organization by 

brigade.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>The government of the Philippines changed again in the spring of 1901, after 

U.S. forces captured the chief guerrilla leader, Emilio Aguinaldo. Although 

minor guerrilla activity would continue for many years thereafter, a successful 

effort to reduce expenses by concentrating resources</p>

<p>was initiated, and the four departments were consolidated into two. President 

McKinley confidently appointed a civilian government for the islands in the form 

of a commission with legislative and limited executive power and a civilian 

governor. By November fewer than 45,000 U.S. soldiers remained of the 100,000 

who at one point were serving in the Philippines.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>Although the organization and size of the medical service in the Philippines 

was adjusted to conform with the organization of the Army and the needs of 

forces spread out over an increasingly large area, the basic nature of the 

challenge facing medical personnel in the field changed only gradually. In this 

primitive land, the terrain controlled medical evacuation, while the number of 

sick and wounded and the difficulties experienced in moving them dictated the 

nature of the hospital system. The change of the conflict from conventional to 

guerrilla warfare in the space of a few months had less direct influence on the 

demands placed on the Medical Department than did the gradual isolation in 

well-nigh inaccessible locations of the small units that were sent to fight the 

guerrillas.</p>

<center>

<p><i>Hospitals and Evacuation</i></p></center>

<p>Initially, the Medical Department's chief responsibility was establishing a 

system of base hospitals in the Manila area to care for the sick, for those 

recovering from wounds sustained in the brief hostilities with the Spanish, and 

for convalescents. The department then expanded the size of this system and 

extended it geographically to care for those disabled during the insurrection 

that followed. In a former Spanish military hospital, Major Crosby set up the 

first division hospital to be established in Manila. Before the first patients 

arrived on 17 August 1898, the building of the newly created First Reserve 

Hospital was thoroughly cleaned and the necessary repairs were made. To avoid 

crowding, Crosby erected tents to handle the overflow. The unsatisfactory state 

of the hospital's plumbing and the poor drainage of the land nearby initially 

caused the Medical Department to be uneasy about using this structure, despite 

its electric lights and excellent ventilation. In time, the sewer system was 

replaced, water closets were installed, and each ward was given its own bathroom 

with showers. The city water works provided ample supplies, from which drinking 

water was distilled.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p>The First Reserve soon became the keystone of the Army's hospital network in 

the Philippines.<sup>9</sup> Its surgical facilities, which included three 

operating rooms, were the most important in Manila. A two-ward smallpox unit was 

established 1,200 yards from the main building; another ward, consisting of two 

tents erected over raised platforms, was added later for those suspected of 

having smallpox; and a third tent was set up to isolate patients suffering from 

bubonic plague, if that disease ever afflicted the Army. All patients arriving 

in Manila by boat came through a First Reserve unit established near the docks, 

where the victims of accidents on the city streets or on the railroad also 

received emergency treatment. The hospital laboratory, set up by Captain McVay, 

was well equipped to handle all pathological examinations for the Manila area. 

This entire division hospital, including the smallpox facility, eventually held 

400 beds. Sixteen mules drew four ambulance wagons around the Manila area to 

pick up patients in response to telegraphed requests for their 

services.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p>Two more hospitals were established not long after the fall of Manila. The

</p>


<p>ond Reserve Hospital opened in September 1898 in a modern and attractive 

building that had been built to serve as a young women's school. With its eight 

porcelain bathtubs and its acres of walled gardens, complete with fountains and 

flowering trees, this facility was &quot;a really fine establishment.&quot; Initially most 

of its 300 beds were assigned to convalescents who were transferred from the 

First Reserve Hospital or from regimental hospitals; but, as time went by and 

the disease rate rose, the seriously ill were also sent there. Convalescents did 

not have to share yet another facility, which was set up on Corregidor Island, a 

site only thirty miles from Manila that was chosen in November because of the 

city's poor health record. The climate was more pleasant than that of the city, 

the natural drainage of the soil was good, the sea air was mild, and many trees 

tempted those whose health was still fragile to rest in their shade. This 

hospital initially occupied tents and a few old buildings, where 250 beds were 

placed. In September 1899, with activity against the Filipinos intensifying, the 

first of a series of new structures was completed to replace the old ones, and 

by June 1900 the facility held 220 beds. As described by the surgeon in charge 

of the Corregidor facility, &quot;The first dental office ever fitted out officially 

by the United States government&quot; was also set up, to be managed by a hospital 

corpsman who in private life had been a professional dentist. Plans to expand 

this hospital had to be suspended because of high construction costs that 

resulted in part from a conspiracy among lumber dealers.<sup>11</sup></p>

<p>In May 1899 another hospital, known simply as Hospital No. 3 or the 

supplementary hospital, was opened just outside the city walls in barracks once 

belonging to the Spanish infantry. An enormous amount of work was necessary to 

make it fit for use. One medical officer noted that &quot;only one who has seen the 

filth can appreciate what that labor was.&quot; Among its 285 patients were those 

scheduled for disability discharges. No civilian nurses served on its staff, 

since the surgeon in charge regarded them as neither necessary nor 

desirable.<sup>12</sup></p>

<p>In November 1899, in response to the mounting disease rate and growing 

activity against guerrillas, the Medical Department increased the number of 

available beds by taking over a former barracks at Santa Mesa, a suburb of 

Manila, for a new 1,000-bed unit. The staff of this new facility, eventually the 

largest in the Philippines, included 10 physicians, 25 female nurses, 4 hospital 

stewards, 2 acting hospital stewards, and 122 Hospital Corps privates. As late 

as June 1900, however, the laboratory of Santa Mesa was regarded as completely 

inadequate, and earth closets had not been replaced by more modern equipment. By 

15 August the hospitals in Manila, together with that on Corregidor, held a 

total of more than 2,200 beds. Space was also available at a 600-bed Navy 

hospital in Yokohama, Japan, and in Hong Kong.<sup>13</sup></p>

<p>The Medical Department used the hospital ships <i>Scandia, Missouri</i>, and 

<i>Relief </i>both to supplement its hospitals on land and to move patients by 

water to and from locations within the Philippine Islands. The <i>Scandia</i>, a 

transport fitted out to serve as a hospital ship and carrying with her 5 medical 

officers and 139 hospital corpsmen, was dispatched from California on 27 August 

1900. Although in the fall of 1899 the <i>Missouri </i>briefly joined the 

transports in taking invalids back to the United States, the <i>Relief</i>, 

which had arrived in the Philippines on 8 April, rarely took patients all the 

way to San Francisco because of her light construction and the limited 

amount</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />

<p>of coal she could carry. Except for service during the China Relief 

Expedition and trips to Hong Kong for repairs, she remained for the most part in 

Philippine waters. As she cruised up and down the coast of the Philippines, 

rendezvousing with units on the march, leaving off supplies, and picking up the 

seriously ill or wounded from regimental surgeons or post hospitals, the 

<i>Relief</i> provided her passengers with a &quot;sea trip and good food.&quot; The 

restorative effect of such a journey upon the debilitated caused the Medical 

Department in March 1901 to put 140 patients on board the <i>Relief </i>merely 

to enjoy the trip from Manila up the coast. More than half her invalid 

passengers, including the 51 she picked up on the way, improved markedly because 

of their sea voyage, and she was assigned to make several more such journeys. 

Because the <i>Relief</i>'s deep draft prevented her from entering shallow 

waters and because a transport that picked up patients from south of Manila was 

equally handicapped, the Medical Department also employed shallow-draft vessels 

to move patients, including a hospital launch that took patients from Manila on 

three- to four-hour sea jaunts.<sup>14</sup></p>

<p>The need for hospital beds dropped significantly following the capture of 

Aguinaldo in March, although some resistance, especially in the form of 

terrorism, continued for several months, and disease remained an enemy even 

after much of the countryside had been pacified. A one-third reduction in the 

number of hospital beds was planned early in 1901, but the mass evacuation of 

patients to the United States upon which the reduction depended progressed more 

slowly than had been anticipated because of a shortage of transports. Only in 

July, when the effort to concentrate the Army's resources in the Philippines 

was</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>208
  
</p>


<p>under way, could one of Manila's facilities, the Second Reserve Hospital, be 

closed. The remaining patients and staff were sent to the Santa Mesa hospital, 

which, in turn, was closed before the end of the year. A 125-bed hospital was 

established on Nozaleda Street in Manila on 18 December to shelter patients 

still hospitalized at Santa Mesa when it was closed. On its attractive grounds a 

20-bed isolation facility was set up in six tents for the victims of 

tuberculosis.<sup>15</sup></p>

<p>Although from the outset the Medical Department relied heavily on the major 

hospitals of Manila and Corregidor, supplemented by those on hospital ships, 

much smaller facilities on the transports returning patients to the United 

States were also available. The Army Transport Service, established in November 

1898, was responsible for seeing that each ship had the proper facilities for 

its passengers, whether they were en route to the Philippines or on their way 

home. The larger vessels of the Transport Service carried hospitals complete 

with isolation wards and diet kitchens, and even smaller ships carried medical 

personnel to care for the sick. Two Regular Army surgeons served as medical 

superintendents for the Transport Service, one in New York and the other in San 

Francisco. Their duties included advising the service's general superintendent 

in each city, supervising the work of the contract surgeons on service ships, 

and inspecting each vessel. A contract surgeon who was chosen by examination 

from among applicants who were graduates of &quot;regular reputable&quot; medical schools 

accompanied each transport, as did a hospital steward or acting hospital steward 

and one to three Hospital Corps privates. Thus, by relying on transports 

equipped with hospital facilities, the Army could return the sick and wounded to 

the United States without using hospital ships.<sup>16</sup></p>

<p>Establishing the system of base hospitals, hospital ships, and transports was 

not as great a challenge as caring for the sick and wounded when troops were 

pushing through the jungle, far from good roads and intact portions of the rail 

line. Initially, medical officers did not anticipate the difficulties they would 

soon be encountering in the struggle with the Filipinos. As chief surgeon of the 

VIII Corps, Colonel Lippincott had planned a system of field hospitals in which 

he had great confidence. In the winter of 1899 he rejoiced that the medical 

service in the Philippines had been &quot;in fine condition at the moment of first 

fire&quot; and had &quot;continued to improve from day to day, so that there was never a 

delay in securing excellent attention for the wounded.&quot;<sup>17</sup></p>

<p>In the early spring of 1899, when troops began pushing as much as thirty 

miles beyond Manila, they encountered terrain that made evacuation very 

difficult, regardless of the size of the units involved or the nature of the 

operation. When the Army began working in smaller units to deal with the 

guerrillas and the number of posts more than tripled during the first six months 

of 1900 to &quot;embrac[e] the furthermost limits of the islands,&quot; the lightly 

equipped field hospitals that accompanied the men had to become both smaller and 

more numerous. The nature of the problems involved in moving the disabled first 

to such small facilities and then from them to the rail line or to a major 

hospital did not change.<sup>18</sup></p>

<p>To carry litters for these units in the field, natives of the area, and 

sometimes even prisoners, were hired or impressed into service, but for a time 

the most successful bearer was the Chinese coolie. If assured of his pay and 

rations, the coolie proved to be, according to some authorities, &quot;patient, 

tireless, and brave&quot; and better able to bear great heat than American</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>209
  
</p>


<p>hospital corpsmen. Others were considerably less enthusiastic about this 

practice. General Schwan, who commanded forces involved in the campaign in 

southern Luzon in late 1899 and early 1900, considered &quot;the use of coolies, 

either for company or hospital use on a campaign, . . . injurious to discipline 

and of no value to the service.&quot; He regarded them as &quot;great looters,&quot; noting 

that &quot;about all they do after a few days' march is to carry their own food and 

what they have stolen out of houses and churches.&quot; Early in 1900, when the end 

of the conflict seemed near and an awareness of the threat that cheap Chinese 

labor posed to local workers was growing, the Army forbad the hiring of Chinese 

for this type of work in the Philippines.<sup>19</sup></p>

<p>Evacuation demanded much from those responsible for moving the wounded, 

especially from the many areas that were inaccessible to wheeled vehicles. The 

poorest lines of communications were in the Camarines area of southeastern 

Luzon. An officer leading two of the four companies involved in an operation in 

late February and early March 1900 reported:</p>

<p>The trails on either side . . . are something that language can 

not describe. In all my experience in the mountains of Colorado, in the Bad 

Lands of Montana, in Cuba, and other parts of the world where I have traveled, I 

have never seen worse. They are single-file trails the greater part of the way, 

closely hedged in by a dense jungle of trees and undergrowth, with mud and mire 

on the sides. Then every few hundred yards a mountain stream must be forded, the 

banks of these streams being precipitous, with a drop of 40 to 70 feet. The cut 

down these banks resembles a tunnel, except that it is open at the top. . . . 

Nor is it possible to flank these positions, on account of the dense growth, nor 

can anything be seen except directly to the front, and then only for a short 

distance.</p>

<p>Because units fighting in the countryside could not take large amounts of 

equipment with them, corpsmen sometimes had to improvise litters from bark, 

bamboo, or items of clothing just as surgeons had done in the Indian wars. Some 

trails were too narrow and twisting to permit the use of travois, and each 

litter had to be carried by four men.<sup>20</sup></p>

<p>Even in areas from which wheeled vehicles could carry the disabled directly 

to a hospital or to a train or vessel that would take them the remaining 

distance to a hospital, difficulties arose. Native carts, including one 

described as &quot;distantly related to the one-horse buggy,&quot; sometimes had to be 

substituted for the few available ambulances, which tended to be both old and 

fragile. The animals that pulled these wagons were usually either mules or 

native ponies so small that they had to be unhitched to swim across deep 

streams, leaving the larger mules to make several trips back and forth with the 

carts. Major Cardwell, now chief surgeon of the 1st Division, noted while with 

an expedition to the north of Manila in the spring of 1899 that ponies that were 

often &quot;balky and vicious&quot; forced &quot;the hardest kind of physical labor&quot; upon all 

the men with an ambulance train. In April of that year, another kind of problem 

arose when a bridge north of Manila proved too badly damaged for use. The chief 

surgeon of the 2d Division, Maj. Henry F. Hoyt of the U.S. Volunteers, reported 

that ambulances had to disgorge four dead and twenty-six wounded on one side of 

a river. A small canoe then picked them up, going back and forth until all had 

been deposited in a second set of vehicles on the far shore. Patients brought to 

the coast near Manila might be spared further land travel if they could reach a 

hospital launch to take them to one of the city's facilities. But reaching the 

launch from the shore was complicated</p>

</p>


<p>when the water was so shallow that only &quot;a fair size flat boat&quot; could move 

supine patients out to the larger vessel.<sup>21</sup></p>

<p>Advancing along the rail line was also difficult when roads were lacking and 

the track was in poor condition. Initially, only portions of the rail line that 

ran north of Manila were open for use, and patients were sometimes evacuated in 

handcars operated by Filipino prisoners or, at best, in boxcars equipped with 

cots. The ability to use the railroad greatly eased the problems involved in 

evacuation. By mid-1900 cars specifically equipped to move patients were part of 

a train sent along the complete length of the line each day.<sup>22</sup></p>

<p>The hospitals that lay along the line of evacuation varied greatly in size 

and number, according to the distance from the major facilities of the Manila 

area, the difficulties involved in evacuation, and the nature of the campaign 

under way. For men who were only slightly injured, the application in the field 

of an initial dressing taken from the first aid packet often eliminated entirely 

the need for hospitalization. From the beginning of the insurrection, dressing 

stations, sometimes referred to as light field hospitals, accompanied troops in 

the field to care for the sick and wounded until a more permanent facility could 

be found or set up for them. When units were serving in the jungle far from 

roads and navigable waterways, dressing stations sheltered those who might have 

to accompany their units for several days before evacuation became 

possible.<sup>23</sup></p>

<p>Since small hospitals lightened the load of larger institutions and patients 

could be returned to duty more expeditiously if they remained nearer the front, 

regimental facilities were occasionally utilized in the field. As Colonel 

Greenleaf, who became chief surgeon for the troops in the Philippines in January 

1900,<sup>24</sup> noted in his report of 15 August, they were &quot;for emergency 

purposes only.&quot; Here, as many as 14 percent of the sick and wounded in the 

Philippines might be receiving care at any one time. Surgeons with troops on the 

move also set up camp hospitals, where those who were only slightly ill could 

rest for a brief period before returning to duty. These small hospitals were 

often housed in native dwellings, and native beds were used if the five to ten 

cots issued for this purpose proved insufficient. In areas where the troops 

could be cut off from large facilities by the weather and deteriorating roads, 

camp hospitals were organized before the rainy season. The Medical Department 

preferred to avoid relying on small hospitals, however, because they represented 

an inefficient use of personnel and caused administrative confusion. Thus, as 

the campaign progressed, larger ones were established in the field, sometimes in 

abandoned Spanish facilities of major towns, for the care of those with more 

than trivial injuries.<sup>25</sup></p>

<p>As U.S. forces advanced, the network of larger hospitals set up in the 

countryside was extended to spare patients the ordeal of evacuation. Although 

the journey south to Manila by rail from San Fernando, captured in the spring of 

1900, was less than fifty miles, it might take twelve hours. Before hospital 

cars became available, the move could be particularly trying for the sick and 

wounded. Thus 2d Division surgeons at San Fernando, which was directly on the 

railroad line, set aside five buildings for a 200-bed field hospital. In October 

1899, when the campaign to take northern Luzon was just getting under way, this 

facility was moved further north to a church in Angeles, also on the rail line, 

where by mid-August it still held more than 100 beds. By then</p>

</p>


<p>the largest base hospital on northern Luzon was the approximately 350-bed 

facility established in December 1899 at Dagupan, ideally located at the 

northern end of the rail line from Manila and on the coast as well. Patients 

from advanced units were brought to Dagupan for care or for evacuation back to 

Manila or to the United States. A wood and masonry building once belonging to a 

Dominican college housed this hospital. By the spring of 1900 fifteen trained 

nurses there had earned the praise of the surgeon in charge, who reported that 

he found it &quot;a satisfaction to have in immediate charge of the sick persons 

trained to do the work&quot; and that he was unhappy that the only lodging he could 

offer these women was native houses.<sup>26</sup></p>

<p>The establishment of many small post hospitals reminiscent of those once 

scattered about the American West, some merely dispensaries, or subpost 

hospitals, precipitated many of the same problems that Surgeon General 

Sternberg's predecessors had come to know so well during the Indian wars in the 

United States. The shortage of medical officers was chronic as long as these 

small posts were required, and keeping each facility adequately supplied with 

medicines and equipment was difficult. As the area under U.S. control expanded, 

however, smaller hospitals could be consolidated, and the need for a multitude 

of extremely mobile or very short-lived hospitals also diminished. The Medical 

Department continued to establish larger and more permanent institutions, 

variously classified as field, brigade, and base hospitals, usually of 50 or 

more beds, where men with typhoid, malaria, chronic dysentery, or wounds 

requiring skilled surgery could be cared for without being evacuated back to the 

Manila area. Such facilities were located where they could be easily supplied, 

along the rail line or the coast. When necessary, patients could be easily 

evacuated from them, either to Manila or to transports that would take them 

home.<sup>27</sup></p>

<p>Representative of Medical Department field organization as it had developed 

by the spring of 1900, six months after the initiation of the drive to control 

Luzon, was the hospital system in the most northern district of the island. It 

consisted of a fifty- to sixty-bed unit on the northern coast at Aparri and five 

post and camp hospitals, all housed in buildings considered comfortable. The ten 

medical officers who accompanied the one regular regiment and two battalions of 

a volunteer regiment stationed in the district had to be divided among the 

hospitals, and their supplies and equipment also had to be parceled out among 

six institutions. Forty-one hospital corpsmen, including a graduate dentist, 

were required to care for the patients at Aparri and to handle the clerical 

work. Because the facility was likely to be needed for some time to come, the 

surgeon in charge also requested contract nurses, obtained permission to acquire 

an ice plant, and sought to obtain a small steam laundry and iron 

bedsteads.<sup>28</sup></p>

<p>The hospital network serving 1st Division forces fighting in southern Luzon 

resembled that of the 2d Division north of Manila, but on a smaller scale. By 

mid-August 1900 the largest hospital was the base facility at Calamba, on Laguna 

de Bay, which was rivaled for size by the brigade hospital at Bacoor, on the 

coast south of Manila, each of which held more than 100 beds. A 60-bed hospital 

stood at Santa Cruz, on the eastern side of the Laguna, while two smaller base 

hospitals were also located along the seacoast south of Manila. Since almost 

every town in this area had a substantial church building that could be</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>213
  
</p>


<p>taken over to serve as a hospital, here, too, even the smallest facilities 

were well housed. In the absence of a rail line, ambulance wagons had to be used 

to move patients from mobile and temporary facilities to base hospitals, from 

which water transportation could be used, if necessary, to reach 

Manila.<sup>29</sup></p>

<p>The Bacoor facility, established in July 1899, before the beginning of the 

guerrilla phase of the insurrection, was for some time the largest in southern 

Luzon. Since it was only twelve miles from Manila by sea and fourteen by land, 

it was a good point through which to deliver supplies and evacuate patients. 

Although in the spring of 1900 tents at Bacoor held 85 of a total of 125 

patients, surgeons were pleased with the situation because the tents were cool. 

The Calamba hospital, set up in a former Spanish convent in February, was 

initially smaller than that at Bacoor. Located in an area swarming with 

mosquitoes carrying dengue or malaria, it eventually grew to shelter more than 

150 patients, with hospital corpsmen assisting the eight female nurses who were 

responsible for patient care.<sup>30</sup></p>

<p>Hospitals were also established where needed on the various smaller islands 

of the Philippines, with a particularly large facility set up as a brigade 

hospital in February 1899 at Iloilo, on Panay in the Visayan Islands. Originally 

located in a private home, one of the few buildings that had not been burned by 

the insurgents, the hospital grew by taking over other private homes until by 

February 1900 it had 300 beds. The use of several separate buildings, however, 

made for an inefficient use of staff, since more hospital corpsmen were required 

to care for patients than would have been necessary in one structure. The 

shortage of medical personnel was also demonstrated in the spring, when 

twenty-five posts in these islands, which included those of Samar, Leyte, Cebu, 

and Bohol as well as Panay, lacked a medical officer. The surgeons circulating 

between inland substations often encountered almost impassable roads and 

guerrilla attacks, while those visiting coastal positions required the services 

of a hard-to-find steamer or sailboat.<sup>31</sup></p>

<center>

<p><i>Medical Personnel</i></p></center>

<p>The shortage of physicians and hospital corpsmen was one of the greatest 

challenges to those responsible for the care and evacuation of the sick and 

wounded of occupation troops in the Philippines. The Washington Barracks program 

for training hospital corpsmen had been for a time suspended because of the 

demands of the war, but it was resumed shortly thereafter. A similar school for 

corpsmen was opened at Angel Island, California, so that men could be taught 

while they awaited embarkation for the Philippines. In the twelve-month period 

ending in June 1900, 692 trained at Angel Island and 726 at Washington Barracks, 

with most of both groups sent to the Pacific. The first class from a fourteen- 

to eighteen-week course for future acting hospital stewards taught at Manila's 

Hospital No. 3 graduated in June. In spite of the establishment of these 

schools, many corpsmen in the Philippines had little experience or formal 

training, although they seem to have been wisely selected. One surgeon reported 

that &quot;he never knew of a hospital corps man who failed in his duty in any way 

under fire.&quot; Another later commented that the Hospital Corps had much improved 

since the Spanish-American War, many stewards and even some privates being 

&quot;capable of rendering very valuable assistance</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>214
  
</p>


<p>to the surgeons.&quot; Keeping the proportion of corpsmen to the number of wounded 

high so as to guarantee casualties adequate attention on the field caused the 

demand for attendants to remain greater than the supply. Nevertheless, by August 

the Army was preparing to cut back the number of hospital corpsmen in the 

Philippines from 2,356 to 2,000, as required by Congress. The Medical Department 

warned that many problems could be anticipated as a result unless a greater 

number of Filipinos could be found to replace them.<sup>32</sup></p>

<p>With some hesitation, Secretary of War Alger allowed female nurses to be sent 

in from the United States to supplement the work of hospital corpsmen. According 

to Colonel Greenleaf, they became known in the Pacific for their &quot;good work,&quot; 

which was &quot;much appreciated by all.&quot; By mid-August 1900, 140 of these women had 

served in hospitals in the Philippines and 120 were still on duty there, along 

with 7 male contract nurses. Improving conditions in the interior of the 

Philippines eventually made it feasible to send American women to some of the 

facilities located further out into the countryside.<sup>33</sup></p>

<p>The need to provide medical coverage for a multitude of posts increased the 

demand for physicians and caused a shortage of medical officers so severe that 

Surgeon General Sternberg had to send in doctors who were unfamiliar with 

military medicine and who created confusion as a result. He again used the 

latest edition of the <i>Manual for the Medical Department </i>in his attempt to 

indoctrinate the new physicians. Ironically, many of them were contract surgeons 

whose contracts would run out just at that point when they were becoming most 

effective and who might leave even earlier, as soon as the novelty of the 

situation began to pale. Because of the shortage, at various times a contract 

doctor from the <i>Relief </i>was brought ashore, Navy physicians were pressed 

into Army service, or hospital corpsmen were left to assume responsibilities 

usually managed by physicians. Corpsmen often had to be responsible for reports 

and administrative duties when camp surgeons had no time for such things, but in 

one instance two corpsmen had to perform an amputation. Unfortunately, because 

more hospital corpsmen were also needed-when General MacArthur requested the 

&quot;immediate dispatch&quot; of 100 more medical officers in July 1900, he also asked 

for 300 more corpsmen-having them fill in for physicians merely exacerbated one 

problem in the attempt to ease another.<sup>34</sup></p>

<p>The need for physicians increased so rapidly that Colonel Greenleaf could not 

keep up with the demand. On 31 December 1899, when 257 physicians were serving 

in the Philippines, the chief surgeon concluded that he should have 360. By 31 

May 1900, when he reported that 364 were serving under him, medical officers 

were lacking for 20 new posts that had been recently established and 5 to 10 

more were needed to accompany two transports returning to the United States from 

the Philippines. As a result, in June Greenleaf called for 75 more surgeons and 

for 20 more to be sent each month thereafter. Although as many physicians as 

could be spared were sent in, by the end of the fiscal year 1900, 120 posts out 

of the almost 400 then in the Philippines still had no surgeons, leaving 10,000 

men without a source of adequate care. Concerned that the situation in the 

Philippines might be misunderstood, General MacArthur emphasized to the adjutant 

general that as long as the number of posts in the Philippines remained 

constant, the number of medical officers required would</p>

<p>also remain constant, regardless of the number of troops serving there. By 31 

May 1901, although the situation had improved, 479 posts lacked medical 

attendance and only 423 surgeons were available for assignment. Greenleaf 

maintained that because of the need to have a reserve against the possibility of 

epidemic, the figure should be at least 500.<sup>35</sup></p>

<p>In the 2d Division, difficulties engendered by the shortage of physicians 

were exacerbated by confusion over the responsibility for the assignment of 

surgeons and the granting of their leave in 1899. Communications between the 

headquarters and the units strung out from Manila to the Gulf of Lingayen were 

poor. Orders given to medical officers at many levels were rarely reported back 

to Colonel Greenleaf at corps headquarters. Local commanding officers granted 

leave to surgeons and then requested the assignment of another surgeon when no 

replacements were available. Early in 1900 orders were issued requiring that the 

division chief surgeons be informed whenever leave was granted to a medical 

officer and that each brigade surgeon keep a current roster of the medical 

officers and hospital corpsmen in his unit. Changes of assignment were to be 

reported to the brigade surgeon as soon as they were made.<sup>36</sup></p>

<p>Medical officers assigned to the Philippines experienced their share of 

danger because of the guerrilla war, still further reducing the number available 

to care for the sick and wounded. A surgeon was one of the thirty-six men killed 

and horribly mutilated by bolo knife-wielding guerrillas in September 1901 in a 

surprise attack upon the garrison at Balangiga, on Samar. Yet another surgeon 

barely escaped death when he was ambushed during his attempt to bring ambulances 

to the aid of wounded insurgents. The shortage forced many physi-</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>216
  
</p>


<p>cians to spend much time riding through the hostile countryside from post to 

post, each five to fifteen miles from the other.<sup>37</sup></p>

<p>In spite of the difficulty medical officers experienced in providing adequate 

care for American soldiers, some had the time to care for Filipinos. 

Unfortunately, in at least some instances they may have been involved in 

extracting information from captured Filipinos, who were considered to be waging 

&quot;irregular warfare against the only constituted authority&quot; and therefore were, 

in theory, &quot;merely bandits, . . . and as such . . . not entitled to treatment as 

prisoners of war.&quot; Americans serving in the Philippines evidently did not always 

regard torture as reprehensible; but, to prevent serious or permanent injury to 

the victim, a medical officer was apparently often present when torture was 

being used. Army surgeons did not take their scorn for the guerrillas as far as 

to neglect Filipino casualties, though they were more difficult to care for than 

American soldiers because they tended to remove dressings and touch their 

wounds. Even with the best of intentions, medical officers were unable to 

achieve as good results with Filipino wounded as with their own men, although 

their attempts nevertheless contributed to pacification 

efforts.<sup>38</sup></p>

<center>

<p><i>Health of the Troops</i></p></center>

<p>For troops fighting in the Philippines, as it was for those in the Caribbean, 

disease was the cause of most disability and death. Combat injuries took only 

10.6 percent of the command out of action in the first half of 1900, for 

example, and rarely caused difficulties for American surgeons treating their own 

men, even when wounds were caused by bolo knives, daggers, knives, bamboo 

spears, and clubs. The surgical operations performed on U.S. soldiers in the 

Philippines more often involved hernias, appendicitis, liver abscesses, 

malignancies, and other problems unrelated to war wounds.<sup>39</sup></p>

<p>The real challenge resulted from the cumulative and debilitating effect of 

physical exhaustion, inadequate diet, temperatures of well over 100 degrees, and 

malaria and the various forms of dysentery upon men already working under great 

stress. Medical officers became the victims of diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, 

malaria, and sheer exhaustion; Lippincott himself was among those felled by 

disease. Soldiers at the front suffered the highest disease rates, as much as 

three times those experienced by the garrisons of even the most unsanitary 

towns, where rates were usually under 10 percent. Attention to personal hygiene 

and the use of screens and nettings to prevent mosquito bites were almost 

impossible for soldiers fighting guerrillas in the jungle. &quot;The terrible nervous 

exhaustion which results from long continued exposure to great heat and 

moisture,&quot; as one Army surgeon put it, severely undermined effectiveness, 

although with time many men became better able to tolerate the heat. For the 

1900-1901 fiscal year period the disease rate among the volunteers, who were for 

the most part new in the country, rose by almost 50 percent, while among 

acclimated regulars it fell by 10 percent. The gradual end of active campaigning 

contributed to a drop in the disease rate, but physicians concluded after months 

of experience that many patients would never entirely recover if they remained 

in the Philippines.<sup>40</sup></p>

<p>Although typhoid was endemic and the troops arriving in 1898 came from camps 

where typhoid had been a problem, careful attention to sanitation reduced its 

inroads</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>217
  
</p>


<p>markedly. Despite its high death rate, this disease was never the serious 

threat to the Army's effectiveness in the Philippines that it had been both in 

the United States and in the Caribbean in the summer of 1898. New volunteer 

units coming in from the United States to replace state volunteer units 

returning home continued to bring typhoid with them, and from time to time 

medical officers feared an epidemic. Occasional cases were acquired at local 

restaurants or from streams so &quot;clear and sparkling&quot; that the troops drank 

directly from them until the appearance of typhoid made them realize the error 

of their ways. Heat exhaustion, an ever-present threat, added to the typhoid 

danger. In moments of desperation when extreme heat led to the rapid emptying of 

canteens, soldiers were willing to drink &quot;from ditches and holes when the water 

looked green and tasted very badly,&quot; though they knew that it was hazardous to 

do so. Renewed attention to sanitation and to the accuracy of diagnoses, 

however, limited the spread of this disease.<sup>41</sup></p>

<p>Return to the United States was believed particularly necessary to the 

complete recovery of the victim of dysentery, which, together with diarrhea, 

caused much havoc to the health of those serving in the Philippines. Dysentery 

and diarrhea rates climbed until they were four or more times higher than the 

rate characteristic of the peacetime Army in the United States, and, as time 

went by, dysentery seemed to become more virulent. The death rate rose from 2.52 

per 1,000 troops in 1898 to 4.58 per 1,000 in 1899, perhaps because the stress 

of active campaigning lowered resistance. A few cases were identified as amebic, 

but at some hospitals the most commonly seen cases were those in which malaria 

was accompanied by dysentery. In these instances, good results in the treatment 

of dysentery were often achieved with quinine, and many physicians concluded 

that blood tests for malaria should be administered to all dysentery sufferers. 

An increase in diarrhea cases in the spring of 1899 was blamed in part on the 

indiscriminate consumption of the locally available fruits. Surgeons also noted 

that many of the men with diarrhea were also among the many serving in the 

tropics who had very bad teeth, and they blamed this apparent and unexplained 

coincidence on the climate.<sup>42</sup></p>

<p>Although dysentery tended to peak in the summer, the rainy season in the 

Philippines, malaria caused much ineffectiveness from October through December, 

the coolest months of the year, and was more common inland than along the coast 

or in the area around Manila. The form of malaria seen in the Far East tended to 

recur but constituted no appreciable direct threat to life, even though, because 

of its chronic nature, it tended to wear out its victims. The time the malaria 

victim spent in the hospital was often lengthened because of the accompanying 

diarrhea, for which one gram of quinine twice a day proved to be a very 

successful treatment. Discretion was necessary in prescribing quinine, however. 

Attempts to give quinine by injection to increase the speed with which it acted 

tended to produce local abscesses. Too prolonged a course of quinine, moreover, 

was believed to lead to mental and nervous complications and even 

anemia.<sup>43</sup></p>

<p>Among other threats to health, venereal diseases apparently posed the 

greatest challenge to physicians. Major Cardwell, then the 2d Division chief 

surgeon, reported in September 1898 that as the men became &quot;habituated to the 

repulsiveness of the native women, sexual immorality [became] more common,&quot; as 

did syphilis and gonorrhea. In 1902 a medical officer noted</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>218
  
</p>


<p>in an article in a professional journal that the rate of venereal disease in 

the Philippines was not unusual and that this fact was &quot;a tribute to the 

Filipino women who, as a class, I do not hesitate to say, are fully as virtuous 

as their American sisters.&quot; An attempt to register and inspect prostitutes, 

hospitalizing those found to be diseased, was strongly opposed by a visiting 

missionary, who wrote the secretary of war that such a program was tantamount to 

licensing prostitution. The paucity of healthful amusements lowered morale, 

although the amount of drunkenness and alcoholism, so often associated with high 

venereal disease rates, seemed no greater than that usually found in the United 

States. Canteens where cool beer could be bought, together with hard work and 

hard play, were seen as minimizing the temptation to associate &quot;with natives, of 

the lowest class&quot; and as relieving any &quot;craving for immoral pursuit.&quot; 

Authorities attempted to set up a resort for troops in the mountains of north 

Luzon, but the lack of roads held up the project. An order issued in 1901 

requiring all men to be inspected weekly for signs of such diseases was, to some 

degree at least, successful in lowering the incidence.<sup>44</sup></p>

<p>Among lesser threats to health and effectiveness were smallpox and bubonic 

plague epidemics that developed in the Filipino population of Manila. Although 

plague never became a problem for U.S. troops, the first case of smallpox was 

diagnosed early in September 1898. By 31 March 1899, when the danger was 

considered to be over, 236 American soldiers had contracted the disease and 77 

had died of it. Fresh smallpox vaccine had proved difficult to obtain. The 

effectiveness of matter sent from San Francisco did not survive the long voyage, 

and new supplies obtained from Japan deteriorated in the heat. When a former 

Spanish vaccine farm was reactivated, it became possible to revaccinate the 

entire command-along with all 13,000 Spanish prisoners of war who had 

surrendered at Manila the previous summer-with matter fresh, not from the cow, 

but from the water buffalo.<sup>45</sup></p>

<p>Skin problems were also often seen, since soldiers fighting in the 

Philippines were sometimes constantly wet for days. Ringworm, a fungal infection 

that usually responded to treatment with sulfur, was common. Sometimes, however, 

it was mistakenly diagnosed as the &quot;doby itch,&quot; a form of contact dermatitis 

that could cause legs to swell &quot;and large knots and tumors [to] cover them until 

walking [became] extremely painful.&quot; The most effective remedy against this 

condition proved to be having all clothes boiled during laundering. Doctors also 

encountered contagious pemphigus in a potentially fatal form most often found in 

the Philippines and characterized by blisters in the groin and armpits. It was 

apparently first encountered in troops en route to the Philippines when their 

ship stopped at Guam. When sodium hyposulfite became available, doctors were 

successful in curing most of these patients.<sup>46</sup></p>

<p>Mental illness was also encountered in the Philippines, but the rate of 

psychoses was not high. Most often seen were cases diagnosed as &quot;nostalgia,&quot; or 

homesickness, an understandable and predictable problem for young men far from 

home in a strange country with a difficult climate and a hostile population. 

This problem disappeared with arrival back in the United States, but it was 

considered by some to be &quot;undoubtedly the most severe affection in the command, 

affecting officers as well as enlisted men. Some regimental medical officers are 

badly infected with this com-</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>219
  
</p>


<p>plaint, and such naturally sympathize with the men. The result is a sick list 

wholly out of proportion to the real disease present.&quot; Some soldiers also 

apparently took up smoking opium while in the Philippines, although reports that 

many became addicted were disputed.<sup>47</sup></p>

<p>Improved hygiene and sanitation were high among the measures favored in the 

effort to prevent many ills that afflicted men in the tropics. The debate over 

the virtues of woolen versus cotton underclothing in hot climates continued, 

and, in particular, the value of the woolen abdominal bandage in preventing 

diarrhea caused much argument. There was no disagreement over the need for 

lightweight uniforms. Such clothing was not available to the first arrivals in 

the Philippines, and the khaki cloth that was being issued by the 

Quartermaster's Department by the spring of 1900 was regarded as too heavy. 

Lippincott also urged in his 31 March 1899 report that the Army issue a &quot;light, 

broadbrimmed, khaki-covered helmet,&quot; in addition to the campaign hat, which was 

highly regarded for wear in the rainy season. Even the troops' shoes failed them 

in the Philippines, where &quot;the extremely plastic, adhesive mud&quot; ripped soles 

apart, making both marching and resupply difficult. On one occasion 230 of 240 

men in a battalion were without shoes. By July 1901 the official uniform for 

those serving in the Philippines was the khaki blouse and trousers, with the 

choice of underwear being left up to the individual.<sup>48</sup></p>

<p>While medical officers debated the nature of the most appropriate clothing, 

they were agreed on the management of sanitation. Failures to maintain standards 

usually resulted either from overconfidence that led to neglect or from 

battlefield necessity, since local water sources often proved to be polluted. 

Much emphasis was placed upon the need to boil all water, even when it had been 

filtered. For the most part, earth closets continued to be the usual means of 

dealing with excreta, great care being taken in maintaining latrines and in 

disposing of their contents in a sanitary manner.<sup>49</sup></p>

<p><i>Supply and Diet</i></p></center>

<p>In general, most supply shortages were temporary, and Army hospitals located 

on navigable waters or along the rail line rarely experienced problems, although 

the insurgents sometimes destroyed sections of track. Quinine was hard to find 

for a few weeks in early 1900, possibly because doctors were also treating sick 

Filipinos in the communities near their posts. Some temporary local shortages 

inevitably resulted from the inability of physicians to anticipate their needs 

well in advance, especially at the front. Investigation in one instance revealed 

that while hospitals were complaining of shortages, large supplies of many 

needed items had accumulated in Manila warehouses, presumably because of 

transportation problems. Delivering supplies became impossible when water levels 

fell and supply boats could no longer get through to troops serving along many 

rivers. When heavy rains washed out bridges, moving supplies by land became 

particularly difficult. In the rainy season in those areas where wheeled 

vehicles could not go, surgeons learned to accumulate supplies as much as six 

months ahead of the time they were needed to avoid shortages. At least one 

surgeon found himself for a time forced to rely upon &quot;native leaves and roots 

for medicines,&quot; and soldiers fighting in the jungle occasionally had to exist on 

half rations.<sup>50</sup></p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>220
  
</p>


<p>For a time in the summer of 1900, a misunderstanding developed concerning 

orders for supplies from the Philippines. The desire to respond to pleas for 

help from indigent Filipinos may have been behind what both the Medical and War 

Departments regarded as excessive demands. Surgeon General Sternberg threatened 

to halve Colonel Greenleaf's quarterly requisition for medical supplies and 

hospital stores, but General MacArthur strongly supported his chief surgeon's 

insistence upon the reasonableness of his orders, thereby apparently preventing 

any severe cutbacks.<sup>51</sup></p>

<p>Problems with diet often resulted from difficulties with supply, although 

surgeons continued to debate the ideal amount of meat and fat in the tropical 

diet. Many authorities believed that a higher proportion of sugar would be 

advisable because of the energy it provided and that the usual allowance of meat 

and fat, basically intended for men serving in cold climates, was larger than 

was necessary in the tropics. Some concluded that to maintain health in the 

tropics the soldier must eat much less than he would in a cooler climate to 

avoid producing too much heat. Others disagreed strongly, saying that the U.S. 

soldier was a meat eater, that in the tropics he needed to eat more than ever, 

and that the problem of heat should be managed by increasing the ability to lose 

heat through wearing lighter clothing.<sup>52</sup></p>

<p>Time made it apparent that the ration found acceptable in the United States 

would be satisfactory in the Philippines, but delivering meat, vegetables, and 

fruits unspoiled to the soldier in the field was at times &quot;totally out of the 

question,&quot; according to one surgeon. Meat and even hard bread deteriorated 

rapidly in the climate of the tropics. Canned meat went &quot;soft and disgusting&quot; in 

the heat, and canned vegetables weighed too much to be carried far, although 

frozen beef could be sent fifty miles inland before it thawed out. Troops at the 

front, unable to carry adequate supplies with them without the use of wheeled 

vehicles, suffered from a shortage of food.<sup>53</sup></p>

<p><i>The China Relief Expedition</i></p></center>

<p>In late June 1900, despite misgivings about weakening his force in the 

Philippines, General MacArthur ordered the 9th Infantry to prepare to embark for 

China as the first Army contingent of the China Relief Expedition, which sought 

to protect U.S. interests and citizens threatened by the Boxer Rebellion. With 

the later addition of the 14th Infantry and an artillery battalion from the 

Philippines, as well as still more units coming directly from the United States, 

the China Relief Expedition would eventually number 2,500 and include 800 

marines with their Navy doctors. Adna R. Chaffee, who received his promotion to 

major general in the volunteers on 19 July, assumed command of the China Relief 

Expedition when he arrived in China on the thirtieth, three weeks after the 

landing of the first U.S. troops there. The expedition became part of an 

international force composed of troops from several major powers, including 

Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany, and Japan, that were seeking to subdue 

the Boxers, to intimidate the Dowager Empress, and to make China again safe for 

foreigners. Because most of the U.S. soldiers who eventually served in China 

were sent from the Philippines, the responsibility for the medical care of the 

expedition fell upon the shoulders of Army Medical Department leaders 

there.<sup>54</sup></p>

<p>U.S. Volunteer surgeon Maj. William B. Banister, assigned to the 9th 

Infantry, served</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />

<p><a 

href="pic56.jpg" target="_blank">WILLIAM B. BANISTER</a></p></center>

<p>as chief surgeon of the China Relief Expedition from the date of its 

formation until 25 September 1900 and assumed the ultimate responsibility for 

the medical care of U.S. troops going to China, although Navy surgeons serving 

under him did not submit reports to the Army Medical Department. Two contract 

surgeons were detailed to assist Banister in his preparations, but one did not 

report until 25 June, the day before embarkation, and the second never 

materialized. Thus the chief surgeon had to prepare for the expedition with 

little assistance, and only four medical officers, including regimental 

surgeons, initially accompanied the first 1,300 men to sail for China. Under 

these physicians served a hospital steward, three acting hospital stewards, and 

sixteen Hospital Corps privates, but the steward and four of the privates also 

arrived only the day before embarkation.<sup>55</sup></p>

<p>The men of the 9th Infantry were already worn down by eighteen months of 

service in the Philippines. Since many were suffering from malaria and chronic 

dysentery, Major Banister concluded that the regiment was &quot;in extremely bad 

condition for field service.&quot; Nevertheless, some were so eager for service in 

China that they did their best to conceal any ailment that might prevent their 

going.<sup>56</sup></p>

<p>Although U.S. troops in China did not encounter humid and tangled jungles, 

they did face hot summers and familiar diseases presenting familiar threats. 

Hoping to reduce the incidence of malaria to a minimum, Major Banister prepared 

for the landing by dosing each man with a daily gram of quinine for three days 

before he set foot for the first time on Chinese soil. The traditional 

filth-borne diseases, too, again threatened U.S. troops. In Chinese communities, 

instead of a sewage system, &quot;the pail system [was] generally in vogue,&quot; but 

because night soil was highly regarded as fertilizer for crops, it was piled up 

at selected sites outside the city, awaiting &quot;its ultimate transportation to the 

country.&quot; The towns were in an &quot;indescribably filthy condition&quot; because of poor 

drainage and the tendency of the poorer male members of the population to 

relieve themselves wherever they were. Despite efforts to have soldiers drink 

only water known to be safe, dysentery took a high toll, and typhoid rates were 

higher than they had been in the Philippines.<sup>57</sup></p>

<p>After arriving near Tientsin on 10 and 11 July, Army and Navy physicians 

worked together to unload their equipment and set up an operating room in the 

building they shared outside the city. Major Banister assigned an acting 

hospital steward and four privates to each of the two battalions that landed in 

time to take part in the first battle of the Boxer Rebellion, the Battle of 

Tientsin on 13 July. The multinational</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>222
  
</p>


<p>force was rapidly successful in taking the city. Of the wounded, 77 were U.S. 

soldiers, some of whom received their initial care in ditches, where the 

polluted water soaked their injuries and caused a particularly high rate of 

infection among those with shrapnel wounds. Since none of the Army's ambulance 

wagons had yet arrived before the city, the casualties were evacuated by 

litter-bearers who were forced from time to time to put down their burdens to 

return fire. Banister himself went into the city with the most advanced units, 

and the two hospital corpsmen with him never left his side. Supplies were 

brought up to him after he had set up an aid station behind the city's inner 

wall. As soon as the enemy left the city, Banister and his Navy colleagues 

entered to set up their facilities. Some Army patients shared the Marine 

hospital, and Banister took over a hotel for the remainder. By midnight every 

wounded man had received care and been moved into a bed within the newly 

surrendered city.<sup>58</sup></p>

<p>The interservice cooperation among U.S. units continued long after the battle 

had been won. With his sick and wounded divided among three locations, the 

regiment, the Marine hospital, and the hotel, Banister's hospital attendants 

were spread so thin that he was forced to supplement them with details from the 

line. He was soon able to concentrate his resources by moving all his patients 

from the Marine hospital, although the Army facility continued to receive 

occasional Marine casualties. After a few days Banister began to evacuate 

patients to the Navy hospital ship <i>Solace</i>; by 24 July she was sheltering 

64 Army patients. She then departed for the United States via Japan, where the 

Japanese had made hospital space available at several cities, including 500 beds 

at Nagasaki.<sup>59</sup></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, given the condition of the troops when they were sent to 

China, the number of ill among them grew as the summer continued. By 26 July 215 

men were sick with their units and another 61 were ill on board a transport, 

most of them with diarrhea and dysentery. Major Banister decided to establish a 

base hospital in a private home surrounded by enough land to permit pitching 

tents. Here the wounded could also recuperate until the expected arrival of the 

<i>Relief</i>, then on her way to China, and supplies could be accumulated for 

the advance on Peking. By this point, more supplies, equipment, and personnel 

were coming in to Tientsin. Four acting hospital stewards and thirty-two 

Hospital Corps privates were sent to the Tientsin hotel. The arrival of six more 

physicians made it possible to assign three to the base hospital. The eleven 

female nurses who had volunteered for China service while en route to Manila 

arrived in early August. Five more and a professional male nurse, plus more 

contract surgeons, disembarked a short while later.<sup>60</sup></p>

<p>A few days after General Chaffee took command of the China Relief Expedition, 

2,500 U.S. soldiers joined British and French troops to march on Peking. The 

U.S. contingent now included the 14th Infantry with its four regular medical 

officers, two contract surgeons, twenty-one hospital corpsmen, and equipment. 

Each regiment had &quot;Chino&quot; litter-bearers, but they were trusted so little that 

they were kept &quot;under guard to prevent their running away.&quot; A Regular Army 

assistant surgeon also accompanied the artillery battalion that was a part of 

the expedition. Marching with the soldiers were U.S. Marines with their three 

physicians, attendants, and litter-bearers. Although supply wagons were 

available for the Medical Department, Major Banister,</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />



<p>223
  
</p>


<p>who continued in the position of chief surgeon, had his medical chests 

carried in his ambulances so that they would be immediately 

available.<sup>61</sup></p>

<p>Shortly after leaving for Tientsin, the expedition encountered the enemy at 

Yangtsun, suffering an estimated 61 casualties in the engagement that followed. 

The ambulances moved forward just behind the troops, out of the line of fire, 

and picked up the wounded, taking them to the dressing station and then moving 

them forward to the campsite chosen for the night. Except for a surgeon who 

remained with the ambulances, all physicians stayed with the troops. A junk took 

11 of the wounded back to the Tientsin base hospital that evening, with the rest 

of the wounded and several sick men making the same trip the next day. When the 

troops resumed their march, the heat took a heavy toll. Heatstroke and even 

convulsions were common, and ambulances were filled to overflowing. Fortunately, 

since it was impossible to keep all the disabled with the expedition as it moved 

forward, the number of surgeons with the troops was large enough to permit one 

to be left behind with the sick at each campsite.<sup>62</sup></p>

<p>The pattern set at Tientsin was generally followed at Peking. A multinational 

force handled the attack, which began with an unsuccessful Russian assault on 13 

August. On the fourteenth U.S. troops scaled the wall around the Outer City and 

provided cover for the British soldiers who followed them. The next day U.S. 

artillery destroyed the gates in the wall around the Inner City, opening the way 

to the occupation of the entire city. American doctors with the attacking force 

provided medical care at Peking as they had in Tientsin, setting up a 150-bed 

field hospital as soon as the city fell. Here the sick and the 30 wounded 

received excellent care until they were evacuated by water back to the Tientsin 

base hospital. Whenever possible, the wounded and the seriously ill were then 

placed on the <i>Relief </i>for evacuation to Nagasaki, which became a 

second-level base for the expedition. On 29 September a second Army hospital 

ship, the <i>Maine</i>, was assigned the responsibility for taking patients to 

Nagasaki, where the <i>Relief </i>was to pick them up for the trip to Manila, 

which remained the primary base for American forces fighting in 

China.<sup>63</sup></p>

<p>The Peking hospital initially lacked an adequate supply of standard hospital 

bedding and furniture, but surgeons found Chinese bedding satisfactory on a 

temporary basis. In the fall a permanent hospital of 85 beds was established for 

the brigade to be garrisoned at Peking; existing Chinese buildings were used 

because the arrival of cold weather allowed no time for new construction. Some 

modifications were deemed necessary in these buildings, including lowering high 

ceilings and replacing many paper-covered lattice-work windows and doors with 

glass. For a few months a second and smaller hospital was set up at Peking, 

together with a residence for the female nurses who worked at the larger 

hospital.<sup>64</sup></p>

<p>By the end of September 1900 almost 4,000 soldiers were serving in China. A 

second brigade was stationed at Tientsin, where, like the garrison at Peking, it 

was served by a large hospital in the city. Many detachments were serving at 

other locations, and two of them had their own small hospitals. Since the 

railroad from Peking to Tientsin was still not operative, supplies had to be 

moved by river, and because junks covered no more than twenty miles a day, 

garrisons also had to be stationed along the waterway until December, when the 

railroad was at last reopened. For troops thus scat-</p>

</p>


<p>tered about a land of almost nonexistent sanitation, typhoid remained a 

particular danger, even when the greatest of care was taken, since flies could 

carry the disease to food and water supplies that were otherwise safe. 

Fortunately for their health, many of the U.S. troops occupying China left in 

the spring of 1901, and many of the remaining men left the following autumn. By 

1904 the only Army troops in China were the men of the company guarding the 

embassy at Peking, and the rates of typhoid, malaria, tuberculosis, venereal 

disease, and alcoholism among them were higher than those among men stationed in 

the United States.<sup>65</sup></p>

<p>Service with the multinational force enabled medical officers to compare 

their work and equipment with that of the world's major military powers. Major 

Ives, who succeeded Major Banister in September 1900, commented unfavorably upon 

the transportation available to U.S. medical officers, blaming the situation 

largely upon the Medical Department's dependence on the Quartermaster's 

Department and the slow response time that resulted. He admired the Japanese 

litter as particularly well suited to battlefield use, though by no means as 

sturdy and comfortable as the American model. He was particularly enthusiastic 

about the disinfecting plants and laboratories of the German hospitals, but his 

observations led him to conclude that &quot;the medical department of the United 

States Army is the best and most intelligently equipped of any service there 

represented.&quot;<sup>66</sup></p>

<p>Although U.S. forces encountered astoundingly unsanitary conditions both in 

China and in the Philippines, the two campaigns were otherwise a study in 

contrasts. The refusal of the Filipinos to accept American occupation resulted 

in a prolonged guerrilla war that challenged medical officers to adjust to the 

demands of innumerable small-unit operations, most of which were conducted in a 

hostile environment, and at times to work in comparative isolation. The Boxer 

Rebellion, on the other hand, involved conventional warfare and required U.S. 

physicians to work in proximity with medical officers of other nations in a 

situation where they could observe firsthand the way in which the medical 

services of other nations functioned. The campaigns over, physicians with both 

occupation forces were swept up in the effort to prevent the destruction of U.S. 

garrisons by disease.</p>

<p>Like the Spanish-American War, the Philippine Insurrection and the Boxer 

Rebellion reacquainted the U.S. Army with the potentially devastating effects of 

disease upon the effectiveness of armed forces and also placed U.S. troops in 

the midst of disease-ridden civilian populations living under conditions of 

incredibly poor sanitation. Unlike the Filipinos and the Chinese, who, U.S. 

observers believed, had accepted widespread disease and the deaths that resulted 

as inevitable, Army physicians were convinced by what they already knew that 

high morbidity and mortality rates were preventable. This conviction gave added 

strength to their struggles to guarantee the benefits of modern medicine to 

American soldiers and also to the people of the lands they 

occupied.<sup>67</sup></p>
