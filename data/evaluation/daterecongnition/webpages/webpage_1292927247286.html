	<h3 class="title">Why the US Should not have an Arms Race with China</h3>
	
	<p> I'm running out of enemies, Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, famously said after the end of the Cold War: I'm down to Kim Il Sung and Fidel Castro. They were evil enough, but weren't much of a military threat to America. George W. Bush and his neocon coterie have sought to turn Islamic terrorists into the equivalent of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, but few people other than GOP activists take that comparison seriously.</p>

<p>In fact, America remains a military colossus. The Bush administration has proposed spending $515 billion next year on the military; more, adjusted for inflation, than at any time since World War II. The U.S. accounts for roughly half of the world's military outlays.</p>

<p>Washington is allied with every major industrialized state except China and Russia. America's avowed enemies are a pitiful few: Burma, Cuba, Syria, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea. The U.S. government could destroy every one of these states with a flick of the president's wrist.</p>

<p>Russia has become rather contentious of late, but that hardly makes it an enemy. Moreover, the idea that Moscow could rearm, reconquer the nations that once were part of the Soviet Union or communist satellites, overrun Western Europe, and then attack the U.S. � without anyone in America noticing the threat along the way � is, well, a paranoid fantasy more extreme than the usual science fiction plot. The Leninist Humpty-Dumpty has fallen off the wall and even a bunch of former KGB agents aren't going to be able to put him back together.</p>

<p>Which leaves the People's Republic of China. Beijing, like Russia, should not be considered an enemy. However, it has the makings of a great power, even a superpower, which could ultimately face America as a peer. Moreover, with its influence rising in a region that the U.S. government has grown used to dominating, there is real potential for future conflict.</p>

<p>That potential makes the PRC the best excuse for Washington to spend ever more on the U.S. military.</p>

	<h3 class="title">ACLU Sues Boeing Subsidiary over Rendition Flights</h3>
	
	<p>Last week, in the relatively liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a scathing indictment of both the Boeing subsidiary that milked the rendition flights for all they were worth, and the Bush administration's neurotic attempts to cloak even private litigants behind the state secrets doctrine.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The new case, Muhamed v. Jeppesen, takes aim at a subsidiary of American defense contractor Boeing that appears to have cornered the market on CIA rendition flights, and profited handsomely thereby. The filings even include a declaration by a former Jeppesen employee, who recounts the story of a senior manager reveling in how profitable the rendition racket was at an employee meet-and-greet in San Jose, only to have to explain to the confused new employees that he was talking about the "torture flights".</p>

	<p>After the United States has spent more than $5 billion in a largely failed effort to bolster the Pakistani military effort against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, some American officials now acknowledge that there were too few controls over the money. The strategy to improve the Pakistani military, they said, needs to be completely revamped.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Telecoms Seek Immunity for Helping Feds Spy</h3>
	
	<p>For months, the Bush administration has waged a high-profile campaign, including personal lobbying by President Bush and closed-door briefings by top officials, to persuade Congress to pass legislation protecting companies from lawsuits for aiding the National Security Agency�s warrantless eavesdropping program.</p>

<p>But the battle is really about something much bigger. At stake is the federal government�s extensive but uneasy partnership with industry to conduct a wide range of secret surveillance operations in fighting terrorism and crime.</p>

<p>The N.S.A.�s reliance on telecommunications companies is broader and deeper than ever before, according to government and industry officials, yet that alliance is strained by legal worries and the fear of public exposure.</p>

	<h3 class="title">White House Censoring Climate Debate</h3>
	
	<p><i>Thank god we live in America, where we have a free press that allows us to found policy debates on reliable information, and the government does not exert undue influence on the will of the public.  AG</i></p>

<p>For the past 16 months, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been investigating allegations of political interference with government climate change science under the Bush Administration. During the course of this investigation, the Committee obtained over 27,000 pages of documents from the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Commerce Department, held two investigative hearings, and deposed or interviewed key officials. Much of the information made available to the Committee has never been publicly disclosed.</p>

<p>This report presents the findings of the Committee's investigation. The evidence before the Committee leads to one inescapable conclusion: the Bush Administration has engaged in a systematic effort to manipulate climate change science and mislead policymakers and the public about the dangers of global warming.</p>

<p>In 1998, the American Petroleum Institute developed an internal "Communications Action Plan" that stated: "Victory will be achieved when � average citizens �understand' uncertainties in climate science � [and] recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the �conventional wisdom.'" The Bush Administration has acted as if the oil industry's communications plan were its mission statement. White House officials and political appointees in the agencies censored congressional testimony on the causes and impacts of global warming, controlled media access to government climate scientists, and edited federal scientific reports to inject unwarranted uncertainty into discussions of climate change and to minimize the threat to the environment and the economy.</p>

	<p><i>One commentator on this article pointed out that "the tropics" are defined for purposes of astronomy as "the limits of where the sun can be observed directly overhead at noon;" which doesn't take anything away from the point of the article, which is that the climate formerly associated with the astronomical tropics is now associated only with the... climatological tropics.  AG</i></p>

<p>The tropics have moved hundreds of miles towards the poles in less than 30 years because of global warming, researchers have concluded.</p>

<p>The expansion of tropics northwards and southwards threatens to have profound repercussions on the world�s weather systems as jet streams and storm tracks are bumped out of position. Research into the impact of global warming on the tropics suggests that they may have moved 500 miles (805km) or more in each direction and much faster than anticipated.</p>

	<p><i>I do not suggest that you take this (or anything I post here) at face value.  However, it is interesting to indulge this particular line of speculation.  AG</i></p>

<p>Pakistan�s nuclear assets remain vulnerable for a number of reasons. One important feature of its nuclear infrastructure is that much of it has been deployed to the west of the country to extend the warning time in the event of possible Indian attacks against the infrastructure and to delay an overrun from the ground. as an unintended consequence of this position, much of Pakistan�s nuclear infrastructure is located close to the volatile region to the west and north-west of Islamabad.</p>

	<h3 class="title">An Educated Opinion on Pakistan</h3>
	
	<p>The real motivation for Musharraf's declared emergency is not to defend the country against "Islamic extremists," as he claims, but to maintain Musharraf in power. He acted to prevent public protests that lawyers and political parties were organizing. And his scheme is working. Musharraf's new brand-new, hand-picked Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Musharraf can remain in power for five more years.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The recipient of nearly $11 billion of U.S. aid since 9/11, Musharraf will cover for his benefactor Bush to keep him from losing face in light of the Pakistani strongman's blatant and tyrannical power grab. Musharraf has agreed that parliamentary elections scheduled for January will proceed and that he will take off his military uniform after the sham elections are held. Of course, Musharraf's jailed political opponents will likely find it difficult to campaign effectively for seats in parliament while incarcerated under a state of martial law.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Bush claims that Musharraf is an indispensable ally in his "war against terror," and that money sent to Pakistan supports that goal. It appears from my vantage point, though, that Musharraf is playing Bush for a fool. Musharraf tells Bush he will help destroy the Taliban. However, Pakistani Professor Pervez Hoodbhoy wrote in the November 18 Los Angeles Times that some people in Pakistan believe Musharraf is "secretly supporting the Taliban as a means for countering Indian influence." Moreover, if Musharraf wants to regain and maintain support of the Pakistani people, he will continue to support the Taliban. Hoodbhoy also wrote, "Most Pakistanis see the [Taliban] as America 's enemy, not their own. The Taliban is perceived as the only group standing up against the unwelcome American presence in the region." According to Hoodbhoy, "For more than 25 years, the army has nurtured Islamist radicals as proxy warriors for covert operations on Pakistan 's borders in Kashmir and Afghanistan ."</p>

	<h3 class="title">WSJ (Online) Tackles Peak Oil</h3>
	
	<p>A growing number of oil-industry chieftains are endorsing an idea long deemed fringe: The world is approaching a practical limit to the number of barrels of crude oil that can be pumped every day.</p>

<p>Some predict that, despite the world's fast-growing thirst for oil, producers could hit that ceiling as soon as 2012. This rough limit -- which two senior industry officials recently pegged at about 100 million barrels a day -- is well short of global demand projections over the next few decades. Current production is about 85 million barrels a day.</p>

<p>The world certainly won't run out of oil any time soon. And plenty of energy experts expect sky-high prices to hasten the development of alternative fuels and improve energy efficiency. But evidence is mounting that crude-oil production may plateau before those innovations arrive on a large scale. That could set the stage for a period marked by energy shortages, high prices and bare-knuckled competition for fuel.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Preparing for Life After Oil</h3>
	
	<p>This past May, in an unheralded and almost unnoticed move, the Energy Department signaled a fundamental, near epochal shift in US and indeed world history: we are nearing the end of the Petroleum Age and have entered the Age of Insufficiency. The department stopped talking about "oil" in its projections of future petroleum availability and began speaking of "liquids." The global output of "liquids," the department indicated, would rise from 84 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe) per day in 2005 to a projected 117.7 mboe in 2030 -- barely enough to satisfy anticipated world demand of 117.6 mboe. Aside from suggesting the degree to which oil companies have ceased being mere suppliers of petroleum and are now purveyors of a wide variety of liquid products -- including synthetic fuels derived from natural gas, corn, coal and other substances -- this change hints at something more fundamental: we have entered a new era of intensified energy competition and growing reliance on the use of force to protect overseas sources of petroleum.</p>

	<p>The views of the oil industry on Peak Oil are divided, ranging from a non-event to getting there fast. Here I try to give the opinions of oil company executives about Peak Oil and related issues. The list is certainly not complete. For example, I omitted opinions expressed by the executives after they are retired. After each quote I list the name of the executive, his position at the time and the link (where possible) to the original source. At the end of the article I make some remarks.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>�The growth rate of supplies of �easy oil�, conventional oil and natural gas that are relatively easy to extract, will struggle to keep up with accelerating demand. Just when energy demand is surging, many of the world�s conventional oilfields are going into decline. The problem is not the availability of resources as such�..For every barrel of oil or cubic meter of gas that you consume today, to replace that barrel it costs more, so our industry gets a lot more capital intensive per unit all the time." - Jeroen van der Veer, CEO, Royal Dutch Shell. 25 June 2007.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Venezuela Impounds US Diplomatic Shipment</h3>
	
	<p>Venezuela sent a diplomatic protest note to the United States as part of a continuing spat over some diplomatic cargo, Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said on Monday, in a further sign of tension between Washington and Caracas.</p>

<p>The U.S. Embassy in Caracas last week said Venezuela had illegally impounded 20 packages that the United States said were protected by diplomatic immunity.</p>

<p>But Venezuela said 16 of the 20 packages did not have diplomatic privilege and described them as "contraband" that included military equipment.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>A U.S. Embassy official last week denied that military goods were part of the embassy delivery, but said some U.S.-made aircraft equipment that Venezuela had purchased was on the same plane that delivered the embassy cargo.</p>

<p>A State Department spokesman last week said "the impounded cargo consisted of household effects of a U.S. diplomat and a shipment of commissary goods."</p>

	<h3 class="title">Code Targets AMD Processors</h3>
	
	<p>Symantec has discovered a proof of concept virus that targets AMD processors rather than operating systems.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the worm, one aims at 32-bit and the other at 64-bit AMD processors. Symantec has called them "virus w32.bounds" and "w64.bounds". </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Symantec figures that the next stage would be to mix the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the malware to create a single virus that can target both Intel and AMD families. The technique probably would not be used as a mass attack, but could be quite good as a targeted take-down method, Symantec says.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>There has not been a good chip level threat since 1998 when the CIH/Chernobyl worm embedded itself into the flash-BIOS of several million computers and destroyed data.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Venezuela to Drop US Anti-Drug Deal</h3>
	
	<p>The appointment of a top U.S. intelligence official specifically for Cuba and Venezuela prompted the South American country to say Monday that it will reconsider signing a counter-drug deal with Washington.</p>

<p>The Bush administration announced Friday it would appoint a "mission manager" for the two countries, putting them on equal footing with North Korea and Iran as the only countries with such managers, charged with developing strategies for key hot spots.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Criticism of Cera</h3>
	
	<p>At a moment when a tank full of gasoline costs $75, the Chinese are eagerly trading bicycles for cars, and Americans are consuming their body weight in petroleum each week, it would be nice to know how much oil will be readily available a decade from now. In a thirsty world, will supply be adequate to satisfy demand?</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>For the past decade, CERA, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the Paris-based International Energy Agency have produced important forecasts whose predictions would be comic if they hadn�t been so tragically misleading. In an effort to reassure politicians, these groups have become purveyors of petro-prozac.</p>

<p>In 1998, the IEA, struggling to balance its forecasts of future demand with supply, created a mysterious new category of �unidentified unconventional� oil which would supposedly provide 19 million barrels a day by 2020. When independent analysts ridiculed this fudge factor, the agency deleted the category, but continued to insist that the 11 OPEC nations could double supply, a geopolitical improbability and a geological impossibility, since production in half of them has already peaked.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>What's going on here, how can so many bright people get it so wrong?</p>

<p>In the EIA�s case, it turns out that the computer model it used to forecast natural gas supplies lacked serious resource constraints. CERA, too, seems to have difficulty grasping the havoc that declines in production are wreaking on aging oil fields. Petroleum engineers are intimately familiar with depletion; it�s what keeps them awake at night. But depletion is inexhaustible; it�s an implacable foe that never sleeps, yet grows stronger each day. Even if CERA�s forecasted 21 million barrels a day of new supply were to appear, world oil supplies might grow only a bit or perhaps not at all due to depletion in existing fields.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>At peak, the world will not be �running out.� Indeed, more than half the world�s conventional oil and a larger share of its unconventional oil will remain to be extracted. . What the world is running out of is cheap oil, the $20 oil we built our civilization around. Suggesting that there are no insurmountable problems for the oil industry above or below ground and that a return to inexpensive oil and orderly oil markets is in the cards is a fool�s forecast. Taking such Pollyannish scenarios at face value threatens economic prosperity and national security.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>What are the real facts? Today, twenty nations produce 85% of the world�s oil, and production in half of these nations has already peaked, as it did in the United States 35 years ago. Despite new production in places like Angola, Kazakhstan and Brazil, two thirds of the world�s remaining conventional oil is in the tinderbox of the Middle East. Oil is becoming more difficult to find; 2005 was the worst exploration year since World War II.</p>

	<h3 class="title">BBC scrapes the barrel to stand up peak oil theory</h3>
	
	<p>As part of its �Climate Chaos� season looking at global environmental problems, last Tuesday BBC2 aired a documentary titled �If � the oil runs out�</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>In the film, industry consultant Paul Domjan correctly points out that drilling in Alaska can only make a small contribution. But just north of John and Janie�s home in Minnesota is the Canadian province of Alberta, home to vast deposits of oil sands, grit mixed with oil. These are more difficult and costly to refine than conventional liquid crude. However, already in 2002, 178bn barrels of reserves from oil sands were added to Canada�s reserves, leaving them second only to Saudi Arabia�s.</p>

<p>In April, Venezuela announced that it was adding a significant chunk of its heavy oil � another largely untapped source that remained unexploited until relatively recently� to its reserves. These will allow its reserves to surpass those of Saudi Arabia, with enough oil to maintain its current production for another two centuries. Heavy oil already accounts for roughly a quarter of its output.</p>

<p>Support for this geological pessimism is not widespread. Industry consultant and author of �The Prize�, Daniel Yergin is dismissive: �This is the fifth time we�ve run out of oil since the 1880s�. Vaclav Smil, an energy historian, points out that �peak oil� forecasters have a long history of unsuccessful forecasts. In 1979 both BP and the CIA pointed to 1985 as the turning point and in 1990, the UN suggested the coming decade would see the peaking of global oil production. </p>

	<h3 class="title">Peak Oil: the Opposing View</h3>
	
	<p>From Wall Street to Main Street, concerns over the phenomenon known as "peak oil" have reached a fever pitch. "Peak oil", of course, is the hypothesis that global crude-oil production has peaked, or will soon, and is destined to start a permanent decline thereafter - with frightful consequences, it is usually argued, for Industrial Civilization as We Know It.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are still some laggards who are not sufficiently impressed with the self-evident truth of this theory to be spurred into dramatic action. Consequently, a leading energy expert has slammed the skeptics and, at the same time, elevated the status of the true believers.</p>

<p>Although energy is mainly a secular matter, the expert writes: "This is a question of almost religious importance which needs the study and determination of every intelligent person." His key message is: "It is the material energy - the universal aid - the factor in everything we do. With petroleum almost any feat is possible or easy; without it we are thrown into the laborious poverty of early times."</p>

<p>Straight from today's editorial pages, except for two minor details: these quotations have been provided without a date, and with one key word changed.</p>

<p>The date was 1865; the important energy source was coal, not petroleum; and the writer was Stanley Jevons - a leading economist. His book, The Coal Question, was thoroughly researched and broadcast his personal concerns that the industrialized world was about to run out of coal and civilization would therefore collapse.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Hayden Confirmed (More or Less)</h3>
	
	<p>The Senate Intelligence Committee strongly endorsed Gen. Michael V. Hayden on Tuesday to be the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency, with all but three members, all Democrats, voting to send General Hayden's nomination to the Senate floor.</p>

<p>The panel's 12-to-3 vote virtually guarantees that General Hayden will win confirmation by the full Senate, which is likely to vote on his selection before the end of the week.</p>

<p>With the current C.I.A. director, Porter J. Goss, planning to leave the agency on Friday, the White House had urged the Senate to move quickly on General Hayden's confirmation. The vote on Tuesday came just 15 days after President Bush nominated General Hayden.</p>

<p>Four committee Democrats joined all eight Republican members in endorsing the general. Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas and the panel's chairman, called General Hayden "a proven leader and a supremely qualified intelligence professional."</p>

<p>The committee's vice chairman, John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, said General Hayden had shown "the necessary independence that is essential to restoring the C.I.A.'s credibility and stature."</p>

<p>The Democrats who voted against the nomination were Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Evan Bayh of Indiana. Each cited concerns about General Hayden's role in a controversial domestic surveillance program he ran while head of the National Security Agency.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Fannie Mae Settles w/ OFHEO</h3>
	
	<p>Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage buyer, is expected to pay more than $400 million today as part of a settlement to resolve claims that executives manipulated earnings in the 1990's so they could receive bigger bonuses, two people briefed on the situation said yesterday.</p>

<p>A government official confirmed Fannie Mae's settlement with the Office of Federal Housing and Enterprise Oversight, the company's chief safety and soundness regulator and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees its books. Neither person would agree to be identified because the settlement had not been formally announced.</p>

<p>Officials from Fannie Mae, Ofheo and the S.E.C. declined to comment last night. An announcement of the settlement is expected at a news conference this afternoon.</p>

<p>The settlement comes as Ofheo publicly releases a comprehensive and potentially damaging report that is expected to level scathing criticism at Fannie Mae's accounting practices and management culture.</p>

	<p>By a wide margin, an honest cross-section of communities in a Midwestern "battleground" state--where Bush and Kerry wrestled to a virtual tie in 2004, and where the House delegation is split between four Democrats and four Republicans--have told Washington that it is time to bring the troops home.</p>

	<p><i>Sometimes you really can't make these things up.</i></p>

<p>A real estate developer charged with stealing millions of dollars was found stabbed to death Monday in the basement of his Greenwich mansion.</p>

<p>Police said the victim, Andrew Kissel, 46, was found lying in a pool of blood, his hands and feet bound.</p>

<p>Kissel had criminal cases pending in federal and state courts in New York. The federal case charged him with real estate fraud, and state prosecutors charged him with grand larceny, alleging he stole nearly $4 million from his Manhattan apartment cooperative.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Kissel was the brother of Robert Kissel, a wealthy banker whose wife, Nancy, was convicted of murdering her husband in Hong Kong in 2003 after feeding him a milkshake laced with drugs and then beating him to death.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>William Kissel, the father of the two slain men, told the Times: "I haven't read the book of Job yet, but I'm about to." </p>

	<h3 class="title">Bush & Fox Meet on Immigration</h3>
	
	<p>President Bush arrived here on Wednesday evening for a summit meeting that was intended in part to allay this country's concerns that he will not have sufficient political capital to push through broad-ranging changes in American immigration policy.</p>

<p>The meeting is a long-scheduled North American summit meeting, for which President Vicente Fox of Mexico is the host and which Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada will also attend.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> "I believe that migration brings great benefits to the United States," Mr. Fox said in the interview. "I trust that American businessmen understand the productivity and quality of Mexican labor. And I trust that American governors recognize the enormous contributions that immigrants make to their states."</p>

<p>Mexico's prosperity depends even more heavily on immigrants in the United States. Remittances from the United States to Mexico exceeded $16 billion last year, the nation's second-highest source of revenue, after oil. Migration also serves as an escape valve that takes pressure off a government unable to create enough decent-paying jobs for its people.</p>

<p>"Mexico is an immigration addict," said Rafael Fern�ndez de Castro, an expert on United States-Mexico relations at the Technological Autonomous Institute of Mexico. "If 400,000 people were not able to migrate every year, I don't want to think about what would happen."</p>

	<p>German customs agents have raided the offices of 41 companies suspected of links to Iran's nuclear programme.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said specialised equipment worth several million euros that could have been used for a nuclear programme had been shipped to Iran via Russia.</p>

<p>The suspicious exports were traced to a Berlin firm no longer in business. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Prosecutors said seven men, mostly of Russian origin, were suspected or organising the network.</p>

<p>The men have not been arrested and their whereabouts have not been confirmed.</p>

<p>Supplying demand</p>

<p>Benedikt Welfens, a spokesman for the German prosecutors' office, told the ARD TV network that the Berlin-based company acted as a cover for a network involved in exports to Iran.</p>

<p>"Its main business is the supply of Iran's nuclear programme," Mr Welfens said.</p>

<p>"We found out that the employees of this company purposefully contacted companies in Germany in order to purchase very specific components for Iran."</p>

<p>He suggested that the goods were worth up to three million euros ($3.6m; �2m).</p>

<p>"It's not that much, but it may rise. We have to look at the information and data that we've found," he said. </p>

	<p>The Russian government collected intelligence from sources inside the American military command as the U.S. mounted the invasion of Iraq, and the Russians fed information to Saddam Hussein on troop movements and plans, according to Iraqi documents cited in a Pentagon report released Friday.</p>

<p>The Russians relayed information to Hussein during the opening days of the war in late March and early April 2003, including a crucial time before the ground assault on Baghdad, according to the documents.</p>

<p>The unclassified report does not assess the value of the information or provide details beyond citing two captured Iraqi documents that say the Russians collected information from sources "inside the American Central Command" and that battlefield intelligence was provided to Hussein through the Russian ambassador in Baghdad.</p>

	<h3 class="title">All About Gazprom</h3>
	
	<p>Last winter, the Kremlin-backed candidate in Ukraine's contested presidential election lost to Viktor A. Yushchenko, the pro-Western leader of the Orange Revolution.</p>

<p>This winter, Russia is demanding almost a fivefold increase in the price of gas supplied to Ukraine, a change widely seen as payback for Moscow's embarrassment a year ago.</p>

<p>At the center of this geopolitical game is Gazprom, Russia's natural gas monopoly, the country's largest company and the producer of a third of the world's supply of natural gas. Gazprom is a corporation aspiring to join the ranks of energy majors like Exxon Mobil and BP, with the scope and bulk to operate worldwide. It is also a powerful instrument of Russia's emerging foreign policy doctrine, which rests on energy exports - and the power and prestige they bring - in place of lost military might.</p>

<p>Gazprom, which opened its shares to foreign buyers this month, is seeking institutional investors and acceptance in Western markets to further its goals. In the conflict with Ukraine, however, Gazprom is at risk of appearing as a tool of the Kremlin - used to punish a pro-Western government in Eastern Europe - rather than as a modern company that could claim to be attractive to institutional investors.</p>

<p>Yet Gazprom's new pricing policy in Ukraine would also benefit stockholders; Gazprom could earn more than $3 billion next year by raising prices. Far from being a mere tool, some analysts see Gazprom - Russia's most important company - as a driving force in pushing the Kremlin's Ukraine policy with the intention of increasing profits from energy sales. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Gazprom accounts for 10 percent of Russia's economic activity. But it is sprawling, inefficiently managed and overstaffed, with divisions running everything from newspapers to poultry farms far outside its core business, and it is often seen as a slush fund for the Kremlin's off-the-books needs.</p>

<p>Still, Gazprom is one of the world's largest energy companies, as measured by the volume of its proven reserves. It controls more crude oil and equivalent in natural gas than Iraq. The company has rights to huge, unexplored fields in eastern Siberia; it is expected to win tax concessions next spring to develop them.</p>

<p>It is also actively opening new markets. The company is in the midst of a program to redraw the energy map of Europe by building underwater pipelines in the Black and Baltic Seas, extending the reach and scale of its sales to the West and competing with efforts by companies in the United States to sell liquefied natural gas from the Middle East in Europe.</p>

<p>In the Far East, Gazprom is promising to supply China's exploding energy needs with two gas pipelines; it has promised gas to Japan and South Korea as well. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Gazprom expects to earn $66 billion next year. But the company is capitalized at $159 billion, or roughly half that of the world's largest company by stock value, the General Electric Company, which has a market capitalization of $373 billion, according to the Reuters news agency.</p>

<p>Analysts and diplomats who follow Russian energy policy say the company will easily double in value in the next year or two, after share liberalization. </p>

	<h3 class="title">Gulf Stream Diversion?</h3>
	
	<p>The Gulf Stream currents that give Britain its mild climate have weakened dramatically, offering the first firm scientific evidence of a slowdown that threatens the country with temperatures as cold as Canada�s.</p>

<p>The Atlantic Ocean "conveyor belt" that carries warm water north from the tropics has weakened by 30 per cent in just 12 years, scientists have discovered.</p>

<p>The findings, from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, give the strongest indication yet that the Europe�s central heating system is breaking down under the impact of global warming.</p>

<p>Scientists have long predicted that melting ice caps could disrupt the currents that keep Britain at least 5C (9F) warmer than it should be, but the new research suggests that this is already underway.</p>

<p>It points to a cooling of 1C (1.8F) over the next decade or two, and an even deeper freeze could follow if the Gulf Stream system were to shut down altogether.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The results, published today in the journal Nature, show that while the outward flow of the Gulf Stream has not changed, the strength of the cold water returning from the Arctic has fallen by 30 per cent since 1992.</p>

<p>Over the same period, the flow of warm water branching off the Gulf Stream towards Africa has increased by 30 per cent. This suggests that the current�s warm waters are being diverted to the south and away from Europe, with potentially serious consequences for the continent�s climate.</p>

	<h3 class="title">US Carbon Emissions at All-Time High</h3>
	
	<p>Emissions of global warming gases from the United States have nearly doubled in 14 years and reached an all-time high in 2004, according to figures released by the American government. But new analysis suggests Europe is also falling behind in its attempt to meet legally binding United Nations targets.</p>

<p>The US energy department report shows emissions rose 2% in 2004 and stood one year ago at 7,122.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year - about 25% of the world total. The rise was the greatest in five years and is part of an accelerating trend. Revised figures also published showed emissions in 2003 were at the second highest level. This year's figures have not been published but are expected by analysts to be similar or greater because of strong US economic growth. </p>

	<h3 class="title">Potential Adverse Effects of Carbon Sequestration</h3>
	
	<p>rowing tree plantations to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mitigate global warming -- so called "carbon sequestration" -- could trigger environmental changes that outweigh some of the benefits, a multi-institutional team led by Duke University suggested in a new report. Those effects include water and nutrient depletion and increased soil salinity and acidity, said the researchers.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Russia Brings New Nukes On-line</h3>
	
	<p>VLADIMIR Putin has sparked fears of a new arms race between Russia and the United States by deploying a nuclear ballistic strike force system that officials made clear could penetrate US anti- missile defences.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, the Russian army activated a new fleet of Topol-M missiles that can fit a nuclear warhead and travel 6,000 miles, changing trajectory to foil any enemy interception device. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>General Nikolai Solovtsov, commander of the Russian missile forces, has mobilised a new battalion for the Topol-M missiles, which have a capacity for a one megatonne impact - 75 times the power of the 1945 Hiroshima bomb.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>While Russia had disbanded two missile divisions last year, it has now formed more than 20 new units - in the fastest increase of nuclear spending since the run-up to the Cuban missile crisis.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>But now the economy is flush with new oil wealth, the nuclear missile programme has been revived and was last month allocated a �1 billion budget increase from the Kremlin. This has boosted Mr Putin's popularity.</p>

	<p><i>Who's surprised? AG</i></p>

<p>Congressional officials said Saturday that they wanted to investigate the disclosure that the National Security Agency had gained access to some of the country's main telephone arteries to glean data on possible terrorists.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Current and former government officials say that the security agency, as part of its domestic surveillance program, has gained the cooperation of some of the country's biggest telecommunications companies to obtain access to large volumes of international phone and Internet traffic flowing in and out of the United States.</p>

<p>The agency has traced and analyzed the traffic flow - looking at who is calling whom, where calls originate and end, and other patterns - to gather clues on possible terrorist activities.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Abramoff Likely to Cop Plea</h3>
	
	<p>Jack Abramoff, the Republican lobbyist under indictment for fraud in South Florida, is expected to complete a plea agreement in the Miami criminal case, setting the stage for him to become a crucial witness in a broad federal corruption investigation, people with direct knowledge of the case said.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>But after a lengthy bargaining phase, Mr. Abramoff's lawyers and prosecutors in the Florida case appear closer to resolving several of the central issues in the plea deal, in which the defendant would receive a reduced prison sentence - most likely in the range of five to seven years, though that is fluid - in exchange for pleading guilty and agreeing to testify against his former associates.</p>

<p>Mr. Abramoff was indicted in Florida on Aug. 11 on charges stemming from his purchase of a fleet of casino boats in 2000. Prosecutors said Mr. Abramoff and a business partner, Adam Kidan, falsified documents and lied about their financing in order to complete the purchase. Mr. Kidan pleaded guilty last week, leaving Mr. Abramoff to face six criminal counts and up to 30 years in prison as case's sole defendant.</p>

<p>At the same time, <b>prosecutors in Washington have been sifting through evidence of what they believe is a corruption scheme involving at least a dozen lawmakers and their former staff members, many of whom worked closely on legislation with Mr. Abramoff and accepted gifts and favors from him.</b> Although Mr. Abramoff is also in negotiations in that case, it is unclear whether a settlement can be reached in time for both agreements to be announced at once.</p>

	<h3 class="title">China's Economy Larger Than Previously Thought</h3>
	
	<p>China's economy took another Great Leap Forward -- this one overnight.</p>

<p>The economy is worth about $2 trillion, 17 percent larger and growing faster than previous estimates, according to a government report released in Beijing today. The new figures may vault China three places, to No. 4, on the list of the world's largest economies, surpassing the U.K.</p>

<p>A year-long census revealed millions of companies previously unaccounted for, the National Bureau of Statistics said. Most are in service industries that are growing faster than manufacturing.</p>

<p>The census, which added the equivalent of Austria's annual output to the world's fastest-growing major economy, may heighten U.S. and European efforts to convince China to let its currency appreciate, said Jim Walker, chief economist at CLSA Emerging Markets in Hong Kong. </p>

	<h3 class="title">OPEC Raises 2006 Demand Estimate</h3>
	
	<p><i>If you do the arithmetic you will note that the anticipated daily production lags anticipated daily demand by between 3.3 million bpd.  Note also that China is expected to account for one fifth of the increase in demand next year.  AG</i></p>

<p>The OPEC oil cartel raised Friday its forecast for growth in oil demand next year based on predictions of stronger-than-expected expansion of the world economy.</p>

<p>World demand for oil will increase by 1.9 per cent in 2006 to 84.9 million barrels per day, OPEC said in a report released in Vienna, updating a previous forecast of 84.8 million bpd.</p>

<p>The forecast is a "slight increase" over its outlook issued in November with demand set to increase in all major regions, OPEC said. China is to account for more than one fifth of the increase of 1.6 million bpd.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The latest OPEC report said that production in countries outside of the cartel would be 51.6 million bpd in 2006, an increase of 1.4 million bpd compared with 2005.</p>

<p>OPEC, which supplies about 40 per cent of world demand, confirmed that its members had produced 30 million bpd during November. The average price of oil, calculated by using a basket of 11 types of crude oil around the world, fell by 3.34 dollars in November to 51.29 dollars on average, OPEC said.</p>

	<h3 class="title">The Most Greenhouse Gas in the Past 650,000 Years</h3>
	
	<p>Shafts of ancient ice pulled from Antarctica's frozen depths show that for at least 650,000 years three important heat-trapping greenhouse gases never reached recent atmospheric levels caused by human activities, scientists are reporting today.</p>

<p>The measured gases were carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Concentrations have risen over the last several centuries at a pace far beyond that seen before humans began intensively clearing forests and burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels.</p>

<p>The sampling and analysis were done by the European Program for Ice Coring in Antarctica, and the results are being published today in the journal Science.</p>

<p>The evidence was found in air bubbles trapped in successively older ice samples extracted from a nearly two-mile-deep hole drilled in a remote spot in East Antarctica called Dome C.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Saudi Capacity in (Official) Doubt</h3>
	
	<p><i>This is the biggest Peak Oil news I've seen in a while.  Notice in particular the expert who a) pokes holes in the Saudi reserve estimates and b) shoots down the U.S.G.S. survey the Saudis used to justify their claims.  Does anyone else notice anything strange about Saudis relying on U.S.G.S. surveys--and ones unsupported by field work at that--to justify their optimistic (er... false) reserve claims?  AG</i></p>

<p> "There's always been this tenet on the American side," said Nawaf Obaid, a consultant to Saudi Arabia on energy security, "that the Saudis knew what they were doing and rightfully so."</p>

<p>But a senior intelligence official, who insisted on remaining anonymous because he was not permitted to speak publicly on the issue, said that the Saudi plans to increase production by nearly 14 percent in the next four years were not enough to meet global demand. Even the Energy Information Administration recently scaled back its expectations of how much more oil the Saudis could pump in 20 years.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, told reporters after the [April 2002] meeting [between Bush and Crown Prince Abdullah] that the Saudi program was "a very good plan because it addresses the underlying issue you have when you talk about price, which is an issue of availability of oil and availability of capacity."</p>

<p>But there are doubts about the Saudi assertions about how much oil they have. Data about reserves is tightly guarded, and the Saudis dismiss skeptics as uninformed.</p>

<p>But they do not dismiss Edward O. Price Jr., the former head of exploration for Saudi Aramco and an adviser to the United States government about Persian Gulf oil during both Iraq wars. He questioned future reliance on Saudi capacity in an article in The New York Times last year and wanted to know from his former colleagues how they reached their estimate of more than 150 billion barrels of extra oil. Twenty years ago, a detailed study by geologists from four large American oil companies then in partnership with Aramco found little in the way of undiscovered oil resources, he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Saleri, who manages Saudi reservoirs, met with Mr. Price in the United States last year. Saudi Aramco officials declined to respond to questions about the meeting. But Mr. Price said in an interview that Mr. Saleri told him that the basis for the higher oil figures was a global study in 2000 by the United States Geological Survey estimating Saudi Arabia's undiscovered resources at 87 billion barrels.</p>

<p>Mr. Price said he responded that the estimates "by the U.S.G.S. had no credibility and far exceeded the detailed studies by the old Aramco team." The Aramco study, unlike the survey estimate, involved detailed field work.</p>

<p>Questions about Saudi Arabia's long-term estimates were also raised last year in a report by the National Intelligence Council, an advisory panel that produces the government's most authoritative intelligence estimates, according to a government official who insisted on not being identified because the report was classified.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Thawing Arctic Presents Opportunities for Profit</h3>
	
	<p><i>Fascinating in-depth NY Times article about the thawing arctic and the economic possibilities that thawing opens.  Big implications for gas & petroleum exploration, shipping, fisheries and international relations.  Note the article's decidedly non-committal take on global warming.  I'm getting so sick of this crap: the Artic ice is smaller than it's EVER been in MILLENIA but it might be attributable to natural cycles.  Bullshit.  </i> AG</p>

<p>It seems harsh to say that bad news for polar bears is good for Pat Broe. Mr. Broe, a Denver entrepreneur, is no more to blame than anyone else for a meltdown at the top of the world that threatens Arctic mammals and ancient traditions and lends credibility to dark visions of global warming.</p>

<p>Still, the newest study of the Arctic ice cap - finding that it faded this summer to its smallest size ever recorded - is beginning to make Mr. Broe look like a visionary for buying this derelict Hudson Bay port from the Canadian government in 1997. Especially at the price he paid: about $7.</p>

<p>By Mr. Broe's calculations, Churchill could bring in as much as $100 million a year as a port on Arctic shipping lanes shorter by thousands of miles than routes to the south, and traffic would only increase as the retreat of ice in the region clears the way for a longer shipping season.</p>

<p>With major companies and nations large and small adopting similar logic, the Arctic is undergoing nothing less than a great rush for virgin territory and natural resources worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Even before the polar ice began shrinking more each summer, countries were pushing into the frigid Barents Sea, lured by undersea oil and gas fields and emboldened by advances in technology. But now, as thinning ice stands to simplify construction of drilling rigs, exploration is likely to move even farther north.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Artic Ice Shrinking More Rapidly</h3>
	
	<p><i>The so-called "controversial" evidence of global warming adds another straw to the camel's back.  20% reduction in just over 25 years.  That's obviously not statistically significant.  /sarcasm</i> AG</p>

<p>The floating cap of sea ice on the Arctic Ocean shrank this summer to what is probably its smallest size in a century, continuing a trend toward less summer ice that is hard to explain without attributing it in part to human-caused global warming, various experts on the region said today.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>It also appears that the change is becoming self sustaining, with the increased open water absorbing solar energy that would be reflected back into space by bright white ice, said Ted A. Scambos, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo., which compiled the data along with NASA.</p>

<p>"Feedbacks in the system are starting to take hold," Dr. Scambos said. "The consecutive record-low extents make it pretty certain a long-term decline is underway."</p>

<p>The North Pole ice cap always grows in winter and shrinks in the summer, but the new summer low, measured on Sept. 19th, was 20 percent below the average minimum ice extent measured from 2000 back to 1978, when precise satellite mapping of the ice began, the snow and ice center reported. </p>

	<p><i>Chock full of interesting facts and figures.</i>  AG</p>

<p>Even as the economy grew, incomes stagnated last year and the poverty rate rose, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. It was the first time on record that household incomes failed to increase for five straight years.</p>

<p>The portion of Americans without health insurance remained roughly steady at 16 percent, the bureau said. A smaller percentage of people were covered by their employers, but two big government programs, Medicaid and military insurance, grew.</p>

<p>The census's annual report card on the nation's economic well-being showed that a four-year-old expansion had still not done much to benefit many households. Median pretax income, $44,389, was at its lowest point since 1997, after inflation.</p>

	<p><i>For those of you who dispute that CNOOC's bid for Unocal represented a threat to US national security, I offer the emphasized statement below.  I'm not saying I support the overall US national security strategy, I'm just saying that China's avid pursuit of petroleum resources represents a threat to it as it exists today.  </i>AG</p>

<p>China's biggest state-owned oil company agreed today to pay $4.18 billion for a Canadian oil company with substantial reserves in Kazakhstan, China's largest foreign acquisition yet.</p>

<p>The China National Petroleum Corporation outbid India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in reaching a deal to acquire PetroKazakhstan. The bidding underlined growing competition for oil resources by the world's two most populous countries, both of which are rapidly increasing their oil imports.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>In the oil industry, <b>"China has consistently been willing to overpay for assets; it's more of a security issue for them than the absolute price," </b>said John Kuzmik, a partner and China specialist at Baker Botts, a big Houston energy law firm. India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation reportedly bid $3.6 billion.</p>

	<p><i>Second (or first, depending on how you look at it) military officer affirms that Able Danger identified Atta in early '00.  Watch the Pentagon work overtime to bury this.  </i>AG</p>

<p>An active-duty Navy captain has become the second military officer to come forward publicly to say that a secret defense intelligence program tagged the ringleader of the Sept. 11 attacks as a possible terrorist more than a year before the attacks.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>His comments came on the same day that the Pentagon's chief spokesman, Lawrence Di Rita, told reporters that the Defense Department had been unable to validate the assertions made by an Army intelligence veteran, Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer, and now backed up by Captain Phillpott, about the early identification of Mr. Atta.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>He [Pentagon spokesman] said that while Colonel Shaffer and Captain Phillpott were respected military officers whose accounts were taken seriously, "thus far we've not been able to uncover what these people said they saw - memory is a complicated thing."</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>With his comments today, Captain Phillpott acknowledged that he was the officer who had briefed the [9/11] commission last year. "I will not discuss the issues outside of my chain of command and the Department of Defense," he said. "But my story is consistent. Atta was identified by Able Danger in January-February of 2000. I have nothing else to say.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Secret Military Intel Unit Identifed Atta in '00</h3>
	
	<p><i>Note the oblique references to PROMIS-type software (bold text).  It also sounds pretty obvious that someone wanted this buried and manipulated things from several angles to make sure that happened.  </i>AG</p>

<p>More than a year before the Sept. 11 attacks, a small, highly classified military intelligence unit identified Mohammed Atta and three other future hijackers as likely members of a cell of Al Qaeda operating in the United States, according to a former defense intelligence official and a Republican member of Congress.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2000, the military team, known as Able Danger, prepared a chart that included visa photographs of the four men and recommended to the military's Special Operations Command that the information be shared with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the congressman, Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, and the former intelligence official said Monday.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>A former spokesman for the Sept. 11 commission, Al Felzenberg, confirmed that members of its staff, including Philip Zelikow, the executive director, were told about the program on an overseas trip in October 2003 that included stops in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But Mr. Felzenberg said the briefers did not mention Mr. Atta's name.</p>

<p>The report produced by the commission last year does not mention the episode.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The unit, <b>which relied heavily on data-mining techniques</b>, was modeled after those first established by Army intelligence at the Land Information Warfare Assessment Center, now known as the Information Dominance Center, at Fort Belvoir, Va., the official said.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The official said the link to Brooklyn was meant as a term of art rather than to be interpreted literally, saying that the unit had produced no firm evidence linking the men to the borough of New York City but that <b>a computer analysis seeking to establish patterns in links between the four men had found that "the software put them all together in Brooklyn."</b></p>

	<h3 class="title">China Lets Yuan Rise</h3>
	
	<p>The announcement from China on Thursday that it would, at long last, raise the value of the yuan against the dollar and continue to do so gradually quiets the alarmists for the moment. Thanks to the revaluation, no one can claim that the sky is falling - at least this weekend. "The Chicken Littles are really wrong," said James Glassman, chief domestic economist at J. P. Morgan Chase.</p>

<p>But such criticism hasn't stopped the Cassandras from pressing their case.</p>

<p>Even gradually reducing the value of the dollar by an amount large enough - say 30 percent to 40 percent - so that Americans are finally discouraged from buying increasingly expensive Asian goods, may have unpleasant consequences. Among other dangers there is the risk that China will cut back on its purchases of American government securities, contributing to a sharp rise in long-term interest rates.</p>

<p>The Cassandras who hold this view are a distinct minority, like their original in ancient Greece. Still, the most prominent, like Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve Board chairman, are hard to ignore.</p>

<p>"The circumstances seem to be as dangerous and intractable as any I can remember," Mr. Volcker said Thursday, repeating an earlier warning in a February speech. "If people lose confidence in the dollar as a store of value, or lose confidence in the political strength of the United States relative to other countries, there is going to be trouble. I'm not saying a crisis is inevitable or that an orderly adjustment is impossible, but at some point big adjustments will have to be made."</p>

<p>The problem stems from America's persistent buying of much more from other countries, particularly China and Japan, than those countries purchase from the United States. The payment for the imports is in dollars, and because the foreigners do not use all of the dollars to make offsetting purchases here, they lend the excess back to Americans, who then use the loans to purchase more from abroad.</p>

	<h3 class="title">US to Make Plutonium 238 Again</h3>
	
	<p><i>Emphasis below is mine.  AG</i></p>

<p>The Bush administration is planning the government's first production of plutonium 238 since the cold war, stirring debate over the risks and benefits of the deadly material. The substance, valued as a power source, is so radioactive that a speck can cause cancer.</p>

<p>Federal officials say the program would produce a total of 330 pounds over 30 years at the Idaho National Laboratory, a sprawling site outside Idaho Falls some 100 miles to the west and upwind of Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. Officials say the program could cost $1.5 billion and generate more than 50,000 drums of hazardous and radioactive waste.</p>

<p>Project managers say that most if not all of the new plutonium is intended for secret missions and they declined to divulge any details. But in the past, it has powered espionage devices.</p>

<p>"The real reason we're starting production is for national security," Timothy A. Frazier, head of radioisotope power systems at the Energy Department, said in a recent interview.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Plutonium 238 has no central role in nuclear arms. Instead, it is valued for its steady heat, which can be turned into electricity. Nuclear batteries made of it are best known for powering spacecraft that go where sunlight is too dim to energize solar cells. For instance, they now power the Cassini probe exploring Saturn and its moons.</p>

<p>Federal and private experts unconnected to the project said the new plutonium would probably power devices for conducting espionage on land and under the sea. Even if no formal plans now exist to use the plutonium in space for military purposes, these experts said that the material could be used by the military to power compact spy satellites that would be hard for adversaries to track, evade or destroy.</p>

<p><b>"It's going to be a tough world in the next one or two decades, and this may be needed,"</b> said a senior federal scientist who helps the military plan space missions and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the possibility that he would contradict federal policies. "Technologically, it makes sense."</p>

	<p>Top venture firms on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., are beginning to show serious interest in the alternative energy sector, though that typically means venturing outside their core expertise. They hope to capitalize on the growing worldwide demand for energy at a time of rising energy costs, and they see potential for huge profits in technology that can address challenges like climate change and dwindling natural resources.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Clean tech represented a 1.2 percent share of the total dollar amount of venture capital invested in 2000. In 2004, the $520 million that venture capitalists invested accounted for a 2.6 percent share of the overall venture pie.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia is the only nation with much spare oil production capacity, an anomaly that originated in the 1970's when the American owners of Aramco, the energy concern that is now controlled by the government in Riyadh, invested heavily in drilling.

	<h3 class="title">US Resistance to Strengthening the NPT</h3>
	
	<p><i>In reading about the US' lack of enthusiasm for a treaty on space weapons, I ran across mentions of how the US "sabotaged" the recent Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review.  A Google news search for "Nuclear Proliferation Treaty Review" (without the quotes) turned up only a few entries. (Only one of the top 20 hits sorted by relevance was from a major US newpaper or other mainstream US news.)  The two most interesting were this article and the US Department of State press release I posted below.  I particularly noted the contrast between the stated desire to strengthen the treaty and the US' refusal to extend the treaty indefinitely, as well as the refusal to establish a "no nukes zone" in the Middle East.  AG</i></p>

<p>The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 2005 Review Conference ended here in failure May 27. Many countries, nongovernmental groups and peace activists said a successful outcome, which would have advanced global nuclear disarmament, was blocked by the Bush administration.</p>

<p>Chilean UN Ambassador Alfredo Labbe said the failed review represented �missed opportunities to practice multilateralism.� In an obvious reference to the U.S., Labbe echoed the views of many when he said �some countries� had abused the rules of consensus to effectively exercise veto power over the review.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>U.S. representatives, appointed by the Bush administration, stalled over a number of issues. Most nations wanted the agenda to include references to agreements reached in 1995 and 2000, including the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and an indefinite extension of the NPT. The stalemate only ended when other states, realizing that time was short, capitulated to the U.S. and agreed that there would be no reference to these issues in the final document, only a verbal mention of them in the opening statement by the conference president.</p>

<p>Another issue that held up adoption of an agenda was U.S. opposition to a proposal pushed by Egypt, but backed by others, to establish a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East.</p>

	<p><i>The emphasis below is mine.  If that sentence accurate represents the US position, then that is nothing but a blatant lie, because you can read in these pages about the weapons systems that the US is planning to deploy in space within the next few decades.  AG</i></p>

<p>Russia and China addressed member countries of the United Nations Disarmament Conference today. They called to resume the work of a special committee for the prevention of arms race in space, which was suspended back in 1994.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> Russia and China have long been calling Conference member countries to elaborate, within its framework, a legally binding international instrument to prohibit arms basing in space.</p>

<p>They repeatedly offered to the Conference for consideration working documents to fill in gaps in the international space law. Meanwhile, this legislation makes no essential ban on R&D for, and deployment of anti-satellite weaponry, as well as development of anti-missile defense systems or their space-based components.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The United States' stance on the problem remains vague to this day. As the USA said several years ago, <b>it does not recognize the Star War danger-the problem belongs to too distant a future to open related negotiations now.</b></p>

	<p><i>Note the passing reference to reporting detailing "an immediate threat to Taiwan" and the attempt to exploit "perceived" US weaknesses.  Nevermind that even allowing for the widely held belief that roughly a third of Chinese military spending is hidden, unreported, or otherwise kept secret, China still lags far, far behind the US in military expenditures.  If they have studied the American military carefully, though, they know that our communications and observation satellites are one of our greatest weak points.  One thing we rarely ever hear anything about is Chinese space spending and/or satellite launches.  AG</i></p>

<p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, in an unusually blunt public critique of China, said Saturday that Beijing's military spending threatened the delicate security balance in Asia and called for an emphasis instead on political freedom and open markets.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>In recent weeks, American officials have compiled reports detailing how China has carefully analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of the United States military to focus its growing spending on weapons systems that could exploit perceived American weaknesses in case the United States ever responds to fighting in Taiwan.</p>

<p>These military and intelligence officials say China has purchased or built enough amphibious assault ships, submarines, fighter jets and short-range missiles that pose an immediate threat to Taiwan and to any American force that might come to Taiwan's aid.</p>

	<h3 class="title">SEC Chairman Stepping Down: Under Pressure for Busting too Many Crooks</h3>
	
	<p><i>Jeeze, wouldn't want to enforce the laws or anything.  Emphasis is mine.  AG</i></p>

<p>William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced his resignation on Wednesday, after repeated criticism from his two fellow Republican members of the agency and from some business groups and administration officials <b>who contended that his enforcement and policy decisions had been too heavy-handed.</b></p>

<p>Mr. Donaldson's resignation, which becomes effective at the end of the month, could give President Bush the opportunity to appoint a successor who might tip the balance at the agency toward the more deregulatory agenda favored by the remaining Republicans on the five-member commission.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Mr. Donaldson's resignation comes after the departure in recent months of several top officials, including Paul Roye, who oversaw the mutual fund industry, and Stephen M. Cutler, head of the enforcement division. Both divisions were upstaged by cases brought by Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, and responded in ways that some industry groups said were excessive.</p>

	<h3 class="title">On the Trail of the CIA: Cutout Air Companies</h3>
	
	<p><i>It's old hat to a lot of people, but there it is on the front page of the online edition of the Times in case you run into any naysayers.  AG</i></p>

<p>The airplanes of Aero Contractors Ltd. take off from Johnston County Airport here, then disappear over the scrub pines and fields of tobacco and sweet potatoes. Nothing about the sleepy Southern setting hints of foreign intrigue. Nothing gives away the fact that Aero's pilots are the discreet bus drivers of the battle against terrorism, routinely sent on secret missions to Baghdad, Cairo, Tashkent and Kabul.</p>

<p>When the Central Intelligence Agency wants to grab a suspected member of Al Qaeda overseas and deliver him to interrogators in another country, an Aero Contractors plane often does the job. If agency experts need to fly overseas in a hurry after the capture of a prized prisoner, a plane will depart Johnston County and stop at Dulles Airport outside Washington to pick up the C.I.A. team on the way.</p>

<p>Aero Contractors' planes dropped C.I.A. paramilitary officers into Afghanistan in 2001; carried an American team to Karachi, Pakistan, right after the United States Consulate there was bombed in 2002; and flew from Libya to Guant�namo Bay, Cuba, the day before an American-held prisoner said he was questioned by Libyan intelligence agents last year, according to flight data and other records.</p>

<p>While posing as a private charter outfit - "aircraft rental with pilot" is the listing in Dun and Bradstreet - Aero Contractors is in fact a major domestic hub of the Central Intelligence Agency's secret air service. The company was founded in 1979 by a legendary C.I.A. officer and chief pilot for Air America, the agency's Vietnam-era air company, and it appears to be controlled by the agency, according to former employees.</p>

<p>Behind a surprisingly thin cover of rural hideaways, front companies and shell corporations that share officers who appear to exist only on paper, the C.I.A. has rapidly expanded its air operations since 2001 as it has pursued and questioned terrorism suspects around the world.</p>

	<h3 class="title">The Caspian Bust</h3>
	
	<p><i>Extremely informative article about the Caspian oil boom that never was.  Some people think that it was the realization in the late 90s that Caspian oil was a bust that brought on America's militaristic adventurism.  It certainly makes sense as a motive: if you think you've just secured an untapped 200 billion barrel bonanza then with sufficient investment supply can meet demand for quite some time despite the world's growing appetite.  If your imagined 200 billion barrels turns out to be less than a sixth of what that, then you've got a big problem in that demand is going to outstrip supply a lot sooner and you'd better get yours quick by hook or by crook.  AG</i></p>

<p> Tomorrow morning, amid expected fanfare at BP PLC's gleaming Sangachal terminal on Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea coast, crude oil will finally start to flow into one of the most significant and expensive pipelines ever built. It's a day that, once upon a time, was supposed to forever alter global oil markets, making prices fall at the gas station near you and finally lessening the West's reliance on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>

<p>But after 10 years of hype, the Caspian oil balloon has burst. When the first crude begins its winding 1,760-kilometre path through mountain passes and around conflict zones on its way to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, few will be expecting it to have much of an impact on oil prices. Instead, the question that will be asked is: How much more oil is there, really? And how did so many get so badly snookered?</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Back in the 1990s, the U.S. State Department was the lead cheerleader behind the boom, telling analysts and oilmen that there were up to 200 billion barrels of crude under the choppy black waters of the Caspian Sea, a figure comparable only to the 262 billion barrels believed to sit beneath the sands of Saudi Arabia. No less a figure than Dick Cheney, then the plugged-in chief executive officer of oil services giant Halliburton Co., got caught up in the excitement. "I cannot think of a time when we have had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian," he said in 1998.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>But just as the crude is finally starting to creep westward, it's becoming clear that there's much, much less oil in the region than had been originally trumpeted. Instead of the 200 billion barrels predicted in 1995, most estimates now put the figure at somewhere between 17 and 32 billion, most of it on the other side of the Caspian from Azerbaijan, in the waters off Kazakhstan.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Caspian to Med Pipeline Opens</h3>
	
	<p>A long-awaited $3.6 billion pipeline linking the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean took its first flow of crude oil from Azerbaijan on Wednesday, opening a conduit that may help reduce Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil.</p>

<p>Heads of state from the neighboring countries of Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkey were on hand for the inauguration ceremony not far from Baku, the Azerbaijan capital. The United States energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, and Lord Browne, chief executive of the British energy giant BP, which led the pipeline investment consortium were also there.</p>

<p>The presence of the officials underscored how politically important the Caspian region has become as an alternative energy source to the Middle East.</p>

<p>The pipeline, first planned in 1994, will carry crude oil from fields in the Caspian Sea off Baku to Tbilisi in Georgia, and on to the Mediterranean terminal at Ceyhan in Turkey. The fields are estimated to hold 4.6 billion barrels of oil and 3.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Tar Sands: Pros and Cons</h3>
	
	<p><i>The best article I have ever seen on the Alberta tar sands.  No matter how you slice it the environmental implications are scary.  The article doesn't directly address the Peak Oilers' argument about why the tar sands are a false hope.  However, given the current rate of 400 billion cubic feet per year of natural gas consumption and the fact that in situ exraction is more energy intensive, the tar sands sound less than promising.  Assuming consumption triples by 2015 as the article speculates and given Canada's current reserves of 62 TCF of gas, Canada can only produce tar sands for 50 years at projected 2015 levels without importing gas.  Since I'm sure they use their gas for other things (such as to sell to the US), we can probably safely cut that to 12.5 years of production at projected 2015 levels before they have to import gas to extract bitumen from tar sands.  Regardless, the whole problem of using gas to get petroleum from tar sands is a lot thornier than this article makes it sound.  AG</i></p>

<p>At the end of a long northern highway, surrounded by a flat horizon of spruce forest and muskeg swamp, lies the energy future of the United States: the largest known petroleum deposit in the world outside Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>This future isn't a pretty sight. Just north of the oil boomtown of Fort McMurray, the forest suddenly falls away into a series of enormous strip mines as deep as 250 feet and covering many square miles each. Viewed from the rim, 60-foot-tall shovel loaders look like toys as they claw ton after ton of tar-like sands from the ground. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>These oil sands are the world's most expensive, most polluting source of oil under large-scale production. Wringing four barrels of crude oil from the sands requires burning the equivalent of a fifth barrel. The mines and refineries release huge amounts of greenhouse gases -- the equivalent each day to more than a third of California's daily car emissions.</p>

<p>Yet Alberta's oil sands are destined to be the main supply of foreign oil to the United States for at least the next century. The sands hold proven reserves of 175 billion barrels, second only to Saudi Arabia's 262 billion, and far more than the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's estimated 10 billion. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>About 20 percent of the oil-sand deposits lie close enough to the surface that they can be strip-mined, and nearly all current production uses this process.</p>

<p>But as these pits are depleted, companies will be forced to go after deeper deposits. Those are extracted by a process known as "in situ," or in position, in which steam is pumped into underground deposits to dissolve the thick oil and allow it to be piped to the surface.</p>

<p>In-situ work is much more expensive than open-pit mining, requiring about four times as much natural gas to create the steam. </p>

<p>In both methods, the extremely heavy oil that is produced, called bitumen, has to be further refined into lighter synthetic crude oil before it can be piped to customers, mostly in the U.S. West and Midwest, for further refining and distribution.</p>

<p>Even though costs have dropped, the oil sands process remains inefficient. Two tons of sand yield a single barrel -- 42 gallons -- of oil. On average, each barrel creates more greenhouse gas emissions than four cars do in a day. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The oil sands industry now consumes about 400 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year, an amount that could triple by 2015 as oil production rises by the same amount.</p>

	<h3 class="title">A Move Against Syria</h3>
	
	<p><i>It does sound a bit like the classic set-up.  AG</i></p>

<p>Syria has halted military and intelligence cooperation with the United States, its ambassador to Washington said in an interview, in a sign of growing strains between the two nations over the insurgency in Iraq.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Mr. Moustapha said he believed that the Bush administration had decided "to escalate the situation with Syria" despite steps the Syrians have taken against the insurgents in Iraq, and despite the withdrawal in recent weeks of Syrian troops from Lebanon, in response to international demands.</p>

<p>He said American complaints had been renewed since February, when a half-brother of Saddam Hussein, who was once the widely feared head of Iraq's two most powerful security agencies, was handed over to the Iraqi authorities after being captured in Syria along with several lieutenants. The renewal of complaints caused Syria to abandon the idea of providing further help, he said.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Bush administration officials said Syria's stance has prompted intense debate at high levels in the administration about new steps that might be taken against the Syrian government. The officials said the options included possible military, diplomatic or economic action. But senior Pentagon and military officials cautioned Monday that if any military action was eventually ordered, it was likely to be limited to insurgent movements along the border.</p>

	<p>Worldwide production of essential crops such as wheat, rice, maize and soya beans is likely to be hit much harder by global warming than previously predicted, an international conference in London has heard.</p>

<p>The benefits of higher levels of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, will in fact be outweighed by the downsides of climate change, a Royal Society discussion meeting was told yesterday. It had been thought that the gas might act as a fertiliser to increase plant growth. Rising atmospheric temperatures, longer droughts and side-effects of both, such as higher levels of ground-level ozone gas, are likely to bring about a substantial reduction in crop yields in the coming decades, large-scale experiments have shown.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Bush & Saudis Talk (Peak) Oil</h3>
	
	<p><i>To me today's Times article reads as a tacit admission by the Saudis that they have peaked.  Why?  Because of the fact that both sides avoided the issue of increasing output now, coupled with the fact that promises by the Saudis over the past few months of increased output simply haven't materialized.  That, and the fact that they are focusing on long term investment to expand capacity--i.e. they have to have to invest in infrastructure that will allow them to get the harder-to-get oil.  On top of those things, read Hadley's comments carefully: I've noticed the same theme of assuring markets of adequate supply has crept into the remarks by lots of senior public officials all over the world lately.  They're (still) doing their best to delay to the very last minute the moment when markets wake up to where we really are with respect to our petroleum supplies.  AG</i></p>

<p>President Bush discussed the surge in oil prices with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia on Monday, but focused on a plan by the Saudis to increase their oil-pumping capacity over the next decade rather than on any short-term efforts to bring prices down. </p>

	<h3 class="title">Good, Concise Peak Oil Argument</h3>
	
	<p><i>A concise case for why Peak Oil will hurt.  It avoids speculation on the specifics of the economic impact, but the case for the problem is compelling.</i></p>

<p>5: No alternatives</p>

<p>Making up the gap by exploiting "unconventional" oil is also a false hope. Unconventional oil exists in huge quantities in several big deposits, notably Canada's tar sands and Venezuela's Orinoco oil belt. Tar sands have to be mined, not drilled, and heavy oil is very difficult to pump and refine. To melt the tar in Canada you would need to heat much more water than Alberta's farmers can possibly spare, and burn more Canadian gas than makes the process worthwhile in terms of net energy, even if you care nothing about the greenhouse implications. Even if you do all this, the International Energy Agency expects only 10 million barrels a day by 2030 from unconventional oil sources. That doesn't come close to bridging the gap between supply and anticipated demand.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Peak Oil and America: Economic Effects</h3>
	
	<p><i>Extemely lucid peak oil article.  I think it's absolutely brilliant that it goes on at some length about the great utility of railroads.  For all its lucidity, though, I think it's light on the death and destruction side.  It pretty much glosses over what will happen if you take greater New York (population ~18 million) and deprive it of food in the space of a few years.  It also ignores the wars (or maybe big War) that is/are bound to erupt as our leaders draft us to fight for every last drop of the black gold we can get our hands on.  AG</i></p>

<p>America today has a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of. Neither of the two major presidential candidates in 2004 mentioned railroads, but if we don't refurbish our rail system, then there may be no long-range travel or transport of goods at all a few decades from now. The commercial aviation industry, already on its knees financially, is likely to vanish. The sheer cost of maintaining gigantic airports may not justify the operation of a much-reduced air-travel fleet. Railroads are far more energy efficient than cars, trucks or airplanes, and they can be run on anything from wood to electricity. The rail-bed infrastructure is also far more economical to maintain than our highway network.</p>

<p>The successful regions in the twenty-first century will be the ones surrounded by viable farming hinterlands that can reconstitute locally sustainable economies on an armature of civic cohesion. Small towns and smaller cities have better prospects than the big cities, which will probably have to contract substantially. The process will be painful and tumultuous. In many American cities, such as Cleveland, Detroit and St. Louis, that process is already well advanced. Others have further to fall. New York and Chicago face extraordinary difficulties, being oversupplied with gigantic buildings out of scale with the reality of declining energy supplies. Their former agricultural hinterlands have long been paved over. They will be encysted in a surrounding fabric of necrotic suburbia that will only amplify and reinforce the cities' problems. Still, our cities occupy important sites. Some kind of urban entities will exist where they are in the future, but probably not the colossi of twentieth-century industrialism.</p>

<p>Unifying Taiwan with the mainland has become more than just a nationalist goal. The 13,500-square-mile territory has also become a platform that China needs to protect southern sea lanes, through which pass 80 percent of its imported oil and tons of other imported raw materials. It could serve as a base for Chinese submarines to have unfettered access to the deep Pacific, according to Tsai, Taiwan's deputy defense minister. "<b>Taiwan for them now is a strategic must</b> and no longer just a sacred mission," Lin said.</p>

	<p><i>This isn't the first time someone has claimed Saudi Arabia has already peaked, but this article is a nice bit of reporting with some good background.  If Saudi Arabia has peaked, then it's almost certain that the world has peaked.  If so, we're already on the downward slope and the global stakes are just going to get higher.  Check out the article in the current Nation on the US military's rebasing plans for projecting power into Central Asia.  Not that you haven't already read all about it in the news, but the article puts everything nicely in perspective and gives you a nice little peek at the next world war.  AG</i></p>

<p>Speculation over the actual size of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves is reaching fever pitch as a major bank says the kingdom's - and the world's - biggest field, Gharwar, is in irreversible decline.</p>

<p>The Bank of Montreal's analyst Don Coxe, working from their Chicago office, is the first mainstream number-cruncher to say that Gharwar's days are fated.</p>

	<p><i>Keep an eye on this.  India and China will also have to cooperate militarily in order to counter U.S. military might, but perhaps this will pave the way.  A friendly India will go a long way toward ensuring China remains supplied with Persian Gulf oil and Caspian gas.  AG</i></p>

<p>Indian and Chinese leaders are to create a "strategic partnership for peace and prosperity" with accords aimed at ending a decades-long border dispute and boosting bilateral trade and economic co-operation.</p>

	<h3 class="title">OPEC Supply Is Inadequate for Gasoline</h3>
	
	<p><i>In the vein of today's other articles, but it contains some very interesting facts.  AG</i></p>

<p>Crude oil climbed to a record of more than $58 a barrel on concern that rising output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may be inadequate to produce enough gasoline to meet a summer peak in U.S. demand.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> The European Commission cut its 2005 growth forecast for the second time in six months as record oil costs and rising unemployment weigh on the 12 economies using the euro. Growth will slow to 1.6 percent this year, less than the 2 percent predicted in October, the commission said today in Brussels.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> At a meeting in Iran on March 16, OPEC boosted its quota by 500,000 barrels a day to 27.5 million a day, a record for the 10 members whose output is restrained by self-imposed limits, all except Iraq. With their output close to 28 million barrels a day already, according to Sheikh al-Sabah, most producers are pumping nearly as much as they can and only Saudi Arabia, OPEC's most influential member, can raise production by at least another 1 million barrels a day.</p>

<p>Oil demand is forecast to grow 2.2 percent this year to 84.3 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency. That's equivalent to the content of about 42 supertankers being burnt every day. Consumption climbed by 3.4 percent last year, the biggest increase since 1976. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Cars, trucks and vans in the U.S., the world's largest oil consumer, burn about 10 percent of global oil supplies.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> Petroleos de Venezuela SA's Amuay refinery will be shut for as long as a week because of an electrical failure on March 31. Amuay is part of the Paraguana complex, the world's largest refinery, with production capacity of 935,000 barrels a day. The complex currently processes about 760,000 a day.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts predict oil may touch $105 in coming years if supplies are disrupted. Bets by speculators that prices will rise, or net-long positions, outnumbered shorts by 73,792 contracts on Nymex the week ended March 29, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said, up 4,283 from a week earlier. They peaked at 82,451 in March 2004.</p>

	<p>More than a mile below the choppy Gulf of Mexico waters lies a vast, untapped source of energy. Locked in mysterious crystals, the sediment beneath the seabed holds enough natural gas to fuel America's energy-guzzling society for decades, or to bring about sufficient climate change to melt the planet's glaciers and cause catastrophic flooding, depending on whom you talk to.</p>

	<p><i>Lots of big oil news today.  Note in particular the statements I've emphasised in the entries below.  All are signs that global production is peaking.  It will be most interesting to see if OPEC actually comes through with an increase or not.   Get ready for the big ride.  AG</i></p>

<p>In order to close the Unocal deal, ChevronTexaco said it <b>expects to sell assets that would bring in more than $2 billion. It also sees pre-tax annual cost savings of $325 million.</b>  <i>[Why would they do this?  Because they know they're not going to find more oil.  They're probably selling off infrastructure and lowering their bottom line in order to stay alive while they work on getting out of the oil business. AG]</i></p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p><b>ChevronTexaco said the deal will help it replenish its reserves.</b>  It said Unocal's reserves would increase its proven reserve base of oil by about 15 percent, while natural gas reserves would increase by about 5 percent.  <i>[This is a further indication that the industry continues to consolidate because it knows it's not going to get more petroleum.  This an attempt to keep their book value up.  AG]</i></p>

<p>U.S. light crude for May delivery, New York's active contract, rose 88 cents to an active contract record $58.15 a barrel. That surpassed Friday's high of $57.70, which was triggered by a forecast prices could spike above $100 because of <b>robust global demand and tight spare capacity.</b></p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Non-OPEC producers are pumping at full tilt and have little spare capacity to offer the market. Russian data released on Monday showed the world's second-biggest exporter pumping 9.33 million bpd in March, steady from February.</p>

<p><b>It was the sixth month in a row that output had failed to rise and another sign of a slowdown in Russia's industry.</b></p>

	<h3 class="title">US Hawks Reverse Stand on Iranian Nuke Program</h3>
	
	<p><i>Since thirty years ago, that is.  AG</i></p>

<p> Lacking direct evidence, Bush administration officials argue that Iran's nuclear program must be a cover for bomb-making. Vice President Cheney recently said, "They're already sitting on an awful lot of oil and gas. Nobody can figure why they need nuclear as well to generate energy."</p>

<p>Yet Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and outgoing Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz held key national security posts when the Ford administration made the opposite argument 30 years ago. </p>

<p> Ford's team endorsed Iranian plans to build a massive nuclear energy industry, but also worked hard to complete a multibillion-dollar deal that would have given Tehran control of large quantities of plutonium and enriched uranium -- the two pathways to a nuclear bomb. Either can be shaped into the core of a nuclear warhead, and obtaining one or the other is generally considered the most significant obstacle to would-be weapons builders.</p>

<p>Iran, a U.S. ally then, had deep pockets and close ties to Washington. U.S. companies, including Westinghouse and General Electric, scrambled to do business there. </p>

	<p><i>And you thought it was just me who said he was bad news.  AG</i></p>

<p>Challenging the White House, 59 former American diplomats are urging the Senate to reject John R. Bolton's nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

<p> "He is the wrong man for this position," they said in a letter to Sen. Richard Lugar, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Indiana Republican has scheduled hearings on Bolton's nomination for April 7.</p>

<p>"We urge you to reject that nomination," the former diplomats said in a letter obtained by The Associated Press and dated Tuesday. </p>

<p> The ex-diplomats have served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, some for long terms and others briefly. They include Arthur A. Hartman, ambassador to France and the Soviet Union under Presidents Carter and Reagan and assistant secretary of state for European affairs under President Nixon.</p>

<p>Others who signed the letter include James F. Leonard, deputy ambassador to the U.N. in the Ford and Carter administrations; Princeton N. Lyman, ambassador to South Africa and Nigeria under Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Clinton; Monteagle Stearns, ambassador to Greece and Ivory Coast in the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and Spurgeon M. Keeny Jr., deputy director of the Arms Control Agency in the Carter administration. </p>

	<h3 class="title">Dollar Woes</h3>
	
	<p>There is indeed a volatile blend of risks surrounding the dollar.<br />
.<br />
President George W. Bush's new budget proposal would substantially expand the government's debt burden in the next decade, potentially raising doubts about the desirability of its IOUs. Some Asian central banks have declared that they will diversify their reserves away from dollar-denominated assets. If China decouples the yuan from the dollar, it will not need as many dollar-denominated assets to keep its currency from gaining value, nor will its competitors for export markets. In recent times, long-term interest rates have stayed stubbornly low, making it difficult for American companies to attract new investment from abroad.<br />
.<br />
These ingredients may just be waiting for the right catalyst. If enough people start thinking like those at Bridgewater Associates, the dollar will lose value rapidly. There is no point in buying dollars today, after all, if everyone thinks that they will be worth less in the near future. Fundamental economic factors need not worsen any further; in currency crises, perception very quickly becomes reality.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Draft IEA Report Warns on "Emergency Supply Disruptions" & "Price Shocks"</h3>
	
	<p>The International Energy Agency is to propose drastic cutbacks in car use to halt continuing oil-supply problems. Those cutbacks include anything from car-pooling to outright police-enforced driving bans for citizens.</p>

<p>Fuel "emergency supply disruptions and price shocks" - in other words, shortages - could be met by governments. Not only can governments save fuel by implementing some of the measures suggested, but in doing so they can also shortcut market economics.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>According to the IEA's little-known emergency treaty, the Agreement on an International Energy Programme (IEP), "measures to achieve demand restraint fall into three main classes - persuasion and public information, administrative and compulsory measures, and finally, allocation and rationing schemes".</p>

<p>This would mean that countries who signed up to the treaty, including the five biggest economies of the world - US, Japan, Germany, UK and France - would all have to institute cuts.</p>

<p>"In the event of an activation of IEP emergency response measures, each IEA Member country will be expected to immediately implement demand restraint measures sufficient to reduce oil consumption by 7% of normal demand levels. In a more severe disruption, this could be raised to 10%."</p>

	<p>The Bush Administration has grown increasingly alarmed at a series of weapons purchases by the Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez, that senior United States defence officials described as a "one-man arm's race" that could destabilise South America for decades.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The US Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, who was travelling in South America on Wednesday, urged Mr Chavez to reconsider.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine why Venezuela needs 100,000 AK-47s, and I just personally hope that it doesn't happen," Mr Rumsfeld told reporters in Brasilia in an appearance with the Brazilian Vice-President, Jose Alencar. "And I can't imagine that if it did happen that it would be good for the hemisphere."</p>

<p><i>Or maybe they're just thinking about how they're sitting on a whole pile of oil and a whole bunch of very big scary countries, including the United States, wouldn't think twice about taking that oil by force if they could pull it off with acceptable risk.  The fact that they're buying nearly six times more weapons than they have personnel suggests they're planning for a guerilla insurgency a la Iraq.  AG</i></p>

	<h3 class="title">Iran's Petro-Euro Bourse?</h3>
	
	<p>Oil consuming countries have no choice but to use the American Dollar in order to purchase their oil, since the dollar has so far been the global standard monetary fund for oil exchange. This in turn requires these countries to keep the dollar in their central banks as their reserve fund, therefore 'helping' in strengthening the American economy.</p>

<p>However, if Iran, followed by other oil-producing countries, begins to accept the Euro as another choice for oil exchange the American economy would suffer greatly, what many would call 'a real crisis'. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Many countries have studied the conversion from the ever weakening petro-dollar to the gradually strengthening petro-euro system. The de-valuation of the dollar was caused by the American economy shying away from manufacturing local products, except those of the military, by outsourcing American jobs to cheaper developing countries and depending only on the general service sector, and by the huge cost of two major wars that are still going on.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Backgrounder on Chinese Nuclear Reactors Project</h3>
	
	<p><i>Very informative article about the Westinghouse bid to win the $8 billion Chinese nuclear reactors contract.  AG</i></p>

<p>Westinghouse Electric Co, whose designs run half the world's nuclear reactors, is counting on the US Government to help unseat France's Areva SA as the leader in China's nuclear-power market.</p>

<p>Paris-based Areva, the world's biggest reactor builder, is banking on history: It has supplied four of China's nine working nuclear plants over 20 years. Westinghouse, previously shut out of the market by a US export ban, is now vying with Areva for a US$8-billion contract to build four Chinese reactors.</p>

<p>Both companies submitted bids to meet a February 28 deadline.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Washington-based Export-Import Bank of the United States, a federal agency, approved a Westinghouse request for loans or guarantees of almost US$5 billion to fund the construction of reactors in China, the bank said in a February 18 statement.</p>

<p>Westinghouse and Areva officials say they expect China to choose a winning bidder by early 2006.</p>

<p>Pressure on China to reduce its swelling trade surplus with the United States may give Westinghouse an edge over Areva, says Kidd.</p>

<p>"The very big trade surplus that the Chinese have with the United States might save the US vendors in the next round of bidding," Kidd says. "American companies are pushing very hard, and they're quite hopeful of getting a significant amount of business for the next 10 years."</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> China's plan to increase its nuclear-power capacity to 36,000 megawatts by 2020 will require an estimated 27 new 1,000-megawatt reactors, which would cost about US$2 billion each, indicates a September estimate by Yu Jianfeng, a director at China National Nuclear Corp.</p>

<p>Countries such as the United States and Germany have halted their nuclear programmes because of concerns about safety and environmental risks, highlighted by the 1986 Chernobyl reactor explosion in the Ukraine.</p>

<p>Only a single reactor order has been placed outside Asia since Chernobyl, by Finland in 2003, indicates the World Nuclear Association.</p>

<p>Finland paid US$3.7 billion for a model from Areva's Framatome ANP nuclear-reactor unit, a venture with Germany's Siemens AG.</p>

<p>No nuclear plants have been ordered in the United States since 1978, indicates the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

<p>Germany in 2000 agreed to permanently close its 19 nuclear power plants over the next two decades, after Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met an election pledge to phase out nuclear power.</p>

<p>Indian market closed</p>

<p>While India's nuclear expansion rivals China's in size, with nine reactors under construction and another 24 planned, overseas companies don't stand to profit. They're barred from exporting nuclear technology to India because it hasn't signed the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, says Kidd.</p>

<p>That means China will drive growth in the global nuclear-power market in coming years.</p>

	<p>In the strange calculus nations use to measure strategic power, individual pieces of equipment can have radical, even world changing, implications.</p>

<p>China, for example, has long possessed ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads. But in the last few years China has developed a system to launch those missiles from trucks.</p>

<p>The system is called a Transporter-Erector-Launcher, or TEL. The missile it carries is called a Dongfeng-31. "Dongfeng" means East Wind.</p>

<p>The TEL not only transports the DF-31. The missile is erected and then launched from the vehicle. The entire system is mobile.</p>

<p>"This means in a crisis China can disperse its ballistic missile forces and have a high degree of confidence some of it would survive a pre-emptive strike by a foreign power," says James Mulvenon, who heads a new private think tank in Washington, the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis (Cira). </p>

<p>� The Bush administration stoops to a new low by nominating possibly the least appropriate figure in U.S. public life to fill a post that should excel at building bridges and not tearing them down.</p>

<p>Pathetically enough, the chair that Adlai Stevenson once sat in is now scheduled to be filled by John Bolton, which must be considered a cruel piece of humor on the part of the White House. While the Bush administration ostensibly has set out on a campaign to reform the United Nations, astonishingly enough, it just has nominated Bolton to be the U.S. ambassador to the international body. Akin to calling in the clowns, those familiar with his record believe that there is no one in U.S. public life today more ill-suited for that position than Bolton. His nomination reflects nothing less than an affront to the American people, the diplomatic community and people of goodwill everywhere. It is not a matter that he is too conservative; rather, it reflects the concern generated by his stint as Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security in the first Bush administration where he was demonstrably its most extremist member. </p>

	<h3 class="title">Chavez, Vazquez and... Obrador?</h3>
	
	<p><i>Rambling but informative article about the growing solidarity among leftist leaders in Central, South and possibly North America.  AG </i></p>

<p>On March 1, Uruguayans inaugurated their first ever left-of-center president. This event shattered the power-sharing arrangement that had existed for the last 170 years between the moderate Colorado and Blanco parties. This arrangement, which in many ways mirrored the near half century reign of the similar power-sharing Punto Fijo pact in Venezuela between the Christian Democrats (COPEI) and Democratic Action (AD), ended last October when Uruguayans elected Dr. Tabar� V�zquez, an oncologist, who ran on an anti-neoliberal platform. V�zquez was not the standard bearer of any well entrenched political party but the leader of a medley of relatively small movements that joined together under his Broad Front (Frente Amplio) coalition. The major issue Washington will be watching in the months ahead is not whether V�zquez will chart a leftist course, but just how left-of-center that course will be. Will he adopt a concertaci�n style of government as seen in Chile, a balancing act between populist demands and IMF mandates as in Brazil, or a frontal assault on Washington � at least rhetorically � like Venezuela under Hugo Ch�vez?</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>While the U.S. is forced to barely tolerate Ch�vez so long as he keeps the oil flowing, a L�pez Obrador victory in Mexico next year would likely scorch Washington policymakers, especially if he reverses Vicente Fox�s policy and reaches out to Castro as have Ch�vez, Lula, Kirchner and V�zquez. If he wins, the administration will then be faced with four left-of-center hemispheric powerhouses: Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. The nightmare scenario for the Bush team would then be Ch�vez inviting L�pez Obrador and Mexico�s state owned oil company, Pemex, into a cooperative arrangement with the Venezuelan leader�s oil trading bloc, �Petrosur,� which already includes Argentina and, as of March 2, Uruguay. Given that Mexico and Venezuela are two of the U.S.� top four sources of foreign oil imports (behind Saudi Arabia and Canada), a combined Obrador-Ch�vez alliance would account for upwards of a quarter of all U.S. petroleum imports. One can pretty easily anticipate how the Bush administration would react to such a petro bloc emerging, recalling Henry Kissinger�s old adage that any threat to Saudi oil exports to the U.S. would be a casus belli.</p>

	<h3 class="title">US-British Dispute Over Arms Sales to China</h3>
	
	<p>BRITAIN is facing an increasingly acrimonious argument with America over military exports to China after the Communist party pledged yesterday to push through legislation allowing for war with Taiwan.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Under government guidelines, Britain sells Beijing only �non-lethal� equipment. But study papers written by China�s own defence planners reveal their real priority is not bullets, but software.</p>

<p>Their ambition is to rival the US Seventh Fleet in the sophisticated guidance and radar systems that would determine the outcome of a war to �liberate� Taiwan fought chiefly in the air and at sea. That makes the British balancing act increasingly precarious.</p>

<p>London has already been criticised in Washington for allowing Rolls-Royce to supply Spey jet engines for the Chinese navy�s Xian JH-7 fighter-bomber.</p>

<p>Rolls-Royce says the engines represent 1960s technology. However, defence attach�s visiting an air show in the southern city of Zhuhai noted that the Chinese had used the engines to upgrade the JH-7 into a weapons platform for a long-range missile.</p>

<p>US experts believe the JH-7 represents a new offensive strike capability for the Chinese navy that would undoubtedly be deployed against the Seventh Fleet. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The Americans have previously indicated that if Taiwan showed the will to fight �reunification� with China, they would be prepared to launch operations ranging from the destruction of missile sites in the coastal province of Fujian to attacks on Chinese cities.</p>

	<h3 class="title">China Securing Sea Lanes for Energy</h3>
	
	<p>When Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visits Pakistan this month to inaugurate the Gwadar deepsea port, China will take a giant leap forward in gaining a strategic foothold in the Persian Gulf region. It will advance what a recent Pentagon report describes as Beijing's "string of pearls" strategy that aims to project Chinese power overseas and protect China's energy security at home.</p>

<p>Gwadar is a fishing village on the Arabian Sea coast in the Pakistani province of Balochistan. Balochistan shares borders with Afghanistan and Iran to the west - Gwadar is just 72 kilometers from the Iranian border. More important is Gwadar's proximity to the Persian Gulf. It is situated near the mouth of this strategic body of water, and about 400km from the Strait of Hormuz, a major conduit for global oil supplies.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>A presence in Gwadar provides China with a "listening post" where it can "monitor US naval activity in the Persian Gulf, Indian activity in the Arabian Sea and future US-Indian maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean", writes Haider. A recent report titled "Energy Futures in Asia" produced by defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton for the Pentagon notes that China has already set up electronic eavesdropping posts at Gwadar, which are monitoring maritime traffic through the Strait of Hormuz and the Arabian Sea.</p>

<p>Drawing attention to China's "string of pearls" strategy, the report points out that "China is building strategic relationships along the sea lanes from the Middle East to the South China Sea in ways that suggest defensive and offensive positioning to protect China's energy interests, but also to serve broad security objectives". The port and naval base in Gwadar is part of the "string of pearls".</p>

<p>The other "pearls" in the string include facilities in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and the South China Sea that Beijing has acquired access to by assiduously building ties with governments in these countries.</p>

<p>The Pentagon report sees China's efforts to defend its interests along oil shipping sea lanes as "creating a climate of uncertainty" and threatening "the safety of all ships on the high seas". This perception overlooks the fact that China's "string of pearls" strategy has been triggered by its sense of insecurity. The United States' overwhelming presence in the Gulf and the control of its exercises over the Malacca Strait, through which 80% of China's oil imports pass, has contributed enormously to Beijing's fears that Washington could choke off its oil supply, in the event of hostilities over Taiwan.</p>

	<h3 class="title">A Reasonable Theory of Al-Hariri's Assassination</h3>
	
	<p>To understand who assassinated Rafik al-Hariri we don't need to look any further than the $1.5 billion US Embassy currently under construction in Baghdad. The new embassy, the largest of its kind in the world, will facilitate 1,800 employees and serve as the regional nerve center for American political and economic activity. What does this have to do with al Hariri?</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Al Hariri's assassination provides the raison d'�tre for severing ties with Syria and for transforming Lebanon into a US vassal. This conforms nicely with Israel's ambition to surround itself with non-threatening states as well as affording access to the vital water resources of Lebanon's Wazzani River. In other words, the murder of al Hariri has created some extremely fortunate opportunities for both Israel and the US; merging seamlessly with their overall objectives in the region.</p>

<p>The likelihood that Syria was involved in the assassination is zilch. One can hardly imagine a greater disaster for poor Syria who has been scrambling to avoid the American bludgeon for the last four years. Few people realize that Syria provided more assistance in the first year of the war on terror after 9-11 than any other nation. That's of little consequence now, as the US is on a mission to quickly integrate the entire region beneath the American standard and prove that it can be trusted with its continued stewardship of the world economy.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>We should also consider the assassination in terms of the drooping dollar. If Washington's plan to control Middle East oil does not succeed, the dollar is headed for the landfill. There's no way that the world will continue to hold paper that represents $8 trillion worth of debt unless that happens to be the only way they can purchase the oil that's essential to their industries. The Bush administration is on a tight "time-line" which requires ham-fisted tactics to play out on city streets in foreign capitals. The murder of al Hariri fits conveniently within this regional strategy.</p>

<p>It's a marvel to see how quickly the forces of empire swing into action when a major event like this transpires. Less than 10 hours after the assassination, Washington was withdrawing its ambassador without even scant knowledge of who was responsible. The press, of course, was immediately deployed to perform its task of "finger-pointing" at Syria and to create the spurious narrative of why such a suicidal action would be in their interest. The US organized small demonstrations in Beirut to march around in front of adoring camera lens to create the impression that the Lebanese masses held Syria accountable. (A nice touch that the US used effectively in both Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia) And the Bush team worked feverishly to frame Syria with an onslaught of prepared accusations and innuendo. By now, we should all know the drill: the main players like Bush stay above the fray and make no reckless claims of guilt on Syria's part, while his emissaries in the media and the Congress heap suspicion on the target state. (Isn't this what happened with the "Swift-boat" fiasco? Bush pretended not to be involved while his underlings and the media devoured Kerry in full view of the national audience.)</p>

	<h3 class="title">Survey has Central Banks Reducing Dollar Reserves</h3>
	
	<p>A recent survey shows that many countries� central banks are reducing their US dollar holdings in favour of the euro.</p>

<p>This trend will hinder the US government�s ability to finance future current account deficits, and will likely push the dollar�s value to decline even further relative to the euro.</p>

<p>The survey�sponsored by the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc., the UK�s second-largest lender, and conducted by the Central Banking Publications Ltd., a London-based publisher�was conducted between September and December of 2004 and published in mid-January 2005.</p>

<p>More than 66 percent of the 56 central banks surveyed prefer the euro to the dollar or find the euro and dollar equally important. The International Monetary Fund had already publicly recognized this shift from the dollar to the euro over the past three years.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Weighing Iran's Nuclear Power Arguments</h3>
	
	<p>Iran's argument that despite vast oil and gas reserves it needs nuclear power to meet booming energy demand holds more water than U.S. officials give credit.</p>

<p>But Tehran, which denies U.S. accusations that it is secretly seeking nuclear arms, is on shakier ground with its insistence on producing its own fuel for atomic reactors through uranium enrichment -- a costly endeavour, both economically and politically, for the Islamic state.</p>

<p>In the absence of a "smoking gun", Washington often says the fact Iran is the No. 2 producer in OPEC and sits on the second biggest natural gas reserves in the world is enough to make its atomic ambitions suspicious.</p>

<p>The Foreign Affairs Select Committee of Britain's parliament said last March that based on a study it commissioned: "It is clear ... that the arguments as to whether Iran has a genuine requirement for domestically produced nuclear electricity are not all, or even predominantly, on one side."</p>

<p>Some U.S. arguments against Iran "were not supported by an analysis of the facts" the committee added, noting that much of the natural gas flared off by Iran -- which U.S. officials say could be harnessed instead of nuclear power -- was not recoverable for energy use.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Hungry Dragon: China's Energy Needs and Strategic Imperatives</h3>
	
	<p><i>A backgrounder on China, its energy needs, and those needs' effect on its international relations.  It is chock-full of interesting facts, such as where China plans to build pipelines and how it is investing in Russian petroleum companies.  AG</i></p>

<p>A notable feature of 2004 was the volatility in oil prices - New York light sweet crude prices reached a peak of US$55.67 on October 25, ending the year up 33.6% at $43.45 per barrel. While a number of supply-side and supply-chain factors have contributed to this situation, the most significant long-term factor contributing to rising oil prices is an increase in Asian demand, most notably from China. China's unprecedented growth not only makes it a driver of a long-term increase in energy prices, but also the most vulnerable to rising oil prices.</p>

<p>China, which has been a net oil importer since 1993, is the world's number two oil consumer after the US and has accounted for 40% of the world's crude oil demand growth since 2000. China's proven oil reserves stand at 18 trillion barrels, and oil imports account for one-third of its crude oil consumption.</p>

<p>China has initiated numerous policies to cope with its increasing energy needs, including stepping up exploration activities within its own borders, diversifying beyond oil to access other energy resources, such as nuclear power, coal, natural gas and renewable energy resources, promoting energy conservation and encouraging investment into energy-friendly technologies such as hydrogen-powered fuel cells and coal gasification.</p>

<p>China has also joined the United States and Japan in developing strategic petroleum reserves, with the creation of 75 days of emergency reserves in four locations in Zhejiang, Shandong and Liaoning provinces.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the face of sporadic power shortages, growing car ownership and air travel across China and the importance of energy to strategically important and growing industries such as agriculture, construction, and steel and cement manufacturing, pressure is going to mount on China to access energy resources on the world stage.</p>

<p>As a result, energy security has become an area of vital importance to China's stability and security. China is stepping up efforts to secure sea lanes and transport routes that are vital for oil shipments, and diversifying beyond the volatile Middle East to find energy resources in other regions, such as Africa, the Caspian, Russia, the Americas and the East and South China Sea region.</p>

<p>However, just as China has for centuries engaged in competition for leadership of Asia, the developing world and status on the world stage, so the need for energy security has now raised the possibility of further competition and confrontation in the energy sphere. </p>

<p>A Russian delegation traveled to Cuba in hopes of reactivating economic and political ties between the two countries ahead of bilateral talks in Moscow, state media reported Monday.</p>

<p>Grigori Elkin, head of Russia's Federal Agency of Technical Standardization and Metrology, led last week's delegation to Havana. He met with Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque and Minister of Government Ricardo Cabrisas, the government's weekly business newspaper Opciones reported.</p>

<p>Cuban are traveling to Moscow in March for a meeting of the Joint Inter-Government Russia-Cuba Commission.</p>

<p>Cuba is most interested in prompting exchange with Russia in the automotive, transportation, biotechnology, aviation and tourism industries, Opciones reported. Officials from the island's sugar ministry said they also want to strengthen trade with Russia. </p>

	<p>China is likely to announce yet another year of double-digit growth in its defence budget in the next week, feeding a modernisation drive that is sparking concern in rival Taiwan of invasion and U.S. worries about stability.</p>

<p>The budget to be revealed by Finance Minister Jin Renqing during the annual parliament session that opens on Saturday will appear relatively modest -- about half that of regional power Japan.</p>

<p>But analysts say the official numbers are an incomplete indicator of the actual scale of resources China is pouring into defence. Many estimate real expenditure is likely to be two to four times what the government says.</p>

<p>Even so, the official growth figure is a stark reminder of the ambitious buildup by the 2.3-million-strong People's Liberation Army, the world's largest standing army but one that would have to pay dearly to retake a well-armed Taiwan.</p>

<p>"I think the official budget will cover around a 10 to 12 percent increase compared with last year," said Andrew Yang, a defence analyst at a private think-tank in Taipei.</p>

<p>In return for the payment to a foundation established for victims of Pinochet's repressive 17-year rule and their survivors, a Spanish court agreed to dismiss criminal charges against current and former directors and officers of the bank, including the Allbrittons. Riggs will pay $8 million. </p>

<p>Riggs and the Allbrittons thought they had a strong defense against the allegations but wanted to resolve the Spanish court action because they wanted to avoid a lengthy court case and because PNC wanted the litigation wrapped up before the final sale, said sources familiar with the reasoning behind the settlement who spoke only on the condition that they not be named because of the bank's continuing legal problems.</p>

	<p><i>Better hope your home isn't a good Wal-Mart site.  AG</i></p>

<p>The Supreme Court appeared sympathetic Tuesday toward a group of New London, Conn., homeowners fighting to keep their land, but the justices seemed equally skeptical of their own power to keep the city from seizing the property to create an upscale development.</p>

<p> It's the first major case on eminent domain, the power of the government to condemn property for redevelopment, to reach the high court in years. The justices fired relentless questions at a lawyer representing the New London residents about why he thought the court should be involved in this dispute and how he would have them distinguish between proper and improper property seizures.</p>

<p>But they also questioned the city's position that it could use eminent domain to condemn any property in order to have it developed into something that produces more tax dollars or creates more jobs.</p>

<p>"Say you have a Motel 6, and the city wants to turn it into a Ritz-Carlton," said Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. "Is that sufficient reason?" </p>

	<p><i>The predictable result of a nuclearized North Korea and China getting access to modern European arms.  There are a few tidbits in this article about the possibility of Japan going nuclear that you may not be aware of.  AG</i></p>

<p>There are fears the North Korean nuclear crisis could spark an Asian arms race involving Japan, a U.S. analyst says.</p>

<p>"A nuclearized Japan is certainly not out of the question in the near future," Ted Fishman told CNN on Monday.</p>

<p>Fishman is the author of "China Inc.: How the Rise of the Next Industrial Superpower Challenges America and the World".</p>

<p>Japan revamped its defense policy in December, to give it a greater role in global military cooperation, and allow it to better respond to terrorist and missile attacks.</p>

<p>Koizumi also recently backed a revision of Japan's post-World War II pacifist constitution to begin calling government troops the Japanese "military" instead of the "self-defense force".</p>

<p>This follows Tokyo's move in 2003 to give the green light for a missile defense system, amid mounting concern of an attack from North Korea. </p>

	<h3 class="title">Backgrounder on the Chinese Reach into the Caribbean</h3>
	
	<p>China is waging an aggressive campaign of seduction in the Caribbean, wooing countries away from relationships with rival Taiwan, opening markets for its expanding economy, promising to send tourists, and shipping police to Haiti in the first communist deployment in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>And the United States, China's Cold War enemy, is benignly watching the Asian economic superpower move into its backyard.</p>

	<h3 class="title">France's Share of Worldwide Arms Market Slips</h3>
	
	<p>Sales of French arms around the world are declining because of stepped-up competition by the United States, Russia and Israel, the French defence ministry said Thursday.</p>

<p>Although France remains the third biggest weapons merchant after the United States and Britain, its share of the market is slipping, a report by the ministry covering sales in 2002-2003 showed.</p>

<p>"The Americans' effort to export is much bigger than it used to be," a senior official in the ministry's arms procurement and sales section, Jean-Paul Panie, said. </p>

	<h3 class="title">Japan and US Retool Defense Agreement</h3>
	
	<p>The United States and Japan will declare Saturday for the first time in a joint agreement that Taiwan is a mutual security concern, according to a draft of the document. Analysts called the move a demonstration of Japan's willingness to confront the rapidly growing might of China.</p>

<p>The United States has long focused attention on the Chinese government's threat to use military force against Taiwan if the island, which China views as a renegade province, moves toward independence. Until now, Japan has been content to let the United States bear the brunt of Beijing's displeasure. </p>

<p>But in the most significant alteration since 1996 to the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance, which remains the cornerstone of U.S. interests in East Asia, Japan will join the Bush administration in identifying security in the Taiwan Strait as a "common strategic objective." Set for release after the "two-plus-two" meeting between Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and their Japanese counterparts in Washington on Saturday, the revisions will also call for Japan to take a greater role in conjunction with U.S. forces both in Asia and beyond, according to a draft copy obtained by The Washington Post.</p>

	<p>The director of the US Central Intelligence Agency has warned that China's military modernisation is tilting the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait and increasing the threat to US forces in the region.</p>

<p>Delivering the agency's annual assessment of worldwide threats on Wednesday, Porter Goss, a former Republican congressman who was named in September to head the CIA, dropped any mention of the co-operative elements of the US-China relationship that characterised recent CIA statements. Instead, he said China was making determined military and diplomatic efforts to �counter what it sees as US efforts to contain or encircle China�.</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging interview with four US newspapers, Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency also described White House policies on Iran and North Korea as inconsistent. Without greater US participation in diplomacy, ElBaradei said, confrontation could increase.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Backgrounder on China's Threatened Anti-Secession Law</h3>
	
	<p>On March 5, China's top legislative body will begin meeting in Beijing, where it is expected to pass an "anti-secession" law aimed squarely at pro-independence Taiwanese. The contents of the law, approved in principle in late December by the legislature's Standing Committee, are shrouded in secrecy. The exact purpose is still unclear. But the very notion of such a law�which suggests possible retaliation by China should Taiwan pursue formal independence�has riled the self-ruled, democratic island.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>For its part, Beijing sees the law, which would likely commit it to using "any means" including war to prevent a permanent break, as a deterrent. Ever since Chen's 2000 election, his every move seems to provoke more distrust; in late 2003, when he proposed a referendum on a new constitution that would take effect in 2008, Beijing read it as a "timetable for independence" and began mulling pre-emptive legal measures. When Chen was re-elected last March, Beijing accelerated its plans. Although Chen insists constitutional reforms are meant to strengthen democracy and not to address issues of sovereignty, Beijing sees the effort as an attempt to formalize Taiwan's de facto independence. Says Yang Lixian, a division chief at the Institute of Taiwan Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing: "When [Chen] proposed this, it was like serving the mainland a notice of war.

	<p><i>So PNC and Riggs renegotiated and are moving forward.  AG</i></p>

<p>Salvaging a deal that appeared dead earlier this week, the regional bank PNC Financial Services Group Inc. struck an agreement to pay about $642 million US in cash and stock for Riggs Bank, an old-line Washington institution that ran into legal trouble over suspicious financial transactions.</p>

<p>PNC said Thursday it has agreed to pay $20 per share for Riggs, $4.25 a share less than the price announced last summer before Riggs ran into regulatory trouble. The agreed price was higher than a revised offer of $19.32 per share that Riggs said PNC had subsequently made and Riggs rejected. </p>

<p>The growing assertiveness of Japan, which has just entered a new row with China over a disputed island, shows it is becoming a "normal nation," a senior US official said.</p>

<p>Japan, a close US ally, has been officially pacifist since its defeat in World War II but has sent troops to Iraq on a breakthrough mission. </p>

<p>"I think Japan in the course of its own internal domestic political discussions is moving in the direction of what a number of Japanese politicians and commentators call the idea of a normal nation," said John Bolton, US undersecretary of state for arms control and international security.</p>

	<p><i>Never heard of the "Mercury News", but there's nothing in this article that surprises me--it all fits the pattern.  AG</i></p>

<p>Until recently, Taiwan was considered safe beyond the reach of Chinese guns across the 100-mile-wide Taiwan Strait. Its air force, equipped with U.S.-made fighters, was thought capable of stopping a Chinese attack mid-strait.</p>

<p>But China's weapons purchases make clear its determination to erase that advantage.</p>

<p>Its acquisitions from Russia alone would equip an air force and navy for a mid-size country - scores of supersonic Su-27 fighters, destroyers, submarines and anti-ship missiles.</p>

<p>Flush with cash from its economic boom, China spent more than $13 billion on Russian weapons in the decade ending in 2003, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, known as SIPRI, which tracks international arms sales.</p>

	<h3 class="title">A Compendium of Iraq War Lies</h3>
	
	<p><i>One of our readers sent me this.  Try not to get apoplectic reading it.  No really, try.  AG</i></p>

<p>I heard Tony Blair say: "Before people crow about the absence of weapons of mass destruction, I suggest they wait a bit."<br />
I heard General Myers say: "Given time, given the number of prisoners now that we're interrogating, I'm confident that we're going to find weapons of mass destruction."<br />
I heard the president say: "Prisoners are being taken, and intelligence is being gathered. Our decisive actions will continue until these enemies of democracy are dealt with."<br />
I heard a soldier describe what they called "bitch in a box": "That was the normal procedure for them when they wanted to soften up a prisoner: stuff them in the trunk for a while and drive them around. The hoods I can understand, and to have them cuffed with the plastic things � that I could see. But the trunk episode � I thought it was kind of unusual. It was like a sweatbox, let's face it. In Iraq, in August, it's hitting 120 degrees, and you can imagine what it was like in the trunk of a black Mercedes."<br />
I heard a National Guardsman from Florida say: "We had a sledgehammer that we would bang against the wall, and that would create an echo that sounds like an explosion that scared the hell out of them. If that didn't work we would load a 9mm pistol, and pretend to be charging it near their head and make them think we were going to shoot them. Once you did that they did whatever you wanted them to do basically. The way we treated these men was hard even for the soldiers, especially after realising that many of these 'combatants' were no more than shepherds."<br />
I heard a marine at Camp Whitehorse say: "The 50/10 technique was used to break down EPWs and make it easier for the HET member to get information from them." The 50/10 technique was to make prisoners stand for 50 minutes of the hour for ten hours with a hood over their heads in the heat. EPWs were "enemy prisoners of war". HETs were "human exploitation teams".<br />
I heard Captain Donald Reese, a prison warden, say: "It was not uncommon to see people without clothing. I was told the 'whole nudity thing' was an interrogation procedure used by military intelligence, and never thought much about it."<br />
I heard Donald Rumsfeld say: "I have not seen anything thus far that says that the people abused were abused in the process of interrogating them or for interrogation purposes."<br />
I heard Private Lynndie England, who was photographed in Abu Ghraib holding a prisoner on a leash, say: "I was instructed by persons in higher rank to stand there, hold this leash, look at the camera, and they took pictures for PsyOps. I didn't really, I mean, want to be in any pictures. I thought it was kind of weird."<br />
Detainees 27, 30 and 31 were stripped of their clothing, handcuffed together nude, placed on the ground, and forced to lie on each other and simulate sex while photographs were taken. Detainee 8 had his food thrown in the toilet and was then ordered to eat it. Detainee 7 was ordered to bark like a dog while MPs spat and urinated on him; he was sodomised with a police stick while two female MPs watched. Detainee 3 was sodomised with a broom by a female soldier. Detainee 15 was photographed standing on a box with a hood on his head and simulated electrical wires were attached to his hands and penis. Detainees 1, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24 and 26 were placed in a pile and forced to masturbate while photographs were taken. An unidentified detainee was photographed covered in faeces with a banana inserted in his anus. Detainee 5 watched Civilian 1 rape an unidentified 15-year-old male detainee while a female soldier took photographs. Detainees 5 and 7 were stripped of their clothing and forced to wear women's underwear on their heads. Detainee 28, handcuffed with his hands behind his back in a shower stall, was declared dead when an MP removed the sandbag from his head and checked his pulse.<br />
I heard Donald Rumsfeld say: "If you are in Washington DC, you can't know what's going on in the midnight shift in one of those many prisons around the world."</p>

	<h3 class="title">NY Times Killed a Story on Bush's Bulge</h3>
	
	<p><i>Having already reached the conclusion that there is nothing that is beyond the criminals in the White House, the story about the bulge always seemed plausible to me.  This story on FAIR, though, about the Times story that almost was really pisses me off.  I guess for some reason I still had a modicum of faith in the Fourth Estate.  AG</i></p>

<p>The so-called Bulgegate story had been getting tremendous attention on the Internet. Stories about it had also run in many mainstream papers, including the New York Times (10/9/04, 10/18/04) and Washington Post (10/9/04), but most of these had been light-hearted. Indeed, the issue had even made it into the comedy circuit, including the monologues of Jay Leno, David Letterman, Jon Stewart and a set of strips by cartoonist Garry Trudeau.</p>

<p>That the story hadn�t gotten more serious treatment in the mainstream press was largely thanks to a well-organized media effort by the Bush White House and the Bush/Cheney campaign to label those who attempted to investigate the bulge as "conspiracy buffs" (Washington Post, 10/9/04). In an era of pinched budgets and an equally pinched notion of the role of the Fourth Estate, the fact that the Kerry camp was offering no comment on the matter�perhaps for fear of earning a "conspiracy buff" label for the candidate himself�may also have made reporters skittish. Jeffrey Klein, a founding editor of Mother Jones magazine, told Mother Jones (online edition, 10/30/04) he had called a number of contacts at leading news organizations across the country, and was told that unless the Kerry campaign raised the issue, they couldn�t pursue it.</p>

	<p>Royal Dutch/Shell Group unveiled another, bigger-than-expected, cut in oil reserves on Thursday but tempered the news by announcing record profits and plans for higher dividends and share buybacks.</p>

<p>Surging oil prices and strong refining margins enabled Shell to report fourth-quarter profits of $5.127 billion on a current cost of supply basis, the measure preferred by analysts.</p>

<p>Full-year profits by this measure were $17.59 billion, or $18.54 billion on a historical-cost basis. Analysts said both figures exceeded any profit ever recorded by a UK-listed company, which Tony Woodley, General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, said argued for the introduction of a windfall tax to curb excessive profits in the oil sector.</p>

Nevertheless, it seems obvious even in this article that the Pentagon is engaging in damage control.  It's also obvious that not all the Congressmen are getting the same story.  AG</i></p>

<p>Senior members of Congress said Monday that they would seek to determine whether the Pentagon had overstepped its bounds by creating new secret battlefield intelligence units within the Defense Intelligence Agency.</p>

<p>A senior military officer and a senior Defense Department official confirmed at a hastily called Pentagon briefing on Monday, after news reports had disclosed the existence of the expanded intelligence operations, that small teams of civilian intelligence specialists were being created to work with Special Operations forces and other troops worldwide on secret missions, including counterterrorism operations.</p>

<p>Nearly three decades before the Sept. 11 attacks, a high-level government panel developed plans to protect the nation against terrorist acts ranging from radiological "dirty bombs" to airline missile attacks, according to declassified documents obtained by The Associated Press.</p>

<p>"Unless governments take basic precautions, we will continue to stand at the edge of an awful abyss," Robert Kupperman, chief scientist for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, wrote in a 1977 report that summarized nearly five years of work by the Cabinet Committee to Combat Terrorism.</p>

<p>The group was formed in September 1972 by President Nixon after Palestinian commandos slaughtered 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games. The committee involved people as diverse as Henry Kissinger to a young Rudolph Giuliani, the once-secret documents show.</p>

	<h3 class="title">New DOD Intel Unit Usurps CIA Territory, Avoids Congressional Oversight</h3>
	
	<p><i>Sometimes you can't make up more amazing stories.  The three articles below from the Washington Post and New York Times focus respectively on a) the DOD's establishment of it's own robust human intelligence program, "Strategic Support Branch", and its concerted effort to avoid Congressional oversight of the unit's operations, b) the incompetent staff it has assigned to this new unit and c) the fact that Special Operations units are apparently operating on US soil.  (Emphasis below is mine.)  AG</i></p>

<p>The Pentagon, expanding into the CIA's historic bailiwick, has created a new espionage arm and is reinterpreting U.S. law to give Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld broad authority over clandestine operations abroad, according to interviews with participants and documents obtained by The Washington Post.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Military and civilian participants said in interviews that <b>the new unit has been operating in secret for two years</b> -- in Iraq, Afghanistan and other places they declined to name. According to an early planning memorandum to Rumsfeld from Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the focus of the intelligence initiative is on "emerging target countries such as Somalia, Yemen, Indonesia, Philippines and Georgia." Myers and his staff declined to be interviewed.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The Pentagon has a vast bureaucracy devoted to gathering and analyzing intelligence, often in concert with the CIA, and news reports over more than a year have described Rumsfeld's drive for more and better human intelligence. But the creation of the espionage branch, the scope of its clandestine operations and the breadth of Rumsfeld's asserted legal authority have not been detailed publicly before. <b>Two longtime members of the House Intelligence Committee, a Democrat and a Republican, said they knew no details before being interviewed for this article.</b></p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> Pentagon officials emphasized their intention to remain accountable to Congress, but they also asserted that defense intelligence missions are subject to fewer legal constraints than Rumsfeld's predecessors believed. That assertion involves new interpretations of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which governs the armed services, and Title 50, which governs, among other things, foreign intelligence.</p>

<p>Under Title 10, for example, the Defense Department must report to Congress all "deployment orders," or formal instructions from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to position U.S. forces for combat. But guidelines issued this month by Undersecretary for Intelligence Stephen A. Cambone state that special operations forces may "conduct clandestine HUMINT operations . . . before publication" of a deployment order, rendering notification unnecessary. Pentagon lawyers also define the "war on terror" as ongoing, indefinite and global in scope. <b>That analysis effectively discards the limitation of the defense secretary's war powers to times and places of imminent combat.</b></p>

<p>Under Title 50, all departments of the executive branch are obliged to keep Congress "fully and currently informed of all intelligence activities." The law exempts "traditional . . . military activities" and their "routine support." Advisers said Rumsfeld, after requesting a fresh legal review by the Pentagon's general counsel, interprets "traditional" and "routine" more expansively than his predecessors.</p>

<p>"Operations the CIA runs have one set of restrictions and oversight, and the military has another," said a Republican member of Congress with a substantial role in national security oversight, declining to speak publicly against political allies. <b>"It sounds like there's an angle here of, 'Let's get around having any oversight by having the military do something that normally the [CIA] does, and not tell anybody.' That immediately raises all kinds of red flags for me. Why aren't they telling us?"</b></p>

	<h3 class="title">DOD Intel Unit Led & Staffed by Unqualified Personnel</h3>
	
	<p><i>Unbelievable: as though it weren't enough that Rummy's DOD has decided to set up its own human intelligence program to circumvent the CIA and Congressional oversight, it's also apparently decided to staff it with unqualified personnel and have it lead by a known liar with a history of deceiving Congress.  Even better, Colonel George Waldroup "is described by associates as a colorful Texan who refers to himself in the third person, as 'GW'", apparently reports to Lt. General William G. Boykin.  You may recall Boykin as the guy who stirred up controversy by telling a Bible study group that the US was engaged in a crusade against Islam.  Take these guys together with our former Attorney General, and it's obvious it's not just the tactics of these people that is decidedly Nazi-like, but their perverse personalities as well.  AG</i></p>

<p>Waldroup, according to two people who have worked with him, refers loosely to previous secret assignments but is not a graduate of the Army's Special Warfare Center or the CIA's Field Tradecraft Course for intelligence officers. Until last year, colleagues said, Waldroup managed the transportation and security of search teams seeking weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, arranging the convoys that took them in and out of their base near Baghdad International Airport.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> Internal Pentagon briefings describe Strategic Support Branch members as experienced intelligence professionals with specialized skills, "military operations backgrounds," and the training to "function in all environments under adverse conditions." But four special operations soldiers who provided information for this article, directly or through intermediaries, said those assigned to work with them included out-of-shape men in their fifties and recent college graduates on their first assignments.</p>

<p>"They arrived with shiny black kneepads and elbow pads, shiny black helmets," said one special forces officer who served with Waldroup's men in Iraq. "They brought M-4 rifles with all the accoutrements, scopes and high-end [satellite equipment] they didn't know how to use." An older member of Waldroup's staff "became an anchor because of his physical conditioning and his lack of knowledge of our tactics, techniques and procedures. The guy actually put us in danger." </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Waldroup spent most of his working life as a midlevel manager at the INS, where he became embroiled in accusations that he participated in deceiving a congressional delegation about staffing problems at Miami International Airport in June 1995. The Justice Department inspector general's office, which concluded its probe the following year, quoted in its report sworn statements from subordinates that Waldroup, then assistant district director for external affairs, helped orchestrate a temporary doubling of immigration screeners on the day of the visit, instructed subordinates not to discuss staff shortages and physically confronted a union leader to prevent him from reaching members of Congress. Waldroup told the investigators that he was following an order from a superior in Washington to withhold information.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Secret Special Ops Units Operating on US Soil</h3>
	
	<p><i>I guess it really shouldn't come as a surprise that secret military units are operating on US soil.  Nevertheless, this article is interesting in that it's the first public mention of such operations that I've seen.  In addition, there are a couple of things that really struck me about this article.  For one, there is the author's assertion that "A civil liberties advocate who was told about the program by a reporter said that he had no objections to the program as described to him because its scope appeared to be limited to supporting the counterterrorism efforts of civilian authorities."  Hmmm, so that would be a civil liberties advocate from DOD?  Then there are the unnamed officials who disputed the characterization of the program as "extra-legal", one of whom elaborated to say that "the units operated in the United States under 'special authority' from either the president or the secretary of defense."  I suppose that would be the same "special authority" that authorizes the torture of prisoners in violation of US law.  Depressing.  AG</i></p>

<p>Somewhere in the shadows of the White House and the Capitol this week, a small group of super-secret commandos stood ready with state-of-the-art weaponry to swing into action to protect the presidency, a task that has never been fully revealed before.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Knight-Ridder Analysis Finds US Losing Iraq War</h3>
	
	<p>The United States is steadily losing ground to the Iraqi insurgency, according to every key military yardstick.</p>

<p>A Knight Ridder analysis of U.S. government statistics shows that through all the major turning points that raised hopes of peace in Iraq, including the arrest of Saddam Hussein and the handover of sovereignty at the end of June, the insurgency, led mainly by Sunni Muslims, has become deadlier and more effective.</p>

<p>The analysis suggests that unless something dramatic changes - such as a newfound will by Iraqis to reject the insurgency or a large escalation of U.S. troop strength - the United States won't win the war. It's axiomatic among military thinkers that insurgencies are especially hard to defeat because the insurgents' goal isn't to win in a conventional sense but merely to survive until the will of the occupying power is sapped. Recent polls already suggest an erosion of support among Americans for the war. </p>

	<p>  A major bank in Chile reported yesterday that U.S. regulators are investigating whether its two branches in the United States have complied with anti-money-laundering laws.</p>

<p>The focus of the inquiry couldn't be learned. The name of the bank, Santiago-based Banco de Chile, surfaced recently in an inquiry by bank regulators and the Justice Department into possible money laundering by former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. The inquiry began as part of a criminal investigation of Pinochet's accounts at Riggs Bank in Washington. </p>

	<h3 class="title">No Foreign Observers to Monitor Iraq Vote</h3>
	
	<p> When 1 million Palestinians voted for a successor to Yasser Arafat, 800 international observers poured into the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to monitor the polling. Former president Jimmy Carter and former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt led one team. A former French prime minister led another, and there were two U.S. congressional delegations.</p>

<p>When 8 million Afghans voted in October, at least 122 international observers from across Europe and Asia monitored the presidential election -- and declared it an "orderly and transparent process." </p>

<p>But in Iraq, where 14 million people are eligible to vote, the elections next week may have only one outsider from the hastily organized International Mission for Iraqi Elections to evaluate the balloting. If reluctant governments change their minds at the last minute about letting their officials go to Iraq, a handful of others may show up. But, even then, none is likely to tour polling stations or to be publicly identified, mission and U.S. officials said.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Now, with the international mission largely on the outskirts of the elections, the balloting is already facing criticism. "Any attempt to present the elections as valid is an attempt to fool the world," Giulietto Chiesa, an Italian member of the European Parliament, told reporters after the EU decision not to send representatives to Iraq.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Defence spending by individual European countries, including the UK, France, and Germany, is likely to fall further behind China and other countries over the next 15 years. Collectively these countries will outspend all others except the US and possibly China.</p>

<p>The expected next technological revolution will involve the convergence of nano, bio, information and materials technology and will further bolster China and India�s prospects, the study predicts. Both countries are investing in basic research in these fields and are well placed to be leaders. But whereas the US will retain its overall lead, the report warns "Europe risks slipping behind Asia in some of these technologies". </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>The report also largely endorses forecasts that by 2020 China�s gross domestic product will exceed that of individual western economic powers except for the US. India�s GDP will have overtaken or be overtaking European economies.</p>

	<p><i>Couple of interesting points from this backgrounder article. Note the last bullet point.  Students of history will recall that by 1939 the Nazis were in a hurry to achieve their territorial aims with or without a major European war because they knew that if they waited more than a few years they would lose their technological edge and that their "war" economy would not be sustainable in the long term.  AG</i></p>

<ul>
<li> World military spending in 2003 increased by about 11 per cent in real terms. This is a remarkable rate of increase, even more so given that it was preceded by an increase of 6.5 per cent in 2002.</li>
<li>Over two years world military spending increased by 18 per cent in real terms, to reach $956 billion (in current dollars) in 2003.</li>
<li>The main reason for the increase in world military spending is the massive increase in the United States, which accounts for almost half of the world total. <--snip--> Much of the rise is accounted for by the large supplementary appropriations to cover the costs of the military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and of anti-terrorist activities. In the absence of these appropriations, US military expenditure would still show a significant increase, but at a much slower rate, and world military spending would show a rise of 4 per cent rather than 11 per cent in 2003.</li>
<li>While US military expenditure is set to continue to grow and will continue to propel world military spending, the pace is likely to fall back somewhat in the next few years. In the longer term it is doubtful whether current levels will be economically and politically sustainable.</li>

	<h3 class="title">Rising Tesnsions in Asia</h3>
	
	<p>The publication of Japan's new National Defense Program Outline, the first serious re-statement of Japan's security policing in a generation, declares the obvious: that Japan has to consider both China and North Korea as potential threats.<br />
    <br />
    North Korea's nuclear ambitions and its staging of missile test flights over Japanese territory would worry anybody, and China's costly re-armament program has the entire region nervous. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p> Japan's new program does not come right out and say that China's re-armament is aimed at deterring the U.S. Navy's aircraft carriers from coming anywhere near the Taiwan Straits, and thus strategically aimed at slowly but surely excluding the Americans from the Asian security equation. But why else would China be buying silent new submarines that can lie in wait for the carriers, or buying the long-range ship killing missiles and the Su-30 fighter-bombers to deliver them? </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>For the 15th year in a row, China's defense budget has again recorded double-digit growth, and while Beijing's official figures claim it spends a mere $26 billion a year, the U.S. estimates this year's spending at $55 billion, and possibly as high as $70 billion when including the space and satellite programs, "oceanographic research" and "security costs" for the National Oil Corporation. </p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>"Fundamentally, the Chinese buildup has been due to Taiwan's push for independence and the U.S. and Japan's direct and indirect backing of Taiwan," argues Shen Dingli of the Institute for International Studies at China's Fudan University. "Therefore, Japan has to be responsible for this and should not say China is the source of regional instability." </p>

	<p><i>Think "militarization of space".  AG</i></p>

<p>A European rocket roared into space from a pad in South America on Saturday, placing into orbit a surveillance satellite billed as giving France's military new abilities to spy worldwide.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p><br />
The Helios 2A military satellite, the rocket's main cargo, is to rotate in sun-synchronous orbit around 435 miles above the Earth, Arianespace said.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Helios 2A, weighing 4.6 tons, is said to be able to spot objects as small as a textbook anywhere on Earth.</p>

<p>Equipped with infrared sensors, it is expected to allow France's military to gather information at night from space for the first time.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Climate Change Backgrounder</h3>
	
	<p> In the four years since President Bush took office, scientific sleuths trying to understand the extent of global climate change -- and finger the culprits -- have come up with several important new clues:</p>

<p>� Glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and the fastest moving glacier in the world has doubled its speed. </p>

<p> � Worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than they did a decade ago, and animals are migrating toward cooler climates across the globe.</p>

<p>� The oceans have absorbed extra heat trapped in the atmosphere, which indicates Earth's temperature should rise by another degree Fahrenheit in the coming decades. </p>

	<p>Great background article on the sliding dollar from NYT.  AG</p>

<p>JUST what will the plummeting value of the dollar mean for the American economy? The answer is not quite as simple as "less imports, more exports." Depending on how investors behave, the dollar's downward drift could cast anything from a benign breeze to a hurricane.</p>

<p>If the dollar loses value slowly, giving businesses and investors plenty of time to adjust their spending and portfolios, the main effect may be to make the American economy more competitive. That would be a happy conclusion.</p>

<p>But if the dollar takes an abrupt dive, the consequences may be dire. Companies and consumers alike may find themselves stripped of purchasing power and ground down by sky-high interest rates.</p>

	<p><br />
TOKYO, Dec. 3 - As Americans embark on another season of debt-supported holiday spending, they might want to give thanks that Masatsugu Asakawa is still buying in America, too.</p>

<p>Mr. Asakawa, 46, is the top official at the Finance Ministry here responsible for managing the largest portfolio of United States government securities in the world, worth a staggering $720 billion. As the dollar has slumped this fall, many investors have started to worry that Mr. Asakawa and his counterparts elsewhere in Asia will be tempted to pare their holdings, perhaps causing the currency to plunge much further and setting off a round of interest rate increases in the United States that could send the global economy into a tailspin.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>In contrast to Japan, China's money managers, while selling little of their existing Treasury holding, have not been buying much more. China's foreign currency reserves rose by $111.3 billion in the first three quarters of the year, according to official Chinese data. But its Treasury holdings, American filings show, climbed by only $16.4 billion.</p>

<p>Instead, officials at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in Beijing have been seeking higher yields by plowing billions of dollars a month into bonds backed by mortgages on houses across the United States, according to bankers who help Beijing manage the money. By helping keep mortgage rates from rising, China has come to play an enormous and little-noticed role in sustaining the American housing boom. </p>

Russia's Putin Calls U.S. Policy 'Dictatorial'</h3>
	
	<p>The primeval struggle between great powers churns on despite Americans' blind obsession with their "war on terror".  AG</p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin (news - web sites) accused the United States on Friday of pursuing a dictatorial foreign policy and said mounting violence could derail progress toward bringing peace and democracy to Iraq (news - web sites).</p>

<p> Putin also criticized the West for setting double-standards on terrorism, pursuing Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan (news - web sites) and Iraq while giving refuge to "terrorists" demanding Chechnya (news - web sites)'s independence from Russia.</p>

<p>The Kremlin leader's tough remarks came on a visit to former Cold War ally India, where he and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh issued a joint call for greater cooperation in stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq.</p>

<p>Unilateralism increased risks that weapons of mass destruction might fall into the hands of terrorists, and would stoke regional conflicts, Putin said in a hard-hitting speech to an invited audience. </p>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin told a gathering of Russian military officers last Wednesday that his government is testing new missiles that "will be put in service within the next few years and, what is more, they will be developments of the kind that other nuclear powers do not and will not have," according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.</p>

<p>The Russian leader, who has previously stated that defeating terrorism fomented by the Chechnya rebellion was his top security concern, told the audience that "we will continue to persistently develop our armed forces on the whole, including its nuclear arsenal potential."</p>

It sorts your mail and totals your taxes. It cuts Social Security checks and counts the United States census. It runs space flights and monitors air traffic.

	<h3 class="title">Call for Australia to Broker a Sino-American Agreement on Taiwan</h3>
	
	<p><i>This is mostly a light background article on the cross-strait tensions, but gets pithy at the end.  I completely agree that we should hang Chen out to dry if he provokes conflict with his independence talk--or worse, actions.  AG</i></p>

<p>Here, then, is Australia's challenge - and its opportunity to fulfil Howard's objective for Australia to play its part in stabilising US-China relations. Simply, Australia should take advantage of the warmth between them to propose that the US and China negotiate an explicit agreement over the future of Taiwan.</p>

<p>A deal like this would not be as hard as it sounds. Both sides are committed to upholding the status quo over Taiwan. The risk of war arises because neither side really trusts the other to stick to that commitment. The US fears that China will try to compel reunification by force against the wishes of Taiwan's people. China fears that, if and when the crunch comes, the US will support Chen in moving Taiwan to full independence. In these situations, the potential for mistrust and misunderstanding can be reduced if both sides sit down together and clarify their aims and intentions.</p>

<p>The US would need to affirm that it would not support Taiwanese independence under any circumstances, and does support eventual peaceful reunification. Further - and here's the crunch - it would need to affirm the US would not provide military support to Taiwan in a conflict with China if that conflict was provoked by Taiwanese moves to independence. That seems a big step for the US, but in fact it goes no further than the Assistant Secretary of State, Jim Kelly, went in a statement to Congress last year.</p>

<p>China would need to affirm that it will not force Taiwan to reunify with the mainland as long as Taiwan does not take steps towards independence. It is hard to see what either side would have to lose by an agreement along these lines. And it would be a big boon to Taiwan as well. If Chen is sincere in saying that he does not intend to move Taiwan to independence, he has nothing to lose and a lot to gain by an agreement which reduces the risk of war.</p>

	<p><i>The emphasis below is mine, and IMO entirely warranted.  As a couple of my recent posts show, China (and I suspect Russia as well) sees the US misadventure in Iraq and its preoccupation with the so-called "war on terror" as a strategic golden opportunity.  AG</i></p>

<p>"As it looked towards the election, China was clearly heavily conflicted," says Adam Ward, a China specialist at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London.</p>

<p>"It was familiar with and had a good working relationship with George Bush, seeing him as a pragmatist who would use his influence to rein in Taiwanese independence forces ... but China also disapproves of the direction of US foreign policy under Bush; and yet the divisive and controversial nature of the Bush administration has <b>created opportunities for China to make diplomatic advances and build up its influence in Asia and elsewhere at America's expense," he says.</b></p>

<p>There are concerns though over just how much influence Bush has over Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian.</p>

<p>And the widely tipped candidate to be the new Chinese ambassador to Washington, foreign vice-minister Zhou Wenzhong, was busy recently reaffirming the government's line that it would go to war over Taiwan regardless of the consequences.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>Speaking in Beijing on Monday, Morgan Stanley's chief economist Stephen Roach laid out his predictions saying that he expected to see the risk of protectionism and the use of China as a scapegoat rise under Bush.</p>

<p>"As long as the Bush administration continues to refuse to accept responsibility for their reckless fiscal policy China should prepare for the likelihood trade frictions will intensify, largely because of actions in Washington," said Roach.</p>

I also wouldn't put it past Russia to put its strategic foot in the door by selling weapons to Venezuela--the whole chummy charade between the US and Russia is getting pretty worn IMO.   AG</p>

<p><b>Article One</b></p>

<p>The Minister of Defense for Colombia dismissed the idea of an arms race with Venezuela, after the announcement of President Hugo Chavez that Venezuela purchased a fleet of Russian helicopters in order to guard the Colombia-Venezuela border.  Uribe said that the limited resources of the Colombian military is currently being used to only to deal with the internal conflict Colombia is still involved in and not to enter into an arms race.</p>

<p><b>Article Two</b></p>

<p>Venezuela said Monday that its recent purchase of Russian attack helicopters was for weapons renewal instead of a regional arms race.</p>

<p>    The new helicopters will be used for border protection only, Defense Minister Jorge Garcia Carneiro told a press conference, apparently in response to allegations of Colombian Defense Minister Jorge Uribe that Venezuela is starting an arms race. </p>

	<h3 class="title">Pep Talk</h3>
	
	<p>Everybody can use a pep talk sometimes.  Much as I hate to admit it, I'm in need of one after last week's electoral debacle.  I'm definitely in the "anybody but Bush" crowd, which is why I supported Kerry.  Someone told me on November first to vote my conscience.  I told them I couldn't because Kucinich wasn't a candidate.</p>

<p>I hate to admit I need a pep talk because in the end Kerry's sorry ass sucked me in.  Watching him rub Jr.'s face on the debating carpet was oh-so satisfiying.  This studied cynic actually found a bit of hope in Kerry.  Ah, the naivete.  </p>

<p>Anyway, don't be misled by the title--<i><a href="http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/article_13427.shtml" target="_blank">Why Kerry Conceded Defeat despite Electoral Fraud</a></i>--of this commentary from AxisofLogic.com.  It won't tell you anything profound, or even necessarily factual.  But it might make you feel better.  It makes me feel better by reminding me that I always considered a successful Kerry candidacy nothing more than a breathing space in which to organize and prepare for the final onslaught of the religious extremists and warmongering technocrats of the Right.  So we won't get that small luxury... bummer.  AG</p>

	<h3 class="title">Argentina & China Get Cozy</h3>
	
	<p>According to this article, China is running around the world securing massive amounts of resources to fuel its economy well into the future, and doing it at seemingly generous terms for its partners.  Not only is it thereby securing the long-term survival of its capital industries (something America would know nothing about), but its also generating goodwill where people have few kind words for the U.S.  I just cannot understand why China is not front and center in every single foreign policy debate.  As dramatic and potentially dangerous as organized Islamic militants are, the threat they pose to our long term survival and prosperity is relatively small compared to a) the climate crisis and b) the China threat.  AG</p>

<p>Argentine Foreign Affairs Secretary Rafael Bielsa confirmed this Sunday significant Chinese investments in energy, railways and infrastructure, as well as South Korean financial support, the first credit since Argentina defaulted at the end of 2001.</p>

<p><--snip--></p>

<p>However Mr. Bielsa said that he was not allowed to talk about the package, which apparently involves 20 billion US dollars, since �its contents and timing are under exclusive management of President Kirchner�.</p>

<p>According to the Argentine press, 20 billion US dollars is a sum just short of the country�s annual budget and represent twenty times what the Kirchner administration was planning in capital investment. </p>

	<p>This was no US-led conspiracy, but the collapse of the Soviet Union was convenient for the US. The US conceived of itself as the Cold War's winner � and winners, it seems, make the rules.</p>

<p>The Iraq war proves this: a new American empire is asserting itself. The victor of the Cold War now expects other nations to indulge its philosophy of self-righteousness.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this type of old thinking breeds more crises than it can ever resolve. Indeed, unilateral policies can never succeed in a global world defined more and more by shared concerns rather than national interests.</p>

<p>So, 15 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world remains more in need of new thinking than ever. We need a new world order that benefits all, a global civil society that will help fight terrorism. We know that bombs and special operations alone will not make us safer, for we must fight the poverty that breeds terrorism. </p>

<p>The statements have also been included in a multimillion pound English High Court damages claim by Nguema against alleged coup mastermind Simon Mann and two of his companies, oil tycoon Eli Calil, London businessman Greg Wales and exiled opposition leader Severo Moto.</p>

<p>Former SAS soldier Mann was sentenced to seven years in jail in Zimbabwe last month for attempting to buy weapons that were allegedly to be used in the coup.</p>

<p>In the statements, Du Toit suggested that Nguema might have been killed during the alleged coup - and added that, should there be resistance, bloodshed would be inevitable.</p>

	<p>Great background article on the Pakistan-India stand-off.  The high point, though, has to be the first paragraph below.  AG</p>

<p>Higher spending on conventional weapons is designed to raise the threshold at which the use of nuclear weapons may be warranted. This serpentine logic permeates nuclear programmes globally and indicates why no �conventional dividend� ever occurs after a region has gone nuclear. They have to spend more on conventional weapons to raise the nuclear threshold and keep spending more on nuclear weapons so they can survive a first strike from the other side.</p>

<p>In a recent paper, David Albright and Kimberly Kramer of the Institute for Science and International Security estimate that Pakistan now has a nuclear stockpile of 55 to 90 warheads. India has only a slighter larger stockpile of between 55 and 110 warheads.</p>

<p>Until recently, the need for president's proteges to coordinate their actions with local parliaments has been explained with the fact that Russia is too large as a state and that it has too many governors. That is why it was considered difficult to fill in so many vacancies without the assistance from the regional elite. The reason, however, will become no longer relevant, in the event the second measure announced by Putin is executed. If the number of governors is cut to 30, the president will be able to handle the problem alone, without the regional authorities.</p>

	<p>Here's a little Saturday morning blood-boiler.  The article goes on to point out that not only are corporate profits and personal income "substantially higher" than in 2000, they are at record highs!!  Not only that, but "small guvmint" Bush has increased government spending by 1.5% of GDP as compared with historical averages, while tax revenues are at a 40-year low as a percentage of GDP.  When the history books get written, I hope they will recognize this as the wholesale looting that it is.  AG</p>

<p>Even after a year of solid economic growth and booming corporate profits, federal income tax revenues were lower in the fiscal year that just ended than in the year before President Bush took office, according to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p>

<p>In a sign that Mr. Bush's tax cuts have had a bigger impact on the federal deficit than administration officials have often suggested, personal and corporate income taxes are both lower than they were in 2000 even though personal income and corporate profits are both substantially higher.</p>

	<p>China said yesterday that it "strongly opposed" a weapons deal worth billions between Taiwan and the US, calling it a breach of a long-standing agreement between Beijing and Washington.</p>

<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan (&#23380;&#27849;) said that the US$18 billion package that includes anti-missile systems, planes and diesel-electric submarines sends "wrong signals to Taiwan."</p>

	<p>The Air Force Times flays Bush.  AG</p>

<p>John F. Kerry�s service in Vietnam and his postwar testimonials have been targeted all summer by Republican-funded critics and veterans groups � so much so that for several months they have obscured George W. Bush�s much-criticized Vietnam-era service in the National Guard. A renewed interest in Bush�s service raised by a critical CBS News report exploded in controversy over whether some recently unearthed Bush documents were actually forgeries.</p>

<p>From most accounts, Bush appears to have received preferential treatment to get into the Air National Guard and avoid the draft after he graduated from Yale University in 1968. He was initially regarded as a good pilot, but his performance faded over his final two years in the Guard and he was suspended from flight status. He did not fly for the remaining 18 months he served in the Guard, though he was obligated to do so. </p>

<p>Late Thursday, a Spanish judge recommended that U.S. regulators criminally charge Riggs (RIGS: news, chart, profile) and seven senior executives at the bank for allegedly hiding as much as $10.3 million in funds for Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator.</p>

	<p> The nation's top national bank regulator, John D. Hawke Jr., announced yesterday that he will step down when his term expires next month.</p>

<p>Hawke -- who recently has been under fire from Congress for his agency's oversight of scandal-riddled Riggs Bank -- was appointed comptroller of the currency by President Bill Clinton and then permitted to remain in the job by President Bush. He will depart Oct. 13 after nearly six years in the post. The announcement has been expected for months, congressional aides said. </p>

<p>Robert C. Roane, who spent his entire 25-year career at Riggs and ran its sister bank in London from 1995 through 1999, is the second Riggs executive to be suspended in connection with the multiple ongoing federal investigations of the bank's relationship with Pinochet and other diplomatic clients. </p>

	<h3 class="title">AIPAC Spy Case Revolves Around Intelligence on Iranian WMD</h3>
	
	<p>The article goes on to discuss how AIPAC financed an Alabamian Congressman to the tune of $400,000 to <i>beat another Democrat</i>.  According to that Democrat, "pro-Israel money won Davis the 2002 election. The congressman-turned-lobbyist said his main concern is that pro-Israel money tends to crowd out the voice of Arab countries, a result he said could eventually lead to more wars in the Middle East. " </p>

<p>One of our readers was trying to convince me that Iran is next on the Bushcons' agenda.  I can well believe it after reading a few articles on the spy case tonight.  AG</p>

<p>James Gordon Meek reports that both FBI investigations of leaks from the Pentagon concern in part secret US intelligence on Iranian weapons of mass destruction programs. The FBI suspects that this intelligence was leaked to AIPAC and the Israelis on the one hand, and to Ahmad Chalabi on the other. Chalabi in turn is suspected of passing the information on to Tehran, playing the role of double agent. Although the FBI seems to be keeping the two inquiries separate, there is strong circumstantial evidence that there was a behind-the-scenes connection between Chalabi and the Israelis. That is, the information circuit may have been ingrown among the Neoconservatives, the Israelis and Chalabi's people. </p>

<p>It should be noted that Chalabi, the Neoconservatives, and Israel's Likud Party were allied in wanting to get up a US war against Iraq. But they were divided on the next stage, which was to get Washington to attack Iran, as well. Chalabi hates Saddam, but as an Iraqi Shiite has strong ties to Tehran, so he was not actually on board with Stage Two, and may have helped derail it, for which he is now hated in some Neoconservative circles.</p>

	<p>To a certain extent this is a rehash of the CounterPunch article I posted the other day, but it's interesting for the sake of who's rehashing it, as well as where Buchanan thinks it's going: Iran.  Since 9/11 I have continually been surprised by how often I agree with Pat Buchanan.  AG</p>

<p>Washington today is rife with reports the FBI has been investigating whether or not a nest of Pollardites inside the Pentagon has been funneling secrets, through the Israeli lobby AIPAC, to the Reno Road embassy and on to Sharon.</p>

<p>Suspected mole Larry Franklin, a Pentagon Iranian analyst, was reportedly sighted trying to hand over to an AIPAC official a draft copy of a National Security Presidential Directive on Iran. With the mullahs apparently pursuing atomic bombs, Israel wants the United States to attack, denuclearize and bring down its No. 1 enemy, the regime in Tehran.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Fortune Write-up of The EG Coup Plot</h3>
	
	<p>Note the possible motive for the alleged coup attempt in this article.  AG</p>

<p>If all this sounds like the makings of a paperback thriller, that's hardly a coincidence. One of the alleged coup financiers was thriller author and former British politician Jeffrey Archer. Like Thatcher, Archer has denied involvement. But to Africa watchers the tale of treachery is closer to Danielle Steel, revolving around an ugly family feud raging within Obiang's palace. At stake is who will succeed the President after 25 years of iron rule. "These guys thought it was ripe for a coup, because there was nonstop squabbling in the family," says Vasset. Those eyeing the potential fortunes from the country's oilfields dread that Obiang might install his favored son, Teodorin, who owns a home in Los Angeles, where he started a music company, TNO Entertainment.</p>

<p>Thatcher, meanwhile, remains under house arrest. He faces up to 15 years in prison for breaking antimercenary laws. With U.S. officials scrutinizing oil companies and Obiang's palace still in turmoil, executives are hoping for more stability. "Almost anyone involved in business in Equatorial Guinea would prefer to see a different type of government," says Crispin Hawes, a risk consultant at the Eurasia Group in New York City. For now, however, that will have to wait. </p>

<p>Soon after arriving in Equatorial Guinea in 1991, the U.S. ambassador discovered an unusual arrangement involving the country's despotic president and the first successful oil company operating in the poor, West African nation.</p>

<p>Walter International Inc. was paying to send the president's son to study at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif., company employees told the ambassador, John E. Bennett. The staff of the Houston company told Bennett about the arrangement, grousing that the son was "spending at will," bringing the tab for a year in Southern California to at least $50,000, the former ambassador said. </p>

	<p>Bruce McColm is the expert that Riggs Bank CEO Lawrence I. Herbert consulted when he first heard--out of the blue, mind you--rumors that Obiang was corrupt.  But it turns our McColm and Obiang are business partners.  Herbert asserted in Senate testimony that he was unaware McColm did business with Obiang.  McColm says otherwise.  Of course, Herbert's testimony is ridiculous because according to the Senate Permanent Subcommitte on Investigation's report, Riggs bank was repeatedly cited for violations of Treasury Department rules for at least the past ten years.  AG</p>

<p> When Riggs Bank president and chief executive Lawrence I. Hebert learned of State Department reports and newspaper stories 18 months ago describing widespread corruption and human rights abuses by Equatorial Guinea's dictator, Hebert knew he needed "independent verification of what was going on in the country," he said at a Senate hearing last month.</p>

<p>The oil-rich West African country was Riggs's biggest depositor, with $700 million on deposit by 2003, some of it hauled $1 million at a time into Riggs's DuPont Circle branch in shrink-wrapped, 20-pound bundles. The published reports raised troubling claims that Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasago and his family might be skimming money illegally from the country's oil-revenue accounts at Riggs. </p>

	<p>In my opinion, the US is really playing with fire vis-a-vis fuelling the Asian arms race through Israel.  I think that someone--probably among the neo-cons--is attempting to maintain strategic balance between India and China by passing weapons systems to both parties through Israel.  I think the ultimate effect, however, will be to heat up Asia, increasing the risk of a major war there in the next decade or so.  Of course, since Muslims view both India and China as oppressors of Muslims and Muslim's eye Israel's relationship with India in particular with deepening suspicion, all of this has a complicating effect on US Middle East policy as well.  AG</p>

<p>ndia will be collaborating with Israel and the US to develop nano-materials and hi-tech components needed for electronic warfare systems.</p>

<p>Despite its fervent denials, Israel secretly maintains a large and active intelligence-gathering operation in the United States that has long attempted to recruit U.S. officials as spies and to procure classified documents, U.S. government officials said.</p>

<p>FBI and other counterespionage agents, in turn, have covertly followed, bugged and videotaped Israeli diplomats, intelligence officers and others in Washington, New York and elsewhere, the officials said. The FBI routinely watches many diplomats assigned to America.</p>

<p>Officials said FBI surveillance of a senior Israeli diplomat, who was the subject of an FBI inquiry in 1997-98, played a role in the latest probe into possible Israeli spying. The bureau now is investigating whether a Pentagon analyst or pro-Israel lobbyists provided Israel with a highly classified draft policy document. The document advocated support for Iranian dissidents, radio broadcasts into Iran and other efforts aimed at destabilizing the regime in Tehran, officials said this week.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Neo-cons Alleged to Have Spied for Israel for Decades</h3>
	
	<p>This is a serious must-read.  If the allegations made in this article are true then Douglas Feith, Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, along with a couple of their acolytes--essentially the core of the neo-con club within the US National Security/Defense community--should have all been behind bars a long time ago.  AG</p>

<p>Since 9-11, a small group of "neo-conservatives" in the Administration have effectively gutted--they would say reformed--traditional American foreign and security policy. Notable features of the new Bush doctrine include the pre-emptive use of unilateral force, and the undermining of the United Nations and the principle instruments and institutions of international law....all in the cause of fighting terrorism and promoting homeland security.</p>

<p>Some skeptics, noting the neo-cons' past academic and professional associations, writings and public utterances, have suggested that their underlying agenda is the alignment of U.S. foreign and security policies with those of Ariel Sharon and the Israeli right wing. The administration's new hard line on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict certainly suggests that, as perhaps does the destruction, with U.S. soldiers and funds, of the military capacity of Iraq, and the current belligerent neo-con campaign against the other two countries which constitute a remaining counterforce to Israeli military hegemony in the region--Iran and Syria.</p>

<p>Have the neo-conservatives--many of whom are senior officials in the Defense Department, National Security Council and Office of the Vice President--had dual agendas, while professing to work for the internal security of the United States against its terrorist enemies?</p>

<p>A review of the internal security backgrounds of some of the best known among them strongly suggests the answer.</p>

	<p>Another revelation in the ongoing global arms race, and another slip in the slide toward a global war.  I claim the latter not least because this is completely different from Israel, where they won't confirm or deny their nuclear capability: South Korea came out and admitted that they made near-bomb grade uranium by a process with no known civilian application.  This will be sure to show up the U.S. double standard on WMD like few other events have.  AG</p>

<p>  South Korean government scientists secretly enriched uranium to nearly bomb-grade levels in experiments conducted four years ago, officials in Seoul and Vienna acknowledged yesterday, as the International Atomic Energy Agency announced it had launched a major investigation of the country's programs and nuclear technologies.</p>

<p>U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the United States had begun a separate inquiry into whether the scientists involved had trained at U.S. nuclear facilities as part of friendly exchange programs and whether the technology may have come from the United States years ago. </p>

	<p> Riggs Banks investigators have found evidence of possible criminal activities by some former employees who managed the accounts of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and have referred their findings to federal prosecutors, according to several sources familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>The referrals emerged from an internal investigation of possible money laundering in Riggs's dealings with Pinochet and Chile going back to the mid-1980s, said the sources, who are familiar with the probe and spoke only on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still in its early stages. </p>

	<p>The article alleges that Mark Thatcher tried to hide payments for hiring the aircraft by chanelling through a company called Air Ambulance Africa.  There is also a story in the UK-based <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1241218,00.html">Times Online</a> that states the head of Air Ambulance Africa is cooperating with the SA inquiry (warning-a paying membership is required to read it).  AG</p>

<p>A small aviation company based in the Free State town of Bethlehem has emerged as central to the arrest of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher's son, Mark.</p>

<p>Mark Thatcher was arrested on Wednesday by the Scorpions for allegedly aiding the plot to overthrow the Equatorial Guinean government.</p>

<p>He faces charges under South Africa's Foreign Military Assistance Act for allegedly bankrolling the coup attempt to the tune of $275 000 (about R1,7-million), according to the Scorpions.</p>

<p>No further information about the allegations against Thatcher was released when the controversial Briton appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. He was released on R2-million bail.</p>

	<p>Holy crap!  I never would have believed that the foreknowledge idea was so widespread.  It's particularly shocking that nearly a third of Republican New Yorkers believe that US officials had foreknowledge of 9/11.  AG</p>

<p>On the eve of a Republican National Convention invoking 9/11 symbols, sound bytes and imagery, half (49.3%) of New York City residents and 41% of New York citizens overall say that some of our leaders "knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act," according to the poll conducted by Zogby International. The poll of New York residents was conducted from Tuesday August 24 through Thursday August 26, 2004. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of +/-3.5.</p>

<p>The poll is the first of its kind conducted in America that surveys attitudes regarding US government complicity in the 9/11 tragedy. Despite the acute legal and political implications of this accusation, nearly 30% of registered Republicans and over 38% of those who described themselves as "very conservative" supported the claim.</p>

<p>As a result, several areas of the case remain murky, the officials said. One main uncertainty is the legal status of Lawrence A. Franklin, the lower-level Pentagon policy analyst who the authorities believe passed the Israelis a draft presidential policy directive related to Iran.</p>

	<p>Falling oil output from ageing fields, once insignificant compared with global production, has become large enough to impact world supply and may help explain the constant tightness in the oil market this year, according to analysts.</p>

<p>Oil production is now in decline in at least 18 major producing countries including the U.S., U.K. and OPEC members Indonesia and Venezuela, and total production from this group is falling by around 1 million barrels a day every year, according to the latest data. </p>

<p>--snip--</p>

<p>"What it means is that before you meet a single barrel of demand growth you have to replace all the missing barrels," he continued. "Depletion is really an extra demand. Countries where oil production is still expanding are being put under increasing pressure to make up growing depletion rates. It's a huge drag on the system."</p>

	<p>The same thing that heppened to your steel industry.  Check out the fact that 20% of the undersea bandwidth out of the US is foreign-owned.  AG</p>

<p>Although carriers like Sprint, MCI, AT&T and Level 3 Communications still carry a big percentage of the world's Internet traffic, US carriers have lost their status as unassailable giants as more traffic is routed around them. Operators like T-Mobile of Germany, NTT of Japan, Telstra of Australia and France Telecom moved into the US market; Telmex, the Mexican phone company, snapped up AT&T's Latin American network and MCI's share of Embratel in Brazil; and Telmex's largest shareholder, Carlos Slim Helu, took strategic stakes in MCI and Global Crossing.</p>

<p>Other Asian carriers have suddenly become global or regional players by buying US assets. In December, a subsidiary of the government-controlled Singapore Technologies paid US$250 million to rescue Global Crossing, a bankrupt US-based company with a US$10 billion global fiber-optic network covering an estimated 20 percent of all undersea capacity leaving the US.</p>

<p>The investigation was detailed in a letter earlier this month from the U.S. attorney for the District to federal bank regulators, asking them to put on hold their own investigation into the bank and its directors and senior management "to avoid any potential adverse impact" on the Justice Department probe. A copy of the letter was obtained by The Washington Post. </p>

	<p>And in the other corner.... (see the NYT article I posted below).  This article takes the standard line when it comes to the high oil prices, but had the tidbit below and a couple of others I found interesting.  AG</p>

<p>Adjusting for inflation, the price of oil remains far below a 1981 peak, when the level was equivalent to more than $72 a barrel in today's dollars, said John C. Felmy, chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group based in Washington.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Times Article Claims Oil Shock Won't Hurt</h3>
	
	<p>I don't see anything to support the author's main two reasons why an oil shock won't hurt: a) that the economy is more fuel efficient and b) that high oil prices are not driving inflation.  With respect to a), he just thows it out there as a completely unsubstantiated claim.  With respect to b), he supports his claim by citing the percentage increase in prices since a year ago--but oil has only really soared in the last month or so.  So anyway, I think this article is hogwash, but I posted it a) so some day I can see that it was hogwash with 20/20 hindsight and b) because I hope somebody has an intelligent comment or link about this guy's claim that our economy is much more energy efficient now than it was a decade ago.  AG</p>

<p>How much will expensive oil hurt?</p>

<p>Over the last 30 years, the United States has been driven into recession three times by abrupt surges in the price of oil. As the price of crude has surged over the last two weeks, reaching new heights almost daily, some economists have begun to worry that the current "oil shock" will slam the brakes on the nation's economic expansion again.</p>

<p>It probably won't. Despite the disquieting parallels with the oil shocks of the 1970's, the 1980's and the 1990's, the impact of the current oil spike on the American economy is likely to be much less intense than in previous surges.</p>

	<p>The numbers of sufferers of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease, have soared across the West in less than 20 years, scientists have discovered.</p>

<p>The alarming rise, which includes figures showing rates of dementia have trebled in men, has been linked to rises in levels of pesticides, industrial effluents, domestic waste, car exhausts and other pollutants, says a report in the journal Public Health.</p>

<p>In the late 1970s, there were around 3,000 deaths a year from these conditions in England and Wales. By the late 1990s, there were 10,000. </p>

<p>--snip--</p>

<p>Pritchard's paper has been published amid growing fears about the chemical build-up in the environment. A number of studies have pointed to serious problems. TBT is being banned from marine paints after it was blamed for masculinising female molluscs, causing a dramatic decline in numbers. A US report linked neurological disorders to pesticides. And testing by WWF (formerly the World Wildlife Fund) found non-natural substances such as flame retardants in every person who took part.</p>

	<p>I don't necessarily buy ICP's main arguments for opposing the sale, namely that PNC engages in discriminatory and predatory lending.  I think they are irrelevent to the allegations that Riggs faces and the supporting points about discriminatory lending in particular are open to refutation because the protest does not address the credits of the minorities in question.  However, this article is full of interesting media references to both banks, including the excerpt below.  AG</p>

<p>Riggs National Corp., the embattled Washington banking company, did not sell to the highest bidder, according to a securities filing. Instead it chose PNC Financial Services Group over a bidder whose all-stock offer was valued about 4% higher than the winning $779 million cash and stock offer, PNC revealed Wednesday in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The filing detailed the sale agreement and the background to it. It said the board of the $6 billion-asset company chose PNC's offer because, among other things, it favored a buyer that had weathered regulatory issues of its own. It was also impressed by the speed of regulatory approval for PNC's latest acquisition... The filing also said that the other bidder had taken longer than PNC to close its recent acquisitions, and that regulatory approval of a deal with that bidder might have been more complex. Mr. Record said PNC's January purchase of United National Bancorp of Bridgewater, N.J., took less time than Sovereign's last four acquisitions. In addition, he noted, Sovereign is regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision and would have needed its approval to buy Riggs.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been questioning political demonstrators across the country, and in rare cases even subpoenaing them, in an aggressive effort to forestall what officials say could be violent and disruptive protests at the Republican National Convention in New York. </p>

<p>F.B.I. officials are urging agents to canvass their communities for information about planned disruptions aimed at the convention and other coming political events, and they say they have developed a list of people who they think may have information about possible violence. They say the inquiries, which began last month before the Democratic convention in Boston, are focused solely on possible crimes, not on dissent, at major political events.</p>

	<p>President George W. Bush has said that there will be a full investigation of suspect accounts formerly held by General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former dictator, at the Washington-based Riggs Bank.</p>

<p>"It's important for the facts to be en la mesa, as we say - on the table - and so that we know what course of action may or may not be needed," Bush said Monday after a meeting with President Ricardo Lagos of Chile. "The Riggs Bank is being fully investigated, and they'll be investigated in a very open way."</p>

	<p>PNC valued the acquisition at $779 million, including $321 million in cash and 7.5 million in PNC stock. </p>

<p>Riggs showed a profit of $3.9 million for the first three months of the year, compared with $5.9 million for the first quarter of 2003. The bank has about $6 billion in assets. PNC, by contrast, has quarterly earnings in the range of about $300 million, ten times the profits of Riggs on roughly the same amount of assets.</p>

<p>--snip--</p>

<p>Under terms of the agreement, each share of Riggs stock will be valued at $24.25, based on PNC's closing stock price of $51.70 on July 14. PNC said it hoped to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2005. </p>

<p>The merger is subject to regulatory approvals and the approval of shareholders. PNC said Joseph L. Allbritton, the major stockholder of Riggs and its former chairman and chief executive, has agreed to vote 24.6 a percent of the outstanding shares of Riggs in favor of the transaction.</p>

	<p>Riggs bank in the news--you may remember that this first appeared a few months back and it was mentioned that a Bush uncle is a senior executive at Riggs.  According to the report, Riggs was apparently involved in money laundering for Pinochet, Prince Bandar bin Sultan (Saudi ambassador to U.S. and Bush-buddy) and Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasago, the dictator of Equatorial Guinea.  The last of these was apparently taking up to $250,000 payoffs from American oil companies.  Note that the Times doesn't name the senior executive under grand jury investigation.  AG</p>

<p>The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has concluded that Riggs executives and bank regulators, even after the events of Sept. 11, 2001, failed to monitor suspicious financial transactions involving hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>A report it released last week in connection with a hearing on the bank's operations gives a detailed picture of events that snowballed into a financial scandal and appear to have ended the venerable bank's independence. On Friday, the parent of Riggs announced that PNC Financial Services of Pittsburgh had agreed to buy it for $779 million. Still, Riggs, and those who ran it, face more regulatory, Congressional and law enforcement investigations.</p>

<p>Its plans include setting up SWAT teams of specially trained lawyers, spokesmen and political experts to swoop into any state where a recount could be needed.</p>

<p>"The U.S. has had a policy of being able to fight two regional conflicts and still defend the homeland," said Marc E. Elias, the Kerry campaign's general counsel. "We want to be able to fight five statewide recounts and still have resources available to the campaign."</p>

<p>We're a nation of people who feel they should have it all now, regardless of the cost, and we have a lending community willing to give it to us, for as much as we are willing to go into debt. As suggested in earlier installments, <b>Americans are carrying at least 25 percent more debt than they did twenty five years ago, and 40 percent of that debt is now on an adjustable rate, for both credit cards and housing.</b></p>

<p>Further, the ability to leverage more has created a "Star Wars" escalation in demand for luxury, and therefore in housing costs, where buyers insist that even the most modest new homes be outfitted with granite countertops, jetted tubs, and other image-rich accoutrements. Home sizes have doubled over the last two generations, even while families have shrunk by an entire person (3.14 persons in 1970 VS 2.62 in 2000, according to the U.S. Census.) Who's paying for these McMansions, and what will happen to them if energy costs or job losses makes such large homes unsustainable? </p>

	<h3 class="title">US Job Growth of Poor Quality</h3>
	
	<p>Read it and weep.  AG</p>

<p>Nor is there much reason to celebrate the quality of the jobs that have been created over the past four months.  In scanning the detailed industry breakdown of this recent pick-up in job creation, the leading sources turn out to be restaurants, temporary hiring agencies, and building services.  Collectively, these three groupings, which comprise only 9.7% of total nonfarm payrolls, accounted for fully 25% of the cumulative growth in overall hiring from February to June 2004.  Moreover, hiring has accelerated in other industries at the low end of the job hierarchy � namely, clothing stores, couriers, hotels, grocery stores, trucking, hospitals, social work, business support, and personal and laundry services.  Collectively, this latter group of industries, which makes up 12% of the nonfarm workforce, accounted for another 19% of the total growth in business payrolls over the past four months.  Putting these segments together, low-end jobs accounted for about 44% of total hiring over the February to June interval, double their share in the workforce.  Consequently, to the extent there has been any improvement on the job front over the past four months, the impetus has been concentrated at the low end of the quality spectrum. </p>

	<p>If I haven't said it here before, I'm looking for a Eurasian economic & military bloc to form in opposition to US strategic interests.  AG</p>

<p>French President Jacques Chirac and visiting senior official of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Li Changchun, have vowed to join hands to boost the all-around strategic partnership between the two countries.</p>

<p>   China and France share same or similar stand on major international issues and the common interests have laid a solid foundation for the sound development of Sino-French ties in<br />
various fields, said Li, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, during a meeting with Chirac on Saturday.</p>

<p>   China is willing to make concerted efforts with France to push the Sino-French all-around strategic partnership to a new high, Li said.</p>

	<h3 class="title">US Intimidates China</h3>
	
	<p>Sorry for putting most of the article in the excerpt, but it's all so fascinating.  I hope that the phrase "the war" (emphasis mine below) indicates a momentary lapse of context by the writer, and not a foregone conclusion.  AG</p>

<p>In an exercise codenamed Operation Summer Pulse 04, it [the US] is expected to arrange for an unprecedented seven aircraft carrier strike groups (CSGs) to rendezvous in waters a safe distance away from the Chinese coastline - but still within striking distance - after mid-July.</p>

<p>---snip---</p>

<p> From past deployment patterns, the US usually despatches one CSG to a trouble spot as a reminder of its presence.</p>

<p>It did so several times in the past when tension was high in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

<p>It sends two to indicate serious concern, as was the case when China test-fired missiles over the strait in 1996.</p>

<p>In a combat situation, it deploys three to four, which was what it did in the Gulf War in the early 1990s and the recent Iraqi war.</p>

<p>But never before has it sent in peace time seven CSGs to the same theatre.</p>

<p>---snip---</p>

<p> 'Even now, China can easily take on two CSGs,' he said but conceded that there was no way it could face seven all at the same time.</p>

<p>This means that if China has to wage war over Taiwan, it has to be able to land and seize control of the island within the first 30 days.</p>

<p>Otherwise, under the FRP, six CSGs may well arrive to join in the battle.</p>

<p>'All this leaves China with no choice but to start and end <b>the war</b> with lightning speed,' said the source.</p>

<p>Politically, Summer Pulse is likely to be seen by many Chinese as naked intimidation.</p>

<p>'This is gunboat diplomacy in the 21st century,' the source remarked, adding that it would remind the Chinese people of their century-long deep humiliation by Western powers - and put Sino-US relations at peril.</p>

	<p>Great insights into the whole housing and housing lending market to be had here.  AG</p>

<p>By several measures, Americans are more indebted than ever. Through the first quarter, they owed nearly $9 trillion in home mortgages, car loans, credit card debt, home equity loans and other forms of personal borrowing � accumulating nearly 40 percent of this total in just four years, according to published Federal Reserve data. But most of the debt is at fixed interest rates. Thus it will be unaffected initially as the central bank begins its much expected quarter-point increases in the so-called federal funds rate, now at a 46-year low of 1 percent. The federal funds rate, in turn, influences the interest rate cost of most household and commercial debt.</p>

	<p>Wow pretty cynical all around.  AG</p>

<p>Kerry decided late Monday to cancel campaign stops in New Mexico scheduled for yesterday and flew back to the capital, arriving at a deserted Ronald Reagan National Airport at 2 a.m. The Massachusetts senator wanted to register his vote in support of an amendment that would have guaranteed federal funding for veterans' health care.</p>

<p>In the end, however, Kerry never got to vote. Republicans declined to bring the Democratic-sponsored amendment to the floor while the candidate was here. So Kerry hung around for a while but then headed back to the campaign trail. Meanwhile, Republicans were mulling what to do.</p>

<p>--snip--</p>

<p>According to an analysis by Congressional Quarterly -- which the Bush campaign pointed reporters to -- Kerry has missed 89 percent of the Senate's votes this year (14 of 132) as of Monday, and 64 percent last year. This included several votes on veterans' health care issues.</p>

<p>--snip--</p>

<p>In addition to the veterans issue, Kerry had another good reason to be in Washington yesterday. The Senate had its official photo taken in the chamber, and had Kerry missed it, he would have been the only absentee.</p>

<p>Oil execs argue that bigger means stronger. "Consolidation has given companies the financial strength and technological capabilities to take on bigger risks," says John Browne, CEO of BP, the former British Petroleum. Trouble is, there's little evidence that they're doing so. Far from raising money to pursue opportunities, <b>oil companies are paying down debt, buying back shares, and hoarding cash.</b> Exxon Mobil Corp., for instance, earned record profits in 2003 and ended the year with nearly $11 billion in cash. It then piled on an additional $5 billion in cash in the first three months of 2004.</p>

<p>Last February, two Army counterintelligence agents showed up at the University of Texas law school and demanded to see the roster from a conference on Islamic law held a few days earlier. Their reason: they were trying to track down students who the agents claimed had been asking "suspicious" questions. "I felt like I was in 'Law & Order'," said one student after being grilled by one of the agents. The incident provoked a brief campus uproar, and the Army later admitted the agents had exceeded their authority. But if the Pentagon has its way, the Army may not have to make such amends in the future. Without any public hearing or debate, NEWSWEEK has learned, Defense officials recently slipped a provision into a bill before Congress that could vastly expand the Pentagon's ability to gather intelligence inside the United States, including recruiting citizens as informants.</p>

	<h3 class="title">Who Controls Oil & Gas Leases of Public Land?</h3>
	
	<p>Now you know.  AG</p>

<p> Bureau officials say they have to rely on companies to provide accurate accounts of their holdings because the agency's computerized records do not track transfers of lease operating rights or the ownership of divided shares of leases.</p>

<p>The lax enforcement coincides with the Bush administration's push to open new public lands for oil and gas development. In March, bureau records showed 40 million acres of federal lands were under lease in the continental United States. That is 5.3 million more acres than when President Bush (news - web sites) took office.</p>

<p>Companies and individuals that dominate federal oil and gas leasing have been major financial supporters of Bush and the Republican Party. Since the 1999, the top 25 owners of federal oil and gas leases have directed 86 percent of their $8.2 million in political donations to the GOP.</p>

<p>Individuals and companies affiliated with the Yates family of Artesia, N.M., which is by far the biggest lease holder, have given $276,926 to GOP parties and candidates since 1999, and just $11,400 to Democrats. </p>

	<p>They're being really successful at keeping it out of the news here, but Saudi Arabia is practically in a state of civil war.  I wouldn't be surprised if instead of invading Syria or Iran, the US next occupies Saudi Arabia in order to secure the oil.  AG</p>

<p>(CNN) -- Rescue helicopters carrying Saudi security forces dropped them off on the roof of a building Sunday at a residential complex in Khobar where hostages -- perhaps about 50 -- have been held by gunmen since Saturday.</p>

<p>The U.S. State Department said one American was among the 11 people killed during the attack spree by suspected Islamic militants, and Western diplomatic sources said a British citizen also died.</p>

<p>Reports of the number of hostages being held ranged from 20 to 50 or more, with Saudi officials only saying there were "many."</p>

<p>But there are also domestic concerns. Mai Yamani, an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, says that political tension, rising violence and divisions among the princes of the ruling House of Saud, means that the country is in "chaos".</p>

<p><b>"Certainly the violence is going to increase ... It is the beginning of the end [for the regime]," Dr Yamani said.</b></p>

<p>Robert Baer, a former CIA officer, is convinced that the kingdom's vast oil infrastructure is vulnerable, and with it the Western economy.</p>

<p>In his recent book, Sleeping with the Devil, he writes that "taking down Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure is like spearing fish in a barrel".</p>

<p>The kingdom has five giant fields connected by 10,500 miles of pipe work, most of it above ground. According to Mr Baer, <b>a co-ordinated assault on five or more key junctions in the system could put the Saudis out of the oil business for two years.</b></p>

<p>But the broader possibilities are disturbing. Inuit hunters are falling more frequently through the thinning ice and habitats for plants and animals are also disrupted. The icy Hudson Bay in Canada could be uninhabitable for polar bears within just 20 years.</p>

Well, call me a paranoid, but that sure sounds like the old bait'n'switch if you ask me, given that Rigg's bank is apparently up to its elbows in Western African dictators and oil companies.  AG</p>

<p>Investigators are trying to determine whether oil companies paid prices so far above the market rates that they violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies from bribing foreign government officials, sources told The Times.</p>

<p>Marathon Oil Corp. and ExxonMobil Corp. confirmed that company officials had met with Senate investigators, but would not provide details. Both firms said their dealings in Equatorial Guinea had been proper and lawful.</p>

<p>Interest in the land deals grew out of a money-laundering inquiry involving accounts held by Equatorial Guinea at Riggs Bank in Washington. The biggest account contained hundreds of millions of dollars in oil revenues deposited by American oil companies operating in the country.</p>

	<p>This incredibly informative essay.  AG</p>

<p>CALLER -Does the Federal Reserve regulate the value of Federal Reserve Notes and interest rates?</p>

<p>MR. SUPINSKI - Yes</p>

<p>CALLER - Explain how the Federal Reserve System can be Constitutional if, only the Congress of the US, which comprises of the Senate and the House of Representatives has the power to coin and issue our money supply and regulate the value thereof? [Article 1 Section 1 and Section 8]  Nowhere, in the Constitution does it give Congress the power or authority to transfer any powers granted under the Constitution to a private corporation or, does it?</p>

<p>MR. SUPINSKI - I am not an expert on constitutional law.  I can refer you to our legal department.</p>

<p>CALLER - I can tell you I have read the Constitution.  It does NOT provide that any power granted can be transferred to a private corporation.  Doesn�t it specifically state, all other powers not granted are reserved to the States and to the citizens?  Does that mean to a private corporation?</p>

<p>MR. SUPINSKI - I don�t think so, but we were created by Congress.</p>

<p>The original Stockholders of the Federal Reserve Banks in 1913 were the <b>Rockefeller�s, JP Morgan, Rothschild�s, Lazard Freres, Schoellkopf, Kuhn-Loeb, Warburgs, Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs.</b>  The MONEYCHANGERS wanted to be insured they had a monopoly over our money supply, so Congress passed into law Title 12, Section 284 of the United States Code. Section 284 specifically states, �NO STOCK ALLOWED TO THE US.�</p>

	<p>If you ask me, this is just one more step in the accelerating international arms race.  Quite aside from the destabilizing effect of the US abandoning yet another international agreement that it was one of the architects of, you have to ask yourself how hard it would be to develop the pathogens as part of a "defensive" program while another department develops the delivery systems that would allow us to instantly go offensive with the germs.  AG</p>

<p>Arms control advocates are warning the Bush administration that proposed research for a new Homeland Security center may violate an international ban on biological weapons and encourage other countries to follow.</p>

<p>In a statement posted on the Internet, three arms control experts say proposals for the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, established by Congress last year, appear to flout the prohibition on development of bioweapons.</p>

<p>"The rapidity of elaboration of American biodefense programs, their ambition and administrative aggressiveness and the degree to which they push against the prohibitions of the Biological Weapons Convention are startling," the authors said.</p>

<p>Bush also proposed halving this year's huge deficit � expected to exceed $400 billion � in five years. The congressional plan achieves that goal, but partly because its tax cuts would last only for one year.</p>

<p>The budget also:</p>

<p>_Meets Bush's request of $421 billion for defense, 7 percent over this year. There is another $50 billion for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, of which Bush has so far requested half;</p>

<p>_Increases domestic security by 15 percent to $31 billion, while holding remaining domestic programs to $369 billion, $2 billion over this year.</p>

<p>_Drops earlier House plans to pare $13 billion in savings from benefit programs like Medicaid over the next five years.</p>

<p>_Means that, upon completion by both chambers, the House is considered to have approved a needed $690 billion increase in the federal debt limit to $8.1 trillion. The Senate must conduct a separate vote.</p>

	<p>''For a long time, the United States has employed a policy of de facto exceptionalism, simply ignoring international treaties and international law when it is convenient for purposes of its international policy or that of its favoured allies,'' said Mark Lance, associate professor of philosophy, justice and peace at Georgetown University.</p>

<p>''We saw this very clearly in Vietnam, in the many crimes committed by and supported by the U.S. administration (of former President Ronald Reagan, 1981-89) in Latin America, in U.S. support for Israeli crimes and in support of Indonesian genocide in East Timor, and many other examples,'' he added.</p>

<p>What is new, Lance added, is Washington's willingness to be explicit about this. ''The Bush administration says openly that international law, and international institutions, do not apply to the United States, or apply in different ways than they do to other countries.''</p>
