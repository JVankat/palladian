      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm not sure you get it,&quot; Margaret said 
      to Bodger after they had been talking in his office for a while.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was in her second year in the Modern 
      Languages Department.&nbsp; Bodger was nearing the end of his presidency.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came to the college fresh from her 
      Ph.D. program in New England, just about thirty. Like others recently 
      hired, she had a refreshing interest in the practice of teaching.&nbsp; It 
      separated her from her older colleagues, who thought that teaching was a 
      gift, not an acquired skill, and not to be spoiled by conscious meddling 
      in methodology.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger had suggested, ever so gently, 
      that some critical distance helps a faculty member get through to the 
      students.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I want to get CLOSE to the students,&quot; 
      she said, &quot;not put distance between us.&nbsp; They can hear my voice, 
      generationally, I think.&nbsp; Feel it.&nbsp; That's important.&nbsp; I could reach them 
      as a teaching assistant in grad school.&nbsp; It carries over now.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I understand--been there,&quot; Bodger said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her skeptical glance invited him onward.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When I came here to teach,&quot; Bodger said, 
      &quot;I was nearing my mid-thirties.&nbsp; I never had taught a college course in my 
      life.&nbsp; I did not have a doctorate to mask my inadequacies.&nbsp; I was thrown 
      in with an English department made up substantially of people I had 
      studied under as an undergraduate.&nbsp; This led to cross currents of 
      deference and outrageous rebellion, all unspoken and unseen by them.&nbsp; 
      Since I had no professional allegiance to an objective body of knowledge, 
      I was free to align myself with the students as SELVES.&nbsp; I don't think my 
      department chairman--my former teacher--suspected the disloyalty to the 
      discipline that this represented.&nbsp; But I was teaching freshman composition 
      anyway; nobody really cared what you taught as long as the students 
      practiced writing.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret, Ph.D., looked slightly puzzled 
      at Bodger through her round glasses.&nbsp; He understood that his sense of 
      getting close to students and hers were not precisely the same.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I could not be that cavalier,&quot; she 
      said.&nbsp; &quot;Syllabi have to be handed in.&nbsp; Students need evaluation.&nbsp; They 
      have to prepare for a general examination.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I know,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; &quot;I was not 
      overtly accountable to anyone but myself in class.&nbsp; The department head, 
      the president, and colleagues all made an unspoken assumption.&nbsp; It 
      permeated the entire college then.&nbsp; That was long before we put in a 
      formal faculty development program, with deans and department heads 
      hovering over syllabi and doing performance evaluations.&nbsp; That only 
      happened after I was president.&nbsp; In those old days, people made the grand 
      assumption that each faculty member could be depended upon to do the right 
      thing.&nbsp; Without that, I never could have given the self-referential spin 
      to teaching that I gave.&nbsp; No one checked on anyone else, at least not 
      bureaucratically or formally.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My own needs were mixed up in this.&nbsp; I 
      over-prepared and studied hard to stay ahead of the students; but it all 
      had to do with my own self as much as theirs.&nbsp; It was important to me to 
      tell them that THEY and not the books they were reading held first place 
      in the priorities.&nbsp; Looking back, I am not comfortable with the emphasis I 
      felt compelled to give the students.&nbsp; Undergraduates have always been 
      preoccupied with themselves anyway.&nbsp; The quest for self was something that 
      was more important to me, probably, than it was to them.&nbsp; It was something 
      I should have completed long before I got there, perhaps.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One year I devised the 'yellow paper 
      project' to give structure to this insistence.&nbsp; The essence of it was that 
      yellow tablet paper liberated the students to say anything they wanted to 
      say.&nbsp; There was a contract.&nbsp; I would read their yellow papers but never 
      say anything judgmental about what they wrote.&nbsp; The mere fact that they 
      wrote knowing I would be their audience was powerful.&nbsp; Naively, they wrote 
      of private things.&nbsp; They were quite open.&nbsp; I never violated the contract.&nbsp; 
      I learned about drugs on campus, loves and losses and cheats and youthful 
      dreams of fame and fortune.&nbsp; The contract allowed me to respond as I 
      wished to their submissions, as long as my responses supported them or 
      added something substantive.&nbsp; So I got close to the students; but the 
      medium of the yellow paper gave us both some space between.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;Yes, I see. It made 
      students very vulnerable.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It made me vulnerable too.&nbsp; To them.&nbsp; 
      And to my colleagues, who mostly ignored my experiment.&nbsp; Even after it 
      received some notice in the <i>College English</i> journal.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret asked if Bodger thought he 
      really taught them anything in this way.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was not the only thing I did with a 
      class, of course.&nbsp; But, yes.&nbsp; You always teach something with half an 
      effort, although you don't always know what it is they're learning.&nbsp; I am 
      sure they learned that words on paper can matter to one in a personal 
      way.&nbsp; Frankly, that was enough for me in one small comp course on a small 
      campus hidden away in a small town.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Cool,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After she left his office, Bodger tried 
      to put a definition to &quot;cool.&quot;&nbsp; He failed.&nbsp; He guessed it affirmed 
      something he had said; what it was affirming, however, escaped him.&nbsp; Given 
      the difference in their ages and in their generational markers, Bodger 
      realized that Margaret and he had at best an approximate sense of living 
      on common ground.&nbsp; Yet their occasional conversations continued after he 
      was out of office.&nbsp;&nbsp; She lacked the unvarnished curiosity of Michael about 
      Bodger.&nbsp; But Margaret kept coming back to him.&nbsp; She was rather like a 
      tongue drawn to a missing filling in a molar.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Months later, after he left office, 
      Bodger leafed through his journal for something he said to himself in 1973 
      about his teaching.&nbsp; He wanted Margaret to see it.&nbsp;&nbsp; When she came to his 
      new office away from the main campus, he gave it to her to read.&nbsp; It was 
      written on yellow tablet paper with the old manual typewriter now 
      prominently situated on his new desk.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; June 4, 1973: Yesterday the president 
      announced at commencement that I was one of two recipients of the Lindback 
      Award for Excellence in Teaching.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reviewing all the reasons why I 
      should not have received it, and all the bad reasons why I did receive it, 
      I am left to poke around in the residue of possible merit in my teaching.&nbsp; 
      It is for me an added thing, tacked on to the end of my days, knitted and 
      mended late at night and displayed--with no time to correct slips of the 
      needles--at nine the next morning.&nbsp; But it is also my link with 
      authenticity, my opportunity, three times a week, to deal with things as 
      they are and not the way I must push them into being.&nbsp; Hence it is a 
      seemingly unimportant segment of my life, which has in fact great 
      importance.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A scholar I am not.&nbsp; The unhurried, 
      ordered marshalling of information around common themes is a luxury I 
      cannot afford.&nbsp; I'm not even sure that, if I could afford it, I would know 
      what to do with it.&nbsp; My preparation for class is a combination of 
      long-remembered postures, of hastily gathered information, and of 
      overriding desire to Face the Fact, to cut out all the bull shit and get 
      down to It.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My skill, if any, lies in the ability 
      I have to be in the classroom and to preserve it and mock it at the same 
      time.&nbsp; The classroom is a mortuary, which is in search of a live body.&nbsp; To 
      provide even a half-live body is an accomplishment, I think, and to stir 
      even a few minds to look at things as they are is &quot;excellence,&quot; perhaps.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am sixty-five, I suppose I 
      still will be a smart-ass kid who can't stand the stuffy atmosphere of the 
      established way of doing things.&nbsp; I remember when I was about to be 
      graduated from eighth grade at Mont Clare School.&nbsp; I was the Legion Award 
      winner, a big cheese identified by the Big Cheese for future Big Cheeseism.&nbsp; 
      I distinctly remember blowing away at least part of the glory by tearing 
      up all my art papers for the year and throwing them all over the front 
      lawn of the school.&nbsp; To be straight is to be dead.&nbsp; I recall that the 
      principal, Raymond Spaid, withheld another special award that I would 
      naturally have received if I had not chosen or been compelled to stick my 
      fingers up to my nose.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the kind of person it is who 
      has been named Lindback Award winner this year.&nbsp; Dangerous business.&nbsp; </i>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Real cool,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger reconsidered whether Margaret's 
      usage of &quot;cool&quot; was affirming anything.&nbsp; But she continued to draw him out 
      in their occasional chats.&nbsp; Bodger sometimes felt that her interest was 
      that which she might bring to an Andy Warhol lithograph: she liked the 
      feeling you get when you run your eye over smooth surfaces that don't 
      connect to anything else.&nbsp; For her their talks may have been like a 
      recreational drug, fun for the moment and forgotten the next.&nbsp; Whatever 
      the reason, Margaret sustained her interest in his apprenticeship years at 
      the college.&nbsp; It gave Bodger's memories a focus on that time of tumult and 
      exhilaration.&nbsp; He was in the very midst of it before he was conscious of a 
      deliberate process of preparation.&nbsp; It was one thing for him to be 
      grabbing indiscriminately for new experience--to be developing himself out 
      of instinct.&nbsp; It was another to be the object of an agenda, raw 
      material--in his own hands, in the hands of D.L. Helfferich, or both.&nbsp; 
      Yes, both.&nbsp; Margaret over time may have devised a game of making that 
      distinction, but she did not tell Bodger.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, she had a particular reason to 
      draw him out. He went to the 800s in the library stacks in search of a 
      book on Kurt Vonnegut.&nbsp; There he saw Margaret, squatting on the floor, 
      head tilted, studying the titles on the book spines on the lowest shelf.
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I was thinking about you the other 
      day,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;I was trying to tell my class about the feelings at 
      colleges when Kent State happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about five years old at the 
      time.&nbsp; I only remember the pictures in the papers and vaguely see scenes 
      on the screen in my memory.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Take them out to the main gate and look 
      in toward the campus,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; &quot;Look to your left, at about ten 
      o'clock.&nbsp; You'll see a maple tree.&nbsp; It's twenty-five years old.&nbsp; Students 
      and the president planted it to mark the moratorium against the war.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It sounds pretty tame,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Planting the tree was the alternative 
      the administration put in front of the students.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some wanted to close 
      the college.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And they bought the alternative?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;After much talk and persuasion.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;By you?&nbsp; Were you president?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not yet.&nbsp; President's helper.&nbsp; In charge 
      of whatever the president wanted me to be in charge of.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, yes, I did a 
      lot of the talking with the students about the moratorium in the fall of 
      '69.&nbsp; The talking was even more intense when guardsmen shot students on 
      the Kent State campus in the spring of '70.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Tell me more,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger agreed to meet Margaret in the 
      chapel some days later.&nbsp; She wanted him to remember more about his 
      involvement in campus affairs in those times.&nbsp; Beforehand, Bodger sat in 
      his study at home and tried to recall specifics of those troubled years of 
      the '60s and early '70s.&nbsp; He did not feel confident that he could describe 
      it so that Margaret could make sense of it.&nbsp; He had to do some 
      reconstructing ahead of time.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>A sense of vocation led Bodger back to the 
      college</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger arrived at the college in 1965 
      with a sense of life as a vocation.&nbsp; It was grounded in the Germanic work 
      ethic of his family.&nbsp; Only in retrospect, after he was grown, did he see 
      the relentlessness of his mother's pressure on him to achieve.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      beauty of her project, he realized after she was gone, lay in her neglect 
      of WHAT he should achieve.&nbsp; He never felt inhibited by her in pursuing his 
      secret ambition to write a great novel or to publish the greatest poetry.&nbsp; 
      She did not say, &quot;Become a great doctor!&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;Become a college 
      professor!&quot;&nbsp; Without being fully conscious of doing so and without ever 
      saying it explicitly, she said, &quot;Become!&quot;&nbsp; She taught him to fear 
      indolence, lack of purpose.&nbsp; She never went beyond high school and spent 
      her whole adult life as a housewife and mother.&nbsp; She read <i>The Reader's 
      Digest</i> for serious fare.&nbsp; But her mind flew.&nbsp; Her handwriting seemed 
      to take wings across a piece of paper, skipping the leaden weight of 
      careful grammatical structure.&nbsp; He could feel her nervous energy whenever 
      he was in the heat of a creative task.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quick energy of his mother contrasted 
      with the passive place of his father in his young life.&nbsp; His father would 
      get up and go to work at the steel factory and come home and fix the house 
      and smoke his cigar and talk little and go to bed so that he could get up 
      before dawn for the next day's work.&nbsp; His father and Bodger had an 
      arms-length relationship.&nbsp; Yet he was a Large Presence in Bodger's life.&nbsp; 
      Bodger feared him because of what he did not do but could.&nbsp; In a day when 
      children were still routinely beaten &quot;for their own good&quot; by loving 
      parents, his father never put a hand on him.&nbsp; But Bodger always knew he 
      could.&nbsp; And he kept a safe distance from him.&nbsp; In the end, his father's 
      presence complemented the forceful messages implanted by Bodger's mother.&nbsp; 
      Work! Become! Be good!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he read in college about the grand 
      ambitions of the major writers, they enriched this ingrained disposition.&nbsp; 
      The Romantic greats--Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, 
      Keats--attracted him with their combination of revolutionary impulse and 
      heroic scope.&nbsp; The high Victorians and major modern Americans deepened the 
      feeling that he had a vocation to discover.&nbsp; He thought it was to be found 
      in creative writing, because his teachers said he knew how to write a 
      sentence.&nbsp; For a while, the texture of the prose of Fitzgerald and 
      Hemingway seemed to him to have grown out of the shape of his own 
      feelings.&nbsp; He was slow to set aside that conceit.&nbsp; He had to learn bit by 
      bit that his vocation would be the utilization of his gifts--writing among 
      them, certainly--in pursuit of&nbsp; organizational imperatives.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That realization blossomed only after he 
      went through a decade of corporate servitude following the Army and Penn 
      graduate school.&nbsp; During that time, he experienced the superficial 
      satisfaction of shaping events in the company through the printed word.&nbsp; 
      He also experienced the pleasure of shaping a good piece of prose for its 
      own sake, even when the content was the trivia of company affairs.&nbsp; And he 
      learned the rhetoric of management relationships in an environment of 
      masculine camaraderie.&nbsp; He discovered a knack for knowing the flow of a 
      deliberation and riding it just ahead of the others while making them feel 
      good.&nbsp; He thought of it as gamesmanship of a kind; but he felt too that it 
      had something to do with his private need to discover vocation, to give 
      himself over to something large.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After arriving in the college setting in 
      1965, Bodger closed some of the distance between his public life on the 
      job and the private world of his ambitions. The college was a more 
      congenial setting for the merging of his public and private zones.&nbsp; If he 
      had revealed the extent of his sense of vocation in the conventionalized 
      setting of the company, he had feared that his superiors would label him 
      &quot;weird.&quot;&nbsp; Still, after moving to the college, he felt that he had to 
      retain a guardedness about himself when talking with the college president 
      and with his colleagues.&nbsp; He still feared that they would think he was odd 
      if they knew the whole truth about him.&nbsp; In worst moments, this made him 
      feel like an out-and-out paranoid.&nbsp; It lent a tone of duplicity to the way 
      he envisioned himself in action.&nbsp; He felt that he was not leveling with 
      those with whom he worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; He felt devious and vaguely guilty.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he read his journal entries from the 
      first couple of years after coming to work at the college, the high 
      seriousness of it all made him chuckle.&nbsp; He saw there the thinnest wisp of 
      a reminder that he had once immersed himself in the hyperbolic psyches of 
      F. Scott Fitzgerald's romantic young heroes. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17 Sep 1966: A fatality [sic] grows 
      upon me.&nbsp; This is all there is to do and it will take all of me and the 
      outcome is not as important as the absorption in the process.&nbsp; It is a 
      joyful sinking, a dread irresponsibility, an inescapable contract with 
      that in me which has the most value.&nbsp; Above all, it is all risk, and there 
      is the likely chance of utter failure but it doesn't matter: that's the 
      joyful part.&nbsp; It doesn't matter.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24 August 1967:&nbsp; I believe I have 
      seen the transformation of my youthful neurotic anarchism into a useful 
      social agent.&nbsp; There has always been a tension between the wish to rebel, 
      to make the old bastards look out the back window and gasp at the field we 
      set on fire, and the opposite craving to be accepted without ridicule, 
      embarrassment.&nbsp; I had long assumed that the two desires were mutually 
      exclusive.&nbsp; Now I see they are not.&nbsp; I am paid to rebel against what has 
      been, and my judgment as to the best method of rebellion for the whole 
      institution is respected, if not always accepted.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26 January 1969: The real thing is 
      always the same for me, and always will be, I guess--the fatal fascination 
      at the conflict between myself and the social Other.&nbsp; The validation of 
      myself for deep unexplained reasons hinges still on daring to oppose the 
      Other while being OF the Other.&nbsp; This may be heroism but quite possibly 
      instead may be hypocrisy or cowardice: lacking in guts to state your 
      position unequivocally.&nbsp; The private business between me and Chaos, or 
      Karma, or God if you will, seems submerged under that great social 
      conflict--or seems maybe to be contingent upon it.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I manifest the great American dream 
      of being suicidally involved and of saving myself by total sudden escape 
      someday. </i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a funny innocent!&nbsp; &quot;A good 
      thing I hid some of me from DLH and the rest,&quot; he said to himself.&nbsp; His 
      struggle for self-understanding in the heat of action lay now in a past 
      for which he felt only marginally accountable.&nbsp; DLH was gone from the 
      earth, with many others.&nbsp; Bodger himself in retirement was no longer the 
      object of public scrutiny.&nbsp; For Margaret, he was doubtless an historical 
      artifact, worthy of a small curiosity.&nbsp; He could talk freely to her now 
      with impunity.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>A presidential apprentice learned in the 
      unrest of the '60s</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret and Bodger sat alone in the 
      balcony of the empty Bomberger memorial chapel.&nbsp; The large overhead 
      chandelier lights were dark.&nbsp; The afternoon sun coming through the massive 
      stained glass window in the rear cast their figures in a soft pink light.&nbsp; 
      The founding president of the college, for whom the chapel was named, 
      looked out from his prominently placed portrait, vintage 1890.&nbsp; Enclosed 
      with Margaret and Bodger in the afternoon light, he mutely watched them 
      talk.&nbsp; The great white forked beard seemed to be the most important thing 
      about him.&nbsp; To Bodger the portrait was a happy combination of historical 
      pastiche and venerable icon.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This whole thing started because 
      Bomberger and his crowd BELIEVED,&quot; Bodger said, pointing to the portrait.&nbsp; 
      &quot;Believed in a way I can't adequately grasp.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">Margaret replied, &quot;But he 
      wouldn't grasp your way either, or mine.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger thought a moment.&nbsp; &quot;True enough.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Belief in a different sense,&quot; said 
      Margaret, thinking probably of herself as much as of Bodger.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I suppose the '60s could be cast in 
      terms of a sense of belief,&quot; said Bodger, not having thought of it that 
      way himself.&nbsp; &quot;In those years, through all the hype and gamesmanship, some 
      basic questions of belief were at stake in our lives.&nbsp; I was contending in 
      two different confrontations of belief, I guess.&nbsp; One was with the 
      students.&nbsp; The other was with my superiors in the administration.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I came to work at the college somewhat 
      blindly.&nbsp; I was getting away from the way the corporate life squeezed you 
      into a small package of efficiency and left the rest of you to dry up.&nbsp; 
      That was clear.&nbsp; I didn't have clearly in focus what I was getting <i>into</i>.&nbsp; 
      I spent the first couple of years here finding that out.&nbsp; The pace of my 
      life was so fast that I was finding it out on the run, in the heat of the 
      conflict.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Conflict with students?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was discovering an accord with 
      students more than conflict.&nbsp; The conflict was more with my elders.&nbsp; And 
      with my own ambitions.&nbsp; I had a sense of vocation.&nbsp; That is, I felt I had 
      to use myself up in a great worthwhile endeavor.&nbsp; But I was unclear about 
      the particulars.&nbsp; It was an attitude ingrained in me from childhood.&nbsp; I 
      always imagined myself as a writer--that would be the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; But by the 
      time I got here, I had developed an organizational talent.&nbsp; I could 
      harness my writing to the function of the company.&nbsp; I had learned to write 
      my way into an understanding of an organizational situation.&nbsp; Then I would 
      use that piece of writing to make something happen in the organization.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Before leaving the company, I wrote a 
      question-and-answer piece for the general manager on labor negotiations 
      for our company magazine.&nbsp; Nothing about the union ever had been said so 
      directly in print before in that medium.&nbsp; The G.M. liked it and it went to 
      press--making our legal counsel nervous.&nbsp; The employees soon after voted 
      not to strike.&nbsp; My piece did not bring that about.&nbsp; But it helped.&nbsp; It 
      made my boss look forthright without giving in on any substantive points.&nbsp; 
      He thanked me.&nbsp; I felt as if I had done something useful.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did you believe in what you did?&quot; asked 
      Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I would not have thought about it in 
      terms of belief,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;At that age and stage in working, don't 
      you want to feel your mental muscles strained to the maximum?&nbsp; You want to 
      show that you can move something.&nbsp; It doesn't much matter what.&nbsp; You want 
      to be in it, with it, doing it.&nbsp; That's the way it was in the company.&nbsp; 
      And I did enjoy that.&nbsp; But you get over being high on your own sheer 
      ability.&nbsp; So leaving that and coming here in some way involved me in 
      something I guess I could label 'beliefs.'</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Funny.&nbsp; My relationship with my father 
      was distant.&nbsp; I never got close to him.&nbsp; In all the jobs I have ever had, 
      I have built a special relationship with the men under whom I worked.&nbsp; I 
      felt that they approved of what I did.&nbsp; They encouraged me and applauded 
      when I did something right.&nbsp; And that meant more than I realized at the 
      time, I think.&nbsp; It made me follow them and perform for them whether or not 
      I 'believed' in what they were trying to do. Their loyalty to me was 
      functional, I am sure: it got more out of me.&nbsp; But that was fine.&nbsp; Without 
      getting psychoanalytic about it, I enjoyed my relationship with them as if 
      they were supplemental fathers.&nbsp; I needed their loyalty to focus my 
      attention, to get my energy into gear, to postpone, at least, the doubts I 
      had about the worth of what we were doing together.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You had doubts,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Beliefs.&nbsp; Doubts.&nbsp; For me they go 
      together.&nbsp; I've gone through the letters of Bomberger in the archives of 
      the college.&nbsp; If he expressed a doubt about his mission to create this 
      college or about his resolve to hurdle the thousand and one obstacles 
      against him, I did not find it.&nbsp; He did not falter in his belief.&nbsp; If he 
      had done so, we would not be sitting here in the ambience of his 
      memorial�under his fearsome gaze.&nbsp; I could never get inside the feeling of 
      such unflagging and simple belief as he must have had.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; I remember the hour after I left the 
      meeting at which the board told me I was the new president in 1976.&nbsp; I 
      went out to a special place of my boyhood in the ravines above the river, 
      just a couple of miles from this spot.&nbsp; 'What have I done!' I said to 
      myself.&nbsp; It was the most desperate moment I ever had in the whole time I 
      was president.&nbsp; Believe it or not, I was thinking of Bomberger, and of all 
      the men who had come after him.&nbsp; Compared to their steadfastness, my 
      resolve to have a vocation, to do something worthwhile, seemed like mere 
      juvenile ambition.&nbsp; How could I ever represent what they represented?&nbsp; I 
      will never forget the pain in my stomach at that moment.&nbsp; It felt as if 
      someone had stabbed me.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret asked, &quot;You didn't think you had 
      the same degree of belief they had in themselves?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Right--for that dreadful moment.&nbsp; I 
      doubted myself and the institutional imperative, the sense that it was 
      all-meaningful.&nbsp; But that moment in the ravines was merely a relapse.&nbsp; By 
      the fall of 1976, when I was inaugurated, I had pulled together a set of 
      convictions that operated.&nbsp; I think you could say I believed in 
      something.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the nick of time,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Right on schedule, actually,&quot; said 
      Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;Any lingering sense of doubt about my fitness for the job died 
      from that stab wound out there along the ravine.&nbsp; I never again felt I had 
      made the wrong decision to accept the presidency.&nbsp; That's not to say I did 
      not have many painful moments afterward.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So--what you had to do in the days of 
      Kent State was useful for you,&quot; Margaret said, arching her eyebrows in a 
      question.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes.&nbsp; My work with D. L. Helfferich from 
      1965 to his retirement as president in 1970 was filled with cross currents 
      and exhilaration.&nbsp; In the six years that followed, from 1970 until 1976, 
      while I was vice president to his successor, the dean, DLH as chancellor 
      continued to provide the main tension that led to my learning and 
      growing.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You call it tension.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One of the conditions required for 
      learning,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;DLH created it.&nbsp; In a sense he set the agenda 
      for my existence for eleven years.&nbsp; Growing up, my mother and father 
      drilled into me, without being specific, that I had to achieve something.&nbsp; 
      DLH picked me up and gave me the specific thing to shoot for.&nbsp; Within two 
      years of my coming to work at the college as alumni secretary and English 
      instructor, the agenda became overt between us.&nbsp; Even then the politics of 
      the college were intense.&nbsp; The small and parochial character of the place 
      only deepened its political intensity.&nbsp; So DLH could make no promises 
      about my future.&nbsp; Still, he wanted to shape me as much as he could so that 
      at least I would be a possibility for succession.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He wanted people to believe that he 
      could make anything happen.&nbsp; He was incurably romantic in his way--it 
      startled me once when I first made the generational connection between him 
      and the hyperbolic strutters in <i>This Side of Paradise</i>.&nbsp; DLH was 
      only four years younger than F. Scott Fitzgerald.&nbsp; World War I was a 
      defining experience for him too.&nbsp; He too was of the 'lost generation.'&nbsp; He 
      had a kind of Nietzschean freedom from bonds and limits.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He said he could put anyone in a job and 
      influence him sufficiently to do it well.&nbsp; That, by the way, led to some 
      pretty wrongheaded appointments in his time.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When he was president, he sought to make 
      the institution the shadow of himself.&nbsp; He bestrode the place.&nbsp; He was one 
      of&nbsp; four brothers who followed their grandfather and father to the 
      college.&nbsp; His wife and son were alumni.&nbsp; His grandchildren were enrolled 
      during my years under him.&nbsp; So to him the college was family.&nbsp; This 
      somehow turned the college in his mind into an absolute good.&nbsp; It also 
      made his sense of personal ownership close to total.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Helfferichs were historically folded 
      within the Pennsylvania German tradition.&nbsp; DLH said that his grandfather 
      was in the group associated with the German Reformed Church in the US that 
      started the college.&nbsp; Bomberger's religious beliefs therefore were always 
      central in the Helfferich vision of the college.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So, Helfferich was a 'believer' in the 
      same sense as Bomberger himself?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes-and-no,&quot; Bodger replied.&nbsp; &quot;I think 
      he and I got along so well because of that yes-and-no.&nbsp; DLH was closed and 
      open at the same time.&nbsp; He was firm in his adherence to his sense of the 
      origins and meaning of the institution.&nbsp; He affirmed the religious 
      heritage and sought to give the college the outward appearance of it until 
      his last day on earth.&nbsp; The Helfferich family tradition rested securely 
      within the womb of the denominational tribe--DLH's father and a brother 
      were preachers in it.&nbsp; He liked people to think of him as a quintessential 
      Reformed character.&nbsp; He was a pillar of the church.&nbsp; He took a major role 
      in the merging of the old denomination with the Congregational Christian 
      churches in the late '50s and its aftermath through the '60s.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;His behavior, however, belied his 
      apparent respectability as a churchman.&nbsp; The Helfferichs had a family 
      tradition <i>within </i>the Reformed tradition.&nbsp; It had the appearance of 
      brazenness--a sense of the absurd, you might say.&nbsp; Stuffiness was its 
      mortal adversary.&nbsp; Wit was its weapon.&nbsp; Legend said that DLH's father was 
      renowned within the circle of Reformed preachers of the early part of the 
      century for his phrase-making and his seeming iconoclasm.&nbsp; DLH carried 
      forward this paternal style.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The structure of that style was the key 
      to its effectiveness.&nbsp; His brazenness was securely anchored in his 
      propriety.&nbsp; He never abandoned his sense of occasion or his leading role 
      in the occasion.&nbsp; With that role clearly established, he could then be 
      brazen.&nbsp; He may never have ceased to be a 'preacher's kid.'&nbsp; A 'pk' lives 
      within the established system like no other kid.&nbsp; He can never get out of 
      it.&nbsp; But <i>within</i> it, hey, it's okay if he throws a dead cat into a 
      dark alley.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Preacher's kids of course get into a lot 
      of trouble for behaving that way.&nbsp; There is something irreconcilable about 
      the structure.&nbsp; DLH to his dying day was unexplainable in the minds of 
      many people at the college.&nbsp; The contradictions seemed too great.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The absurdist side of him at its best 
      came out as a sheer zest for living.&nbsp; He hated boredom.&nbsp; He despised 
      committees.&nbsp; He was a life-long actor, both on stage and off.&nbsp; For many 
      years he and his wife coached the dramatic club.&nbsp; His gestures partook of 
      the grand when he spoke.&nbsp; Even in more private moments, he positioned 
      himself consciously to achieve the greatest effect.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;His critics thought his theatricality 
      was too much.&nbsp; They missed the essential point: he usually had a purpose 
      in mind when he decided to say something or do something out of the 
      ordinary.&nbsp; He saw the outrageous as a tool.&nbsp; He used it to advance his 
      notion of&nbsp; sanity and respect for a vision of the universe.&nbsp; His vision, I 
      think, was that of the modern man individually upholding a belief in the 
      coherence and the mystery of an expanding and intentional universe.&nbsp; After 
      all the shenanigans, that' s where he came down.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I think that, in the end, he rested 
      quite securely in the accepted Protestant Christian view of the world.&nbsp; He 
      saw undergraduate higher education as a natural manifestation of Christian 
      belief and endeavor.&nbsp; As the controversies of the late '60s on campuses 
      raged, he managed the college with an appearance of confidence because he 
      had that view.&nbsp; He made people feel that the nuttiness would end, that his 
      view would prevail.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret nodded.&nbsp; &quot;Did it?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger replied, &quot;A style prevails even 
      when views do not.&nbsp; He knew better than many of his conservative 
      supporters that serious change was going on in the late '60s.&nbsp; One part of 
      him was quite clear: he wanted to stop it.&nbsp; The other part of him knew he 
      could not.&nbsp; He saw the conservative business person and conservative 
      church person as his principal constituents.&nbsp; He saw them as the parents 
      who would send their children to us and he viewed them as financial 
      supporters.&nbsp; Accordingly, he pitched his public rhetoric directly at them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Overhearing that rhetoric, the faculty 
      were sometimes aghast and fought with him when they could.&nbsp; His 
      inclination toward the unorthodox helped somewhat to keep them from 
      outright rebellion, and it helped him greatly in his relations with 
      students.&nbsp; He could get inside their youthful anarchism and sometimes 
      understand it better than faculty, certainly better than other senior 
      administrators.&nbsp; Once the kids were carrying picket signs in front of his 
      office, protesting about poor food or something.&nbsp; He came out of his 
      office and borrowed one of their signs and walked around with them.&nbsp; He 
      unapolgetically manipulated student affairs to keep the kids in tow.&nbsp; He 
      would offer a carrot and then shake a stick and wait until spring break 
      before coming down on a decision.&nbsp; By then, the students would lose 
      interest, as he knew they would.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He put me out in front with students as 
      his assistant and felt comfortable in doing so.&nbsp; He knew instinctively 
      that I had a maverick streak related to his.&nbsp; But he also knew that, as a 
      well-conditioned corporation man, I would not knowingly double cross him.&nbsp; 
      In parallel, he had a dean who was straight and strict without deviation.&nbsp; 
      The dean attracted the animosity of students and faculty, leaving the 
      president relatively untarnished.&nbsp; He and I to some degree became foils 
      for one another.&nbsp; I'm afraid I had the better bargain in terms of 
      popularity, anyway, since he took so much of the criticism for the 
      administration as a whole.&nbsp; It wasn't fair to the dean.&nbsp; But he was tough 
      and knew how to take it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If DLH truly believed every conservative 
      thing he said, he would not have managed the college through the troubled 
      years as successfully as he did.&nbsp; Deep within, he had his family bias for 
      the bizarre to draw upon.&nbsp; He also read the winds and knew he should bend 
      when they were too strong.&nbsp; That's why the '60s did not overwhelm him.&nbsp; He 
      drew upon the loyalty that his conservative supporters gave and had to ask 
      them to go on faith when he sounded as if he was going against their 
      beliefs.&nbsp; Largely, they went on faith.&nbsp; So he never fully had to resolve 
      the contradictions of the times.&nbsp; In the end, if he had to, he could admit 
      a mistake--to whichever party was aggrieved--and go forward.&nbsp; That's what 
      he did after he banned an atheist from speaking publicly on campus.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why was that such a controversy?&quot; 
      Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It grew out of the unusual climate of 
      the campus as it was in 1967,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; &quot;The college was committed to 
      open inquiry into truth in the academic sense--quite respectable as a 
      liberal arts institution.&nbsp; It was also committed to guiding students in 
      desired behavioral directions in the residential setting.&nbsp; That meant the 
      perpetuation of a set of social rules and regulations and the survival of 
      a sense that we were building Christian character, even after the faculty 
      defeated compulsory chapel attendance.&nbsp; If DLH sanctioned the appearance 
      of an atheist on campus, he would appear to be sanctioning a 'belief' 
      contrary to this extra-academic intention of the college.&nbsp; He had an 
      especially tough issue because the speaker was the nationally known 
      iconoclast, Madalyn Murray O'Hair.&nbsp; She won the Supreme Court case to ban 
      prayer in public schools.&nbsp; She was a big target and a vivid symbol.&nbsp; DLH 
      believed that the criticism of conservative parents and donors would be 
      unacceptably great if he did not step in and ban her appearance.&nbsp; He erred 
      in weighing that possible criticism against that of faculty and students.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But how could you reconcile banning her 
      with the freedom to seek the truth?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Precisely,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; &quot;There was the 
      conflict--although DLH said he objected to her vulgarity and obscenity 
      rather than her espousal of atheism.&nbsp; He ran the risk of reducing 
      religious principle to a question of manners. &quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft afternoon light entering 
      Bomberger chapel through the stained glass window had darkened.&nbsp; Margaret 
      glanced at her watch and jumped to her feet.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A student is coming to see me,&quot; she said 
      as she gathered up her bag.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I didn't do Kent State justice,&quot; Bodger 
      said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm getting the drift,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;Next 
      time.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone in the chapel, with no need to go 
      and meet anyone, Bodger stayed on for a few minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;He had often done 
      just this in those early years, after classes were done for the day and 
      students and faculty were elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">&quot;Belief,&quot; he said to 
      himself.&nbsp; There was a breadth of view in the college tradition that he 
      perceived without understanding it at first.&nbsp; The Reformed theology as it 
      developed in the US in the end seemed to him to be as compatible with free 
      inquiry as any religious tradition could be.&nbsp; Why, then, did DLH have 
      difficulty with such issues as O'Hair?&nbsp; Bodger came to think that 
      Helfferich confused a politico-social philosophy with religious doctrine.&nbsp; 
      DLH mistakenly tried to ground the politico-social objective of preserving 
      a set of norms in a religious position that did not essentially depend on 
      those norms.&nbsp; That is why they later could change under Bodger.&nbsp; But in 
      the meantime, during his years of apprenticeship under DLH, Bodger had 
      difficulty handling the tension.&nbsp; Still, it set the conditions for 
      learning in his apprenticeship.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked again at old Bomberger's 
      portrait.&nbsp; In the centennial history of the college, Bodger had read a 
      description of daily chapel during the first administration.&nbsp; Bomberger 
      would call an errant student to his feet in front of the entire student 
      body and faculty.&nbsp; He would point his finger at the miscreant, shake his 
      forked beard, and thunder his admonitions for all to hear.&nbsp; He could 
      imagine DLH in such a role, right here in the chapel named in memory of 
      that first worthy.&nbsp; DLH would have played the role with flair.&nbsp; But his 
      fulsome mustache, in place of the forked beard, would have twitched ever 
      so subtly at the height of his harangue.&nbsp; The student object of his 
      outrage would have caught that subtle signal.&nbsp; Together they would have 
      played out the scene, both projecting the appearance of an informed 
      sincerity while participating in a conspiracy of irony.&nbsp; When Bodger tried 
      to see himself as president in that same chapel scene still another 
      generation later, shorn of both beard and mustache, his imagination 
      failed.&nbsp; His fund of irony was not rich enough to enable him to pull it 
      off.&nbsp; The student would simply think he had lost his mind.&nbsp; The times were 
      utterly different.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rose from his chapel seat and headed 
      for dinner at home.&nbsp; He would look for notes of the O'Hair brouhaha and 
      piece the details back together again.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>In the O'Hair affair, Bodger tried to walk a 
      fine line</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his files,&nbsp; Bodger found a clipping 
      from a local paper.&nbsp; &quot;College Boots Out Atheist,&quot; the headline read.&nbsp; The 
      YM-YWCA student organization invited O'Hair to speak on campus.&nbsp; Neither 
      the president nor anyone else in the administration knew it had taken this 
      initiative.&nbsp; DLH took the position that the college had not authorized the 
      students to make such an agreement.&nbsp; Technically, he said, it was not the 
      college's agreement, and the college therefore was not obliged to welcome 
      O'Hair to campus.&nbsp; Her appearance would be incompatible with the Christian 
      background of the college.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The students rented a hall at a firehouse 
      in a neighboring town.&nbsp; O'Hair appeared there to a cheering crowd.&nbsp; The 
      rebuff by the college president made her feistier than usual.&nbsp; When she 
      said that freedom of speech and thought were lacking at the college, the 
      crowd of several hundred students and faculty roared their approval, 
      according to the article.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report was accurate, Bodger 
      reflected. His presence at the event symbolized the tension in the college 
      community and in him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He remembered his personal turmoil the afternoon 
      before O'Hair's speech.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">If he did not attend, he 
      would be demonstrating his solidarity with DLH, his boss--who a few days 
      before had confirmed that Bodger would formally become executive assistant 
      to the president.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he would be showing students, with 
      whom he was sympathetic, that he opposed their initiative; and he would be 
      putting uncomfortable distance between his faculty friends and himself.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he did attend, he would be running the 
      risk of inviting the ire of DLH, the dean, and other administrators who 
      would stand firm in support of the ban.&nbsp; But he would be showing students 
      and friends his tacit personal support for them and being faithful to his 
      own belief that the ban was a mistake.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he wobbled back and forth throughout 
      the afternoon, in a desperate maneuver he concocted the idea that his 
      attendance would help the administration.&nbsp; By attending, Bodger would be 
      perceived by students and faculty as a surrogate for the president.&nbsp; This 
      would undercut the impression of DLH's total hostility toward them.&nbsp; If 
      the president's assistant could be present, surely the administration's 
      declared posture was more a publicity maneuver than a substantive 
      opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; They would attribute to DLH a measure of irony and soften 
      their criticism of him.&nbsp; They would see that his opposition mainly served 
      his purpose of putting a good face on the college for the benefit of its 
      conservative supporters.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he attended.&nbsp; His administrative 
      colleagues failed to see the virtue in his action.&nbsp; They let him know 
      archly the next day of their sense of his apostasy.&nbsp; But apparently it did 
      not upset DLH himself.&nbsp; This became evident to Bodger as the president 
      processed the discontent that lingered among faculty and students after 
      O'Hair's appearance at the fire hall.&nbsp;&nbsp; The humanities faculty formally 
      criticized the banning and urged the president to approve a resolution 
      prohibiting the ban of speakers in the future on grounds of academic 
      freedom.&nbsp; To deflect the heat, DLH created a special committee on academic 
      freedom and appointed Bodger to it as a representative of the 
      administration.&nbsp; To Bodger, at least, this was DLH's implicit affirmation 
      of his decision to show up at the fire hall.&nbsp; To his other administrative 
      colleagues, it must have been a confusing signal from a boss to whom they 
      had been loyal.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president resolved the confusion at a 
      faculty meeting some time after O'Hair appeared.&nbsp; &quot;In retrospect,&quot; DLH 
      said from the chair, &quot;I made a mistake.&quot;&nbsp; By then, his decision had 
      rallied the admiration of conservative supporters, a main objective.&nbsp; He 
      did not go out of his way to apprise them of his subsequent admission on 
      campus to the faculty.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger felt that DLH's admission of a 
      mistake vindicated his decision to attend the O'Hair event.&nbsp; But he felt 
      troubled by his failure to influence DLH at the outset of the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      If he had done so, the president would not have had to try to unscramble 
      the egg that the ban cooked up.&nbsp; He was with DLH and other administrators 
      on the afternoon when the president began to formulate his resolve to keep 
      her off the campus.&nbsp; The others urged the president to ban her by 
      &quot;unilateral action&quot; to protect the college's &quot;institutional 
      self-respect.&quot;&nbsp; That meant not consulting the faculty ahead of time.&nbsp; 
      Bodger knew his faculty friends would react to being ignored.&nbsp; He thought 
      this was a price too high to pay for a position that he felt was wrong.&nbsp; 
      He said none of this at the meeting and watched quietly as DLH came to his 
      decision to act against O'Hair.&nbsp; About to be newly minted as the 
      president's assistant, he did not want to tarnish his position so early by 
      talking contentiously against a view that the others clearly held and that 
      DLH himself wanted to adopt.&nbsp; He left the meeting with a dead weight over 
      his eyes.&nbsp; He apparently saw more clearly than any of them that DLH's 
      decision was about to rend the fabric of the campus community in a 
      willfully unnecessary way.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He found the following entry in his 
      journal about this moment:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;If I had not allowed my own 
      political considerations to keep me quiet, I might have raised a rational 
      dissent and perhaps given DL a chance to think of a different course of 
      action.&nbsp; My job is to give the man counsel, and I sure muffed the chance.&nbsp; 
      From now on, if I have any conviction on an issue, I will let him know 
      what it is, even if I know it is counter to his own inclinations or to 
      others counseling him.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>When he recounted all this to 
      Margaret at their next meeting, Bodger said that his involvement in the 
      O'Hair episode was a useful example of his entire eleven-year 
      apprenticeship under Helfferich.&nbsp; &quot;I did not rest comfortably with what 
      seemed like the narrower aspects of the tradition of the college,&quot; he 
      said.&nbsp; &quot;I was naturally pulled toward those people and events that seemed 
      to push toward openness, breadth, greater freedom.&nbsp; It was remarkable to 
      me that DLH took me into his inner circle so willingly and supported me 
      and taught me what he knew.&nbsp; No matter how I circled around or wobbled in 
      the face of an issue on his desk, he always gave me a feeling of trust.&nbsp; 
      That was a powerful motivator.&nbsp; It made me loyal to him.&nbsp; It made me do 
      administrative duties I never thought I would want to do or be capable of 
      doing.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But you kept doing them,&quot; Margaret 
      chided.&nbsp; &quot;Something in the administrative work must have satisfied you at 
      some level.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she spoke, another snippet from his 
      journal of that time scrolled in his mind's eye:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reaffirm my belief that Gully 
      Jimson [Joyce Cary's protagonist in</i> The Horse's Mouth<i>] is greater 
      than all: art will outlast all.&nbsp; In the end, administration is the 
      manipulative art which, though it do good unto others, drains the 
      administrator of his life-juices and pours them off into oblivion.&nbsp; The 
      fulfilling art is that which deals with the materials of semblance, as 
      dear Suzanne [Langer, </i>Philosophy in a New Key<i>] would say, not of 
      reality.&nbsp; Administration is an art all right, but it sucks out one's 
      creative power and there is no deposit in form.&nbsp; It is evanescent and 
      deathly.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You are right,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; 
      &quot;It was what I called my 'excremental vision' that kept me going, against 
      another vision, of art as everything.&quot; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>The campus felt the effect of the Kent State 
      killings </u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Kent State,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I can talk about the years of the late 
      '60s leading up to it.&nbsp; You have to remember that the college was a 
      tightly managed little place in the heart of a conservative WASP 
      community.&nbsp; Many alumni--by no means all--had a rock-like sense of 
      reality, which translated into political caution.&nbsp; They liked the idea 
      that, while the ivy campuses and 'liberal' places like Swarthmore were 
      erupting in student violence, our college was noticeable by its absence 
      from the headlines.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You kept the lid on,&quot; Margaret echoed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We were less prone to disorder for a 
      couple of reasons,&quot; Bodger went on.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For one, Helfferich was a tough, 
      combative bird.&nbsp; He briefly had been a professional prizefighter and a 
      merchant marine as a young guy.&nbsp; He always relished a good bout.&nbsp; In a 
      special issue of the college magazine on his life, you see him pictured 
      bare-chested aboard ship in 1920, when he was a sea-faring man.&nbsp; It's easy 
      to imagine that well-formed physique in the ring.&nbsp; The belligerence shown 
      by students got his blood boiling.&nbsp; The fatal heart attack of the 
      Swarthmore president in the heat of a student protest affected the 
      feelings of all college administrators around here.&nbsp; The national coverage 
      of gun-toting kids in front of the library at Cornell, the rise of rock in 
      a cloud of marijuana--the whole cultural swing of youth was to him like a 
      red flag to a bull.&nbsp; He was damned determined that they would not get the 
      upper hand here.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;His stance went under the disguise of 
      cultural responsibility.&nbsp; His admirers among the board and alumni 
      applauded his declarations that the college stood foursquare against the 
      insanity of the times.&nbsp; He saw a herd instinct at work among the feisty 
      youth of the late '60s, not the flowering of free-thinking individualism, 
      as the ideology proclaimed.&nbsp; He thought the kids were conformist sheep in 
      their putative nonconformity.&nbsp; He claimed the high ground of liberal 
      education against the young people calling for the revamping of the very 
      grounds of learning.&nbsp; He said the college would continue to teach students 
      to think and to prevent them from all thinking alike.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That doesn't sound very hide-bound,&quot; 
      Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It wasn't.&nbsp; DLH felt the need to make 
      almost a fetish of 'conservatism' for the sake of his presumed external 
      audience.&nbsp; But the cultural wars of the '60s did not split conservatives 
      from liberals.&nbsp; They lumped conservatives and liberals together on one 
      side, although they repudiated one another.&nbsp; It took me some years 
      afterward to realize that my liberal leanings did not differentiate me 
      from DLH and the board as much as I feared.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On the other side were the extreme 
      leaders of the youth revolution.&nbsp; To them, it did not matter if you were 
      conservative or liberal.&nbsp; You were wrong either way.&nbsp; In the extreme 
      formulation of the '60s revolution, the whole system of government and 
      industry and the military and education had to go.&nbsp; Liberals had a harder 
      time than conservatives in dealing with this because they wanted to allow 
      room for the students' viewpoint.&nbsp; At least conservatives could stand 
      foursquare against the forces of New Left youth and pit force against 
      force to support their stand.&nbsp; That suited Helfferich's disposition.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The SDS--Students for a Democratic 
      Society--epitomized the radicalism of the campuses in those years.&nbsp; If you 
      looked at their pronouncements, you saw that politically they opposed the 
      broad liberal consensus even more than a specific conservative posture.&nbsp; 
      Marcuse's concept of the 'one-dimensional society' helped SDS and their 
      ilk to define the enemy, which turned out to be ubiquitous.&nbsp; The 
      capitalist hegemony that sustained the Cold War as well as the hot Vietnam 
      War became the target.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I found interesting was the translation of a 
      political agenda into a personal agenda.&nbsp; To achieve a political upheaval, 
      a young person was called on to achieve a personal upheaval--to turn on, 
      drop out, wear different clothes, allow hair to grow, join a commune, and 
      so on.&nbsp; All this was to be in the service of a romantic vision of a 
      permissive, unhierarchical vision of a world that could never be.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>The Greening of America</i>,&quot; 
      Margaret said.&nbsp; &quot;I read it in college, after it was forgotten.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Right.&nbsp; Charles Reich thought that 
      eating unprocessed peanut butter and wearing bell-bottom trousers would 
      bring in the revolution.&nbsp; In the case of SDS, the theme of the revolution 
      was power to the people.&nbsp; The power was supposed to manifest itself in 
      radically democratic forms.&nbsp; Students were being urged by SDS to hold 
      teach-ins on campuses against the war and against the 'system's' 
      victimization of minorities and the poor. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One day word spread around campus that a 
      rider for the SDS would arrive on a motorcycle at noon.&nbsp; He reportedly 
      would be organizing a chapter then and there in order to radicalize our 
      too-quiet campus.&nbsp; The handful of activist kids on campus put out the word 
      that everyone should get together in front of the administration building 
      at noon that day to greet the emissary from the great cultural war blazing 
      on American campuses.&nbsp; We alerted the local part-time policeman, just in 
      case--we had only one.&nbsp; Our dean of men doubled as football coach.&nbsp; He and 
      a few of his hefty linemen were out of sight but at the ready.&nbsp; At noon, 
      about fifty students responded to the call and milled around together.&nbsp; 
      Soon they heard the gunning of a motorcycle engine as the SDS 
      representative rode up the campus drive.&nbsp; When he pulled to a stop, the 
      president strode out of the administration building and walked right up to 
      the visitor, his white mane waving.&nbsp; They exchanged a few words, which I 
      could not hear clearly from where I was standing.&nbsp; They had something to 
      do with the privacy of the campus and our wish to keep it that way.&nbsp; The 
      visitor had a few&nbsp; words with a couple of the students while DLH stood his 
      ground.&nbsp; And then he turned his motorcycle around and left!&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What would the president have done if he 
      hadn't?&quot; asked Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We didn't discuss it beforehand, so I 
      could not know for certain.&nbsp; On another campus, the massed students would 
      have raised hell with him then and there.&nbsp; Most of ours treated the 
      incident with mild curiosity and went off to one o'clock classes.&nbsp; The few 
      organizers were so outnumbered that they had no immediate recourse.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We had a spectrum of political 
      commitment among our students, of course, but the majority of them were 
      watching out for number one, not throwing themselves onto the ramparts for 
      the revolution.&nbsp; The draft put a damper on the men.&nbsp; They did not want to 
      get kicked out of college, so they played things cautiously.&nbsp; The women 
      were quietly going through the revaluation of values that was fast 
      becoming the women's liberation movement.&nbsp; But our place was not the place 
      where the wave was breaking.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;While the campuses in the limelight 
      thrashed it out over national issues surrounding Vietnam and civil rights, 
      our students thrashed it out with the administration over the campus rules 
      against alcohol and visitation in the women's dormitories.&nbsp; Often the 
      conflicts seemed trivial.&nbsp; But the board and administration were solidly 
      against changing those rules.&nbsp; Students were increasingly unhappy with 
      them.&nbsp; Later even some parents and alumni would favor some modification.&nbsp; 
      But the late '60s were not the time for DLH to bend.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the 
      administration took hard knocks, and life was quite stressful for us all.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Still, the kids worked out a <i>modus 
      vivendi</i> of sorts.&nbsp; They widely ignored the rules but managed to keep a 
      semblance of obedience in place.&nbsp; The student life deans, for their part, 
      along with student proctors, figured out an unacknowledged double standard 
      that allowed youthful life to go on.&nbsp; To keep up appearances, now and then 
      the deans would come down hard on this dorm or that and students would be 
      kicked out--a few of them no doubt destined to deal with the vagaries of 
      the draft as a consequence.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The stand-off on social rules drove some 
      students away from the campus. Although the fight over rules usually 
      centered on the ban on beer, marijuana became increasingly evident.&nbsp; Kids 
      even suspected of using it would be dismissed by quiet administrative 
      action, but that did not stop the trend.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;To escape the regimen, a small group, I 
      learned, rented the old town train station.&nbsp; By then passenger trains had 
      stopped running.&nbsp; The railway company had not yet disposed of the property 
      and had rented it as a domicile.&nbsp; I had a special relationship with a 
      couple of the guys in the group.&nbsp; One night they invited me down.&nbsp; With 
      much hesitation, I went.&nbsp; They ushered me into the old waiting room and 
      then up a ladder to the windowless loft.&nbsp; It was the pad of 
      pads--mattresses on the floor, blankets and pillows here and there, plus 
      an unmistakable redolence of sweet smoke.&nbsp; Fortunately, they did not do 
      marijuana in my presence.&nbsp; They offered a beer but I refused it.&nbsp; We had a 
      fine old bull session together.&nbsp; We settled the fate of the dawning world 
      and worked out the answers to the campus dilemmas as well.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That visit has stayed in my mind all 
      these years because of the naivet� both of us displayed and the newness in 
      the air that it captured.&nbsp; All students were required to live only in 
      college housing or at home if they were locals.&nbsp; By inviting an 
      administrative officer of the college to their cozy pad, they put 
      themselves in danger of being disciplined if not dismissed for violating 
      that rule.&nbsp; Offering me beer and allowing me to infer they&nbsp; used the place 
      to smoke pot only compounded their vulnerability.&nbsp; By accepting their 
      invitation, I put my administrative position at risk.&nbsp; My fellow 
      administrators already thought of me as a weak-willed sympathizer with 
      students and liberal faculty.&nbsp; If they learned of my clandestine visit, my 
      dependability would be doubly questioned.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;However, although I never told him about 
      it, I was sure that DLH would have disapproved only if I had been 
      compromised publicly.&nbsp; He knew that I was connecting with the students in 
      a way that he could not.&nbsp; He wanted to know what they were thinking from 
      the inside.&nbsp; I seemed to be the only administrator who could give that to 
      him unfiltered by the bureaucratic screen through which the other 
      administrators viewed things.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was one of the benefits that came with 
      my never before having been an educator.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Where was the train station?&quot; Margaret 
      asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The railroad sold it to a fast food 
      place after the town failed to raise the money to make it an historic 
      landmark.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next time you have a pizza at the Hut, shed a tear for the 
      '60s.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So,&quot; Margaret summed up, &quot;a tough 
      president with imagination and a cautious student body equaled relative 
      tranquillity?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Every baby boomer felt the waves of 
      change,&quot; Bodger said, &quot;even those who thought the hippies and yippies and 
      war protesters were wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was surely the case that the 
      particular circumstances here kept things from falling completely apart.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You had no really <i>good </i>anti-war 
      riots, then?&quot; Margaret asked. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'll try to catch the flavor.&nbsp; In the 
      spring of '69, just a year before Kent State, an unofficial group of 
      students formed a 'Concern' organization.&nbsp; They sent out a flyer calling 
      for a rally in the football stands.&nbsp; The issue was not the war.&nbsp; It was 
      the social rules that the college insisted upon.&nbsp; An official 
      student-faculty-administration committee had put forth some proposals for 
      open dorms and drinking on campus.&nbsp; The convoluted process for reviewing 
      them prevented quick review and passage.&nbsp; As the weather warmed, 
      impatience rose.&nbsp; The 'Concern' group sent out a flyer--I found an old 
      copy of it.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger handed Margaret the paper to read:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The official committees are hamstrung 
      by paper shuffling.&nbsp; The &quot;Concern&quot; is a body of students who wish to, in a 
      peaceful, orderly, and rational way, call to the administration's 
      attention the students' wishes, especially in regard to the imminent 
      decision on the recommendations for open dorm and drinking privileges.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Concern&quot; has two main goals.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) To promote a sense of cohesiveness 
      and unity in a student body now in a state of anomie, alienation, and 
      disintereest.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)To provide a channel for the 
      students to make the college a more livable, modern institution in keeping 
      with other schools of its caliber.&nbsp; &quot;Concern&quot; is of, by, and for the 
      students.&nbsp; It is not behind or in front of them--it is with them.&nbsp; It has 
      and wants no power without a firm base of student support.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first priority is a show of 
      support for the proposals for open dorms and drinking.&nbsp; To best accomplish 
      this, on Tuesday, May 13, the &quot;Concern&quot; will meet on the football field 
      with anyone interested in taking part in a peaceful, orderly and quiet 
      show of student feelings.&nbsp; From there, we will move to the president's 
      office, congregate for a short time, and finally disperse.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Let me guess,&quot; Margaret said.&nbsp; 
      &quot;The president was displeased--and not just because of the majestically 
      split infinitive in the second sentence.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The students toting guns on the steps of 
      the Cornell library had recently been on front pages across the nation.&nbsp; 
      The week before the planned rally, a board committee had told us they 
      expected us to be as rough as possible on any students who disrupted the 
      college.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; We made elaborate preparations.&nbsp; DLH 
      was a special patron of the football team.&nbsp; He had been a player at the 
      college in his student days and connected, man to man, with the guys.&nbsp; He 
      called in the captains and asked them to take some of the squad members to 
      the rally, but to stand at a distance as visible non-participants.&nbsp; The 
      leaders of 'Concern' were not part of the jock culture of campus.&nbsp; --You 
      may see why I thought DLH would understand my complicity with the students 
      at the railroad station lair.&nbsp; The dean of men was detailed to go and note 
      the names of speakers and other organizers.&nbsp; Again, the local authority 
      was put on alert.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We met in advance with the student 
      leaders of 'Concern' and laid down some specific ground rules.&nbsp; There was 
      to be orderly discussion, and there was to be no march on the president's 
      office afterward.&nbsp; As an alternative to the march, Helfferich agreed to 
      meet afterward with a delegation from the rally of any twelve students.&nbsp; 
      In this advance meeting with them, he adopted his brusque persona.&nbsp; He 
      made it clear that they had walked onto thinner ice than they might have 
      gauged.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On the day of the rally, about two 
      hundred students showed up at the football field.&nbsp; Many were there out of 
      curiosity, not as loyal followers of the 'Concern' people.&nbsp; They drifted 
      away before the end of the speeches.&nbsp; The speeches were mild in tone, 
      cautious in substance.&nbsp; No delegation went to see the president.&nbsp; 
      'Concern' died, I think, when the semester ended shortly thereafter.&nbsp; The 
      leader, however, got an invitation from DLH to attend the college board 
      meeting afterward and handled himself well.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The art of co-option,&quot; Margaret 
      observed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Absolutely,&quot; Boger replied.&nbsp; &quot;It was a 
      main ingredient in the glue to hold the place together.&nbsp; By fair means and 
      other means.&nbsp; We followed up with plans for seminars in the fall on 
      values, discussions among students, faculty, and administrators.&nbsp; One 
      thing DLH was never unwilling to do was talk.&nbsp; There was a kind of 
      effrontery in the basic attack made on the 'system' by the ideologues.&nbsp; 
      They saw the system manipulating the young into positions of subservience 
      and, in the case of service in Vietnam, terror.&nbsp; To a degree our small 
      campus efforts, mostly successful, to keep control fitted the critique.&nbsp; 
      Ours was a benign terror, to be sure.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That summer saw the rise of the national 
      Vietnam Moratorium Committee.&nbsp; By August, I was in discussion with the 
      student leadership about plans for a moratorium in October on campus, to 
      coincide with the national moratorium.&nbsp; The emphasis was on fair and open 
      discussion of all sides of the issue.&nbsp; Helfferich constantly impressed on 
      me the political value of the highest commitment to open discussion.&nbsp; He 
      was right, I thought, to expect student rallies of any kind to be 
      intolerant of the other viewpoint.&nbsp; The students could never credibly 
      argue against his call for representation of both sides of an issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our 
      faculty strongly supported that rational stance as well.&nbsp; Actually, if DLH 
      had listened to himself more carefully, he would have pitted Madalyn 
      Murray O'Hair against a credible opponent and allowed her to enter.&nbsp; He 
      could have claimed victory of a different sort over O'Hair and her student 
      hosts.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did the moratorium lead to any greater 
      trouble than the event on the football field?&quot; asked Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not in numbers.&nbsp; The college had certain 
      numbers written in the stars.&nbsp; We would have 300 freshmen, give or take, 
      forever.&nbsp; We would have 200 activist students forever.&nbsp; That would leave 
      900 students who would watch the 200 activists while quietly forming their 
      own private opinions, and meanwhile doing their work.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Again, Helfferich did not let events 
      drift toward confrontation.&nbsp; Before the students came back in September 
      1969, he sent a letter home to parents and students.&nbsp;&nbsp; I worked well as a 
      ghostwriter with him.&nbsp; In that, my relationship with him extended a 
      lengthening history as a loyal spearman to leaders in need of words on 
      paper--my major in the Army, Charlie Simpson, head of my company, now DLH.&nbsp; 
      Helfferich had a totalistic kind of mind.&nbsp; He would size up the entire 
      situation and develop a position within it, even before he had words that 
      explained where that position was.&nbsp; He would have a phrase, often vivid, 
      to tag it, but it would take a word smithy to make a presentable public 
      package.&nbsp; I increasingly provided that service.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The letter congratulated ourselves for 
      escaping the unhappy headlines of recent months about disorder on college 
      campuses.&nbsp; It commended the common sense of the majority of our 
      students--an act of faith by DLH, to be sure.&nbsp; It applauded the 
      willingness of administration and faculty to listen.&nbsp; It underlined our 
      determination to deal firmly with students who crossed well-defined limits 
      of behavior.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The letter acknowledged, however, that 
      the college was not without a share of student discontent.&nbsp; It indicated 
      that we were sending the letter to make sure that students and parents 
      understood that we expected students to obey the rules of the college.&nbsp; It 
      promised that the college would continue to consider student suggestions 
      for change.&nbsp; But it declared that our willingness to listen did not mean a 
      willingness to agree to every proposal.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It forthrightly told drug users that 
      they would be subject to dismissal.&nbsp; It acknowledged that the rules on 
      drinking alcohol and visiting dorms were less liberal than many students 
      wanted and remained unapologetic about that.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Finally, it said love us or leave us, in 
      effect.&nbsp; If you can't hack it here, we'll help you find a place 
      elsewhere.&nbsp; Go in peace.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My liking for Alfred North Whitehead's 
      style made marks on more than one piece coming out of DLH's office.&nbsp; This 
      letter ended with Whitehead's justification for a university from his 
      Harvard Business School speech of 1924.&nbsp; 'The justification for a 
      university is that it preserves the connection between knowledge and the 
      zest for life, by uniting the young and the old in the imaginative 
      consideration of learning.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You had a happy fall semester?&quot; asked 
      Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Essentially, yes.&nbsp; 'Happiness' was not a 
      word for that time, though.&nbsp; It was as if the energy emitted by the 
      fireball of a whole generation was scorching most established functions 
      and values--from peanut butter to the definition of reality itself.&nbsp; The 
      waves of enthusiasm and anger had a tantalizing quality for most of the 
      students, regardless of particular issues--that's why some of our students 
      could be as exercised over funny little social rules as others elsewhere 
      became over international policy.&nbsp; I have to say that much of the faculty 
      and staff similarly felt charged up at that time--and everybody, including 
      the president, had to modify rhetoric because of the student audience.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I had only recently abandoned the 
      corporate scene because of the limitations I felt that it set on my 
      development.&nbsp; The college offered up a stark contrast.&nbsp; To be riding the 
      back of what seemed like a unique wave of college and national history was 
      exhilarating, even though it caused great anguish and uncertainty day by 
      day.&nbsp; Looking over my notes of the times, I would have to conclude that, 
      yes, I was happy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Vietnam Moratorium in the fall 
      actually went well here.&nbsp; It was messy at some campuses around the 
      country, I'm sure.&nbsp; The students and administration and faculty here 
      worked together on it.&nbsp; Our students did not make the mistake that others 
      made.&nbsp; They did not equate their educational institution with the larger 
      establishment target of their discontent.&nbsp; Helfferich had the good sense 
      to work along with the students.&nbsp; I dare say my influence and direct 
      involvement with the students helped him to find a comfortable way through 
      this.&nbsp; We had speakers, discussions, a candlelight walk.&nbsp; A draft 
      counselor came to tell students how to do alternative service.&nbsp; A German 
      professor, with Quaker convictions against war, keynoted the day.&nbsp; Other 
      professors took polite issue with him.&nbsp; At lunch students 'fasted' by 
      eating plain rice instead of the standard dining hall fare.&nbsp; Two other 
      humanities instructors and I led a discussion on 'art and violence.'&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
      don't remember what we said.&nbsp; I would be amazed if I did not hold forth on 
      the transformative power of art.&nbsp; DLH gave a talk at a tree planting for 
      peace in which he declared war as a political procedure to be archaic and 
      parochial.&nbsp; It was what the protesting students wanted to hear, but he 
      carefully couched his words to be sure they could be read approvingly by 
      conservative board members.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So much of what we were doing involved 
      political language and symbolism.&nbsp; It was the game of the war protesters, 
      of the youth movement generally.&nbsp; We had to play the game their way, to 
      some extent, at least, with language and symbolism to match.&nbsp; The two 
      hundred or so who were involved had energy, but most of their political 
      ideas were borrowed.&nbsp; Our Moratorium itself was in response to a national 
      call, not to an indigenous urge.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;By the time Kent State happened in the 
      spring of 1970, we had this train of experience behind us.&nbsp; There was an 
      expression of anger on campus, yes.&nbsp; We had to process it, yes.&nbsp; We had an 
      audience off-campus in need of reassurance that we were not allowing a 
      bunch of kids to wreck the place.&nbsp; I can't emphasize enough how important 
      that seemed to be at the time.&nbsp; There was outrage at a whole generation on 
      both sides.&nbsp; The young people were mad at the leaders; the leaders were 
      mad as hell that youth had somehow escaped from control and were dictating 
      the course of events.&nbsp; That was outrageous in their eyes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We never lost sight of that other 
      audience off campus, embodied in some board members and leading alumni.&nbsp; 
      We knew that words acceptable and useful in keeping the lid on in the 
      campus situation could raise the hackles of off-campus onlookers.&nbsp; 
      Helfferich was just about seventy years of age in that last year of his 
      administration, when the moratorium and Kent State took place.&nbsp; He taught 
      me how youthful and resilient one can be in managing affairs, regardless 
      of chronological age.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Kent State came a couple of days after 
      Nixon decided to make his extraordinary bombing raid on Cambodia.&nbsp; I 
      personally think of it as the last act of the World War II generation.&nbsp; 
      You had to have lived through World War II to understand how Nixon could 
      decide that such an attack made sense.&nbsp; As a kid in the '40s, I sat 
      through many newsreel films and movies that celebrated the raining of 
      bombs on cities.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an icon of our times, a symbol of good--just as 
      pictures of black smoke belching out of stacks came to symbolize 
      industrial progress after the war.&nbsp; I have not read Nixon's books and have 
      never been that interested in understanding what he thought the bombing 
      would bring about.&nbsp; We know what it brought about on the domestic front.&nbsp; 
      It raised the pitch of war protest to a new height.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When the four students were killed at 
      Kent State on 4 May 1970, the spring semester had only a couple of weeks 
      remaining.&nbsp; Professors were scheduling a lot of tests.&nbsp; Students, faculty, 
      and administrators all shared the frayed feeling built up by a long, hard 
      academic year.&nbsp; The college community also was coping with the 
      uncertainties of a search for a president to succeed Helfferich.&nbsp; He had 
      announced a year before that he would leave after the 1969-70 academic 
      year.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;His impending departure from office 
      undoubtedly made it easier for him to manage the tension of Kent State.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      His off-campus audiences mattered less to him.&nbsp; He felt less compelled to 
      look like a hard hat.&nbsp; The annealing fact in the whole thing, of course, 
      was the violent death of four students.&nbsp; Who on a college campus could not 
      mourn the death of students by any means?&nbsp; Who could not feel outraged at 
      death itself?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Students at Kent State had plundered the 
      town's business district in the course of the protest demonstrations.&nbsp; In 
      hindsight, it would be possible to understand the Guardsmen's feeling that 
      the students were out to destroy their own civic fabric and needed to be 
      stopped.&nbsp; The pictures of felled young people, their friends weeping over 
      them, however, prevented any balanced view.&nbsp; I have found that college 
      students always are very sensitive to the death of the young anywhere, 
      under any circumstances.&nbsp; Here and on campuses everywhere, students 
      treated the death of the Kent State students like the death of students on 
      their own campus.&nbsp; But the mourning went forward in the hot brew of 
      political outrage.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So you <i>did</i> have violence,&quot; 
      Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Violence of mind, sure.&nbsp; We did not have 
      any senseless physical violence.&nbsp; The closest I came to it took place in 
      my classroom.&nbsp; I was teaching an English comp course in Bomberger after 
      lunch.&nbsp; The flagpole, just outside our windows, became the focal point for 
      mourning the death of the Kent State students.&nbsp; Our students were pursuing 
      a fairly well-organized agenda of commemoration.&nbsp; In the dining hall, a 
      student had played taps.&nbsp; Then 'the 200' massed around the flagpole.&nbsp; Four 
      white styrofoam tombstones were inscribed with the names of the Kent State 
      dead and placed around the flagpole.&nbsp; Then the flag was lowered to 
      half-mast and faculty and students gave speeches.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I had a Vietnam veteran in my class.&nbsp; He 
      walked with an artificial leg but was physically robust.&nbsp; He was still 
      trying to come home.&nbsp; He wrote long, tortured papers about death and dying 
      in war. He would write two thousand words for a five-hundred-word 
      assignment.&nbsp; I seem to remember he was a medical corpsman--so his basic 
      assignment in battle was to reach the wounded.&nbsp; It was clear to me that 
      the writing was therapeutic for him.&nbsp; I did what I could to encourage him 
      while meeting the requirements of the course.&nbsp; Emotionally, he was on the 
      edge and ready to go over at any time.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The class was watching the proceedings 
      outside the classroom.&nbsp; I gave up trying to conduct the usual lessons.&nbsp; 
      When the students outside lowered the flag to half-mast, our vet lost it.&nbsp; 
      He came up out of his seat with a roar and plunged out of the room.&nbsp; He 
      would have weighed in against the students who lowered the flag if some of 
      us had not succeeded in restraining him at the door of Bomberger.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He believed in the war,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;At that point, of course,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; 
      &quot;Think of his investment in it.&nbsp; God knows what he came to believe in 
      time.&nbsp; I do not remember his name; I think he left the college without 
      taking a degree.&nbsp; I always have thought of that young guy as a victim no 
      less than the students who were shot at Kent State.&nbsp; The cruelty that 
      became common currency in the '60s did not cease to circulate in our 
      society after we got out of Vietnam.&nbsp; It just took on different shapes and 
      colors.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And that was Kent State here, sum and 
      substance?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I went back and looked at the student 
      paper that reported the week.&nbsp; It reminded me that about a hundred 
      students marched down Main Street to the Perkiomen bridge and back on the 
      day of the shootings.&nbsp; It was 'a solemn and orderly show of peace 
      desires.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear in mind, if a hundred marched, a thousand did not.&nbsp; The 
      guys in a Main Street dorm water-ballooned the marchers as they went by.&nbsp; 
      The police stopped the water bombing.&nbsp; I had not remembered that.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The student leaders tried to get all 
      tests and quizzes canceled on 7 May, when the flag pole proceedings would 
      take place.&nbsp; This became a point of continued conflict.&nbsp; Many faculty 
      informally cooperated, I think, but officially the college did not grant 
      the request.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;With the experience of the moratorium 
      the previous semester, students were pretty well schooled in setting up 
      discussions and talks.&nbsp; We worked as closely with them as we could to keep 
      the whole proceeding in a mode of rational discourse or prayerful 
      reflection.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The flag pole remained the rallying 
      point.&nbsp; After our vet ended my class, my students and I joined the group.&nbsp; 
      Faculty spoke.&nbsp; One of our philosophers gave his 'curse of all philosophy' 
      speech, a plea for reason and compassion.&nbsp; While he spoke, the flag 
      unaccountably was raised again to the top of the pole.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was much 
      debate and discussion before the flag again came down to half-mast.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was surprised to learn from the paper 
      that at that very point I spoke to the group, one of several faculty 
      invited.&nbsp; I had completely forgotten that.&nbsp; The complete quote from my 
      talk in the paper was to the effect that the campus is where mind and 
      emotion meet.&nbsp; We always were trying to put the brakes on the emotional 
      excess of the students.&nbsp; We were always trying to hold them to a 
      commitment to rational discourse.&nbsp; At least I think that's what I was 
      getting at.&nbsp; Control, largely, was our game, whether we liked it or not.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;By then I was a vice president.&nbsp; My 
      presence at the flagpole to some extent was as a representative for the 
      president.&nbsp; He did not speak there.&nbsp; But the students knew he would take a 
      benign view of things as long as they did not get out of control.&nbsp; After 
      the rally around the flagpole ended, the flag again went back to the top, 
      put there by pro-war students and some townies who were members of the 
      American Legion.&nbsp; They had watched the march down Main Street, apparently, 
      with disapproval.&nbsp; The styrofoam tombstones somehow lit up their pro-war 
      sentiment.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When DLH learned the flag had gone up 
      again, he came out of the administration building and personally returned 
      it to half-mast.&nbsp; It was one of those moments when his instincts merged 
      with the mood of the students.&nbsp; There was something quite beautiful about 
      the way this seventy-year-old man caught the youthful feelings in that 
      gesture.&nbsp; Of course, I am quite sure he was thinking of the need to 
      control their behavior.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The student reporter quoted Helfferich's 
      assessment of the Kent State remembrance.&nbsp; 'The only difference between 
      you and me,' she reported he said, 'is that I walk on the sidewalk and you 
      walk on the grass.'</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Kent State days wound up on the 
      following Saturday, May 9.&nbsp; It was time for the traditional Spring 
      Festival dance, once called May Day.&nbsp; The college perpetuated this tribal 
      tradition from more innocent days.&nbsp; Ours was probably one of the last to 
      do so.&nbsp; Before the dance, about thirty students carried an American flag 
      and peace signs on the football field in front of the assembled students 
      and parents.&nbsp; You get the pulse of our students when you read what 
      happened then.&nbsp; The thirty went into the stands and watched the rest of 
      the May Day show.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Delightful,&quot; Margaret agreed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There was one lingering desire among the 
      seniors.&nbsp; They wanted to show their feelings about Kent State and Cambodia 
      at commencement, scheduled for early June.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was talk of walkouts, 
      impromptu speeches, and other now-familiar commencement antics.&nbsp; This 
      called for real negotiation.&nbsp; One of the honorary degree recipients was a 
      target for a proposal of a major gift.&nbsp; She had a conservative political 
      tilt, and she did not like youthful disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her money-laden family 
      and corporate minions would be in the audience, compounding the danger of 
      losing financial support.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was apparently the first administrator 
      to learn about the movement among seniors.&nbsp; By chance I encountered the 
      leader in the administration lobby two weeks or so before commencement.&nbsp; 
      He asked if I had heard about the protest plans.&nbsp; I quickly learned that 
      no one had told the president about them.&nbsp; I sought out the class 
      president, who was to be the front man.&nbsp; I told him he had better see the 
      president right away, since their plans had possible consequences that 
      they could not imagine.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The path of Helfferich's changing 
      position between his first meeting with the leaders and the day of 
      graduation revealed much to me.&nbsp; At first, he asked the students to do 
      absolutely nothing, in deference to our guests.&nbsp; They showed an 
      understanding of the problem but still wanted to have a show of concern 
      about Kent State and Cambodia.&nbsp; They were willing to talk about a moderate 
      approach without promising that they could control the students already 
      incited to act.&nbsp; At that point, DLH was hard-nosed.&nbsp; He told me that he 
      would not permit those who wanted to demonstrate to appear for their 
      degrees.&nbsp; One of the student life administrators gave hardball counsel.&nbsp; 
      He encouraged DLH to write to parents a week before commencement and tell 
      them that their sons and daughters would get diplomas in the mail--student 
      commencement would be cancelled.&nbsp; The president had often thought of such 
      a move and was so inclined.&nbsp; I thought it was fortunate that he continued 
      talking with student leaders after he got that advice.&nbsp; I was sitting in 
      on most of the conversations.&nbsp; He gradually became convinced that we could 
      deal with the desires of the students and still be deferential to our 
      honorary guest.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Finally we came up with an agreement.&nbsp; 
      Those who wanted to could wear blue armbands with a peace symbol.&nbsp; The 
      president would include in his remarks an explanation of their 
      significance to the students.&nbsp; There would be no student walkouts or peace 
      speeches or other disruptive demonstrations.&nbsp; There would be a moment of 
      silence.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then I had the task of writing the copy 
      that would explain this in Helfferich's address.&nbsp; After he approved it, I 
      asked the student protest leaders to read and approve it, and they did.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;DLH did not become comfortable with the 
      assurances of the leaders until a few days before the event.&nbsp; His original 
      plan was to change the order of business so that he could cut the ceremony 
      short if any disruption took place.&nbsp; At the final instant, he followed the 
      usual order of business.&nbsp; Everything went as planned.&nbsp; Not a single 
      student walked out of the convocation in protest.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preparing to leave, Margaret said, &quot;I 
      want to read that issue of the student paper.&quot; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Check the college archive in the 
      library,&quot; said Bodger.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Check,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;I have a date with 
      my department head to talk about my annual evaluation.&nbsp; I'll look 
      tomorrow.&quot;&nbsp; And she left.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>The social changes on campus were inescapable</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local student issues were harder for 
      Bodger to deal with than the big national issues.&nbsp; &quot;Harder for DLH too,&quot; 
      he said to himself.&nbsp; On balance, the president handled the moratorium and 
      Kent State affairs well because he had a thread of understanding if not of 
      agreement with the youthful protesters.&nbsp; The religious denomination of the 
      college harbored plenty of war resisters.&nbsp; The mounting evidence of the 
      counterproductive nature of the war became increasingly hard to dodge, 
      despite the inclination of conservatives to support the military through 
      thick and thin.&nbsp; The students were insisting on an ethical judgment of the 
      war.&nbsp; That was attractive to DLH.&nbsp; It made him responsive to Bodger's 
      attitude. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no similar thread of 
      understanding to soften his stance on campus social rules.&nbsp; The students 
      year after year battered away at the rules.&nbsp; The college yielded inch by 
      inch.&nbsp; Sometimes, as in 1967, when the dinner dress code fell in an 
      evening of mass protest, it yielded a foot.&nbsp; But the dynamic, for Bodger, 
      was uninformed by anything like enlightened social thinking.&nbsp; He struggled 
      to grasp why the college stood so stiff-necked in the doorway of social 
      change.&nbsp; He tried to counsel students to move gradually and accept small 
      gains gracefully.&nbsp; He finally found himself trying to rationalize the 
      status quo to himself so that he could continue serving Helfferich with a 
      good conscience.&nbsp; For he did feel like an apostate at times.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day Margaret met him for coffee at 
      the Hut, where the old train station once stood.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told him about a woman student, 
      Adrien, who was having trouble studying and sleeping.&nbsp; Her roommate's 
      boyfriend was sleeping over in the room.&nbsp; At first, the boyfriend did not 
      seem to care that Adrien was in the other bed while he bedded with the 
      roommate.&nbsp; Eventually, however, he hinted that he would be happier if she 
      disappeared for the night.&nbsp; The roommate silently confirmed the wish for 
      privacy, and Adrien complied.&nbsp; She bummed around the residence hall, 
      finding a floor here and a sofa there for the night.&nbsp; Her study habits 
      fell victim to her nomadic night life.&nbsp; Margaret learned of this when she 
      called Adrien into her office one day to talk about the drop in her grade 
      in intermediate French.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She empathized with Adrien.&nbsp; Something 
      similar had happened to her when she was an undergraduate.&nbsp; Margaret had 
      marched into the residential dean's office and complained.&nbsp; A rift between 
      her and her roommate had ensued.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dean, however, had maneuvered her 
      into a private room down the hall.&nbsp; Her life had gone on.&nbsp; Her roommate 
      had soon outgrown the charms of her bedmate and had come back to live with 
      Margaret.&nbsp; They forgave each other.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I told Adrien about my experience and 
      recommended a similar course,&quot; said Margaret to Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;So far no help 
      has come.&nbsp; The resident advisor convened a non-judgmental discussion 
      between Adrien and her roommate.&nbsp; The emphasis was on mutual respect.&nbsp; 
      When Adrien said she respected her roommate's romantic attachment to the 
      guy, the discussion ended, with no change in her nightly vagabondage.&nbsp; I 
      want to talk to the president about this.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Something eventually will work out,&quot; 
      Bodger smiled.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You smile.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;At the oceans of distance we have sailed 
      in student administration in my career.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Managing student life seems like a 
      necessary evil,&quot; Margaret said.&nbsp; &quot;Which oceans have you sailed?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On my way to the presidency, I nearly 
      drowned in the sea of student life administration,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; &quot;It was 
      the hardest lesson put in front of me by Helfferich.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Was he that deliberate in designing your 
      apprenticeship?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I will never really know.&nbsp; He was 
      managing the college through the storms of social change.&nbsp; The war in 
      Vietnam was a focal point, but I think the baby boomers' attack on World 
      War II values would have occurred even if the US had avoided the Southeast 
      Asia conflict.&nbsp; With John Kennedy's death in 1963, we entered a time of 
      violence in high places.&nbsp; It set a tone.&nbsp; The highest towers could fall.&nbsp; 
      JFK's death now seems like the beginning of the end of World War II.&nbsp; Kent 
      State seems like the very end.&nbsp; The postmoderns soon were attacking the 
      'hegemony.'&nbsp; That bashing of the establishment encouraged the rising 
      expectations of women and blacks and gays and lesbians, anybody without a 
      piece of the power.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And students,&quot; Margaret added.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Students.&nbsp; Not just female and black.&nbsp; 
      Students who were children of the establishment as well.&nbsp; Even 
      well-mannered students at our college.&nbsp; One of my vivid memories is of a 
      girl named Eileen--she died at forty of cancer--and her band of followers 
      marching down the campus street to dinner one evening, chanting, 
      'One-two-three-four, we won't take your shit no more.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bad grammar,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That was the point,&quot; said Bodger.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What shit wouldn't they take no more?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Guys being banned from visiting women in 
      dorms.&nbsp; Beer being banned from campus altogether.&nbsp; These were the local 
      manifestations of the global uprising against the established system.&nbsp; 
      Even the moratorium, even Kent State didn't displace these chicken shit 
      rules in the minds of the students and some younger faculty.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Oppression, repression are the same even 
      in a Halloween costume,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Correct,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;And sometimes 
      it must have seemed to DLH that he was running a Halloween parade.&nbsp; I 
      happened along, and he picked me up as a usable baton.&nbsp; If I could help 
      him run things, he could assume that what I thought about these things did 
      not much matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was of a generation that could think of my 
      happening along as providential. &nbsp;I can't imagine he would have picked me 
      up so readily if he did not have a blind confidence that my role would 
      work itself out.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did you think you were the wrong baton 
      for his purposes?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I guess I thought that he would have 
      thought I was not the right baton.&nbsp; He watched me wiggle around and 
      agonize about the college social rules.&nbsp; He did not understand fully that 
      I did not understand their symbolic importance in defining an ethical 
      purpose at the root of the institution.&nbsp; But he did see early on that I 
      would drive myself crazy TRYING to understand.&nbsp; I wanted to please him; I 
      wanted to help him. To a few of my colleagues, at least, that had to 
      appear naive.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Self-serving?&quot;&nbsp; Margaret asked with her 
      characteristic tilt of an eyebrow.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, that too.&nbsp; I was self-serving, of 
      course.&nbsp; But not in the customary sense.&nbsp; I was a kind of zealot in search 
      of a cause.&nbsp; There was a sacrificial streak in me that would not go away.&nbsp; 
      It made me indifferent to mere 'getting ahead.'&nbsp; I think that DLH could 
      see that while others could not.&nbsp; Maybe that was at the root of his 
      decision to make me an apprentice for the presidency.&nbsp; That, combined with 
      the sheer need for a tool, a helper, in the midst of the storm.&nbsp; Some of 
      his board members, I later learned, worried about him.&nbsp; Despite his 
      appearance of vigor, he was aging.&nbsp; They wanted him to have someone with 
      legs.&nbsp; Several of them were more vocal in advocating my apprenticeship 
      than I imagined at the time.&nbsp; I think he listened to them.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Student life, then, was the hardest 
      lesson,&quot; said Margaret, &quot;because of the gap between his thinking and 
      yours?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes.&nbsp; And no.&nbsp; Yes, there was that gap, 
      and I had to bridge it if I was to be of use to him in the operation of 
      the college.&nbsp; No, it was not the gap that made it the hardest lesson.&nbsp; 
      What made it the hardest lesson was that DLH himself was reaching 
      unsatisfactorily for an expression of the traditional parental role of a 
      college even as students were denying that role.&nbsp; The courts soon followed 
      in denying it too.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This seems quaint,&quot; said Margaret.&nbsp; &quot;It 
      only matters now because it helps explain how you were moving from 
      apprentice to president.&nbsp; Right?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger thought a moment.&nbsp; &quot;Except that 
      adjudicating the social life of students did not go away when <i>in loco 
      parentis</i> went away--it merely changed form.&nbsp; DLH would have told you 
      we HAD the answer to Adrien's problem long before Adrien was born.&nbsp; Ban 
      the horny cad from the room!&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret protested: &quot;There are feminine 
      issues of freedom and choice.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sure,&quot; Bodger interrupted.&nbsp; &quot;I am 
      talking about the moments of their birth.&nbsp; In this little place, the 
      vocabulary with which to discuss them was old and aching.&nbsp; The president 
      had to use it because he had no other.&nbsp; But he never stopped trying to 
      hear something new.&nbsp; He wanted to reaffirm <i>in loco parentis</i> in 
      terms that would make sense in the 1960s.&nbsp; That is what I came to want 
      too, as a condition of my staying on at the college.&nbsp; Without it, I felt 
      that I would self-destruct.&nbsp; The contradiction of what I was expected to 
      do as an administrator and what I thought about it was too great.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;DLH and I engaged in an ongoing 
      discussion about the policy position of the college.&nbsp; We even called it 
      the 'philosophy' of the college, a limp but comforting word under the 
      circumstances.&nbsp; Memos from me, dropped on his desk like time bombs, 
      punctuated this discussion.&nbsp; He would scrawl his reactions in the 
      margins.&nbsp; I often could predict them, but sometimes he would amaze me by 
      agreeing with a point that seemed to be from the far left.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the summer of 1968, I precipitated 
      his reaction in a more complete form.&nbsp; I was editor of the alumni 
      magazine.&nbsp; I had assumed a fairly free hand in determining content and 
      emphasis.&nbsp; My closeness with students led me to encourage Pat, a bright 
      senior, to give her idea of the purpose of a college in the late 1960s.&nbsp; 
      Of course I knew I would get a polemic for change at our college.&nbsp; I knew 
      her argument would ride the hobbyhorse of what was now being called the 
      'counter culture.'&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew also that I would get a civil, even 
      ameliorative, voice.&nbsp; Before the women of the late '60s learned to express 
      their rights, they learned manners the old-girl way.&nbsp; The combination of 
      fresh outspokenness and social grace produced a posture to be reckoned 
      with, even if the argument for change was laced with the liberationist 
      romanticism of the moment.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pat agreed with many that her generation 
      was in the midst of a world-wide social revolution.&nbsp; It was a revolution 
      against the social 'schizophrenia' caused by the depersonalized technology 
      at the heart of modern mass society.&nbsp; Young people, the first to see 
      clearly into this schizophrenic quality of contemporary life, had to speak 
      out, drop out, or go crazy.&nbsp; Pat took the position that American colleges 
      could fulfill their historic mission by becoming a 'channeling device' for 
      speaking out, the healthiest of the three alternatives.&nbsp; To do that 
      effectively, she argued that they would have to create more realistic 
      social conditions.&nbsp; They would have to be freer, more willing to allow the 
      crossfire of opinion on the street.&nbsp; They would have to be better able to 
      allow students to engage directly, not just intellectually, with the 
      larger issues of the day.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pat's message for her own college grew 
      out of that line of thought.&nbsp; She acknowledged that the social rules, 
      against which she had valiantly fought, might have seemed petty and 
      local.&nbsp; But the college's heavy emphasis on them showed that it did not 
      understand the necessity to encourage students to participate in the 
      critique of the larger social situation in the world.&nbsp; By being obsessed 
      with petty social rules, the college assured that students would also be 
      obsessed with them and ignore the big picture.&nbsp; The college effectively 
      shut down the students' inclination to speak out for a better world at 
      large.&nbsp; The apathy of the majority of our students in the face of the 
      world revolution supported her argument, as she saw it.&nbsp; She even accused 
      herself of a too-narrow focus.&nbsp;&nbsp; She called for a college community as an 
      effective organ of the body of the larger society, there and then, not 
      after commencement.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sounds right to me,&quot; Margaret said, 
      beneficiary, as she was, of the two decades of change that flowed from the 
      activism of the Pats of the world.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pat clearly caught the note of the 
      moment,&quot; Bodger continued.&nbsp; &quot;I had the foresight to show the article to 
      DLH before going to press.&nbsp; He was upset by her direct criticism of our 
      college, however indulgent he might be of her general argument and her 
      civil tone.&nbsp; He denied the logical link between social restrictions and 
      apathy toward 'real world' issues.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He censored the article?&quot; Margaret 
      asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I think there might have been a moment 
      when he wanted to kick me in the shins for having invited Pat to write her 
      piece.&nbsp; He didn't tell me to pull it out, though.&nbsp; Instead, he told me to 
      make room for a comment to accompany the article.&nbsp; This was a space 
      problem, but I managed to squeeze it in with small type.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You ghosted the comment?&quot;&nbsp; Margaret 
      guessed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He wrote it.&nbsp; I edited, but he wrote 
      it.&nbsp; That's how strongly he felt about it.&nbsp; His basic point was that a 
      college is a place for <i>preparing</i> to deal with 'real world' issues.&nbsp; 
      College was not an arena for the 'real world' as such.&nbsp; If he could hold 
      to that distinction, then the social conditions on the campus by 
      definition could be--and should be--different from those in the larger 
      society.&nbsp; When I read her article, I had missed that critical 
      distinction.&nbsp; I admitted to myself that he had a point.&nbsp; It was probably 
      the biggest step I had taken so far in the struggle to grasp the so-called 
      philosophy of the college on social matters.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But he missed her point,&quot; Margaret 
      said.&nbsp; &quot;They talked past each other.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Categorically, yes.&nbsp; Practically, no.&nbsp; 
      DLH did not deny that the social conditions of a college could change 
      without destroying its preparatory function.&nbsp; But he did insist that its 
      function was categorically preparatory.&nbsp; Pat did not deny that a college 
      had a preparatory function even as she insisted on making the social 
      conditions more like those of the real world.&nbsp; But she did insist that the 
      social conditions categorically must change.&nbsp; It was in the practical 
      overlap of their positions that I took a smidgeon of comfort.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hut was filling with young families 
      coming for early pizza dinner.&nbsp; A paper plate winged by a sneaker-clad kid 
      in a nearby booth missed Margaret's head by a few inches.&nbsp; She made a move 
      to leave.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm talking to a group of 
      non-traditional-age students tonight,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;All women.&nbsp; Trying to 
      balance work and studies.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What will you tell them?&quot; Bodger asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'Hang in there.&nbsp; You have your rights.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; At home after dinner, 
      Bodger took down the bound volume of magazines from the 1960s and found 
      that his recollection of the article and Helfferich's comment was fairly 
      accurate.&nbsp; The comment by DLH on Pat's article evoked a memory of many 
      moments in his office when in clipped exchanges they talked about the tilt 
      of the institution.&nbsp; DLH wrote:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I enjoyed reading Pat's article 
      because as I know her, she has a serious concern for the welfare of higher 
      education.&nbsp; However, I see the relationship between a college and the 
      &quot;real&quot; world in a rather different light.&nbsp; A college cannot--and in my 
      view should not--be completely representative of the society around it.&nbsp; A 
      college has a special purpose, the transmission of accumulated knowledge 
      and the stimulation of young intellects to add to that store of knowledge 
      and perhaps thereby someday to attain wisdom.&nbsp; A college must limit itself 
      to particular functions if it is to achieve such an ambitious purpose.&nbsp; It 
      cannot hope to provide all the confrontations with reality that go into 
      making the well-developed individual.&nbsp; Perhaps the best it can do is to <b>
      pose the right questions</b> about what Pat calls a &quot;viable philosophy&quot; 
      and to make possible a sampling of the experiences that lie in wait after 
      graduation.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that as presently structured 
      our own college is capable of channeling the tensions that students 
      experience.&nbsp; I do not believe it is unrealistic to have rules on alcohol, 
      dormitory visits, women's hours and the like....</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without giving up their civil rights, 
      students are in a kind of voluntary servitude to the words and thoughts of 
      others.&nbsp; They do not often realize that very soon that servitude will end 
      and they no longer will be classed as students.&nbsp; It is only when they 
      cease to be students that they can become truly effective agents within 
      the body of society.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Pat, I want our students to be 
      more concerned with the burning social issues of the day than they 
      are....But I hope they spend the great portion of their time in thoughtful 
      preparation in basic knowledge so that they will have enlightened concern 
      when they take up the business of running the world.&nbsp; I believe my 
      generation does better than did former generations and that the next 
      generation will do better than mine....</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone has called the colleges and 
      universities important co-trustees of civilization.&nbsp; Our college cannot 
      maintain that role and be a place where undergraduates are exempt from the 
      consequences of their own action or inaction.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That last paragraph, thought 
      Bodger, was a zinger out of Helfferich's combative past.&nbsp; He would have 
      envisioned it bringing his conservative alumni and board supporters to 
      their feet cheering.&nbsp; And he would have seen it hoisting the youthful 
      insurgents on their own petard of independence and freedom.&nbsp; After all 
      these years, Bodger also saw that it undercut DLH's own argument.&nbsp; If the 
      college was a place for preparation and not a &quot;real-world&quot; component, it
      <i>did</i> exempt itself--and presumably its students--from some of the 
      conditions of the real world.&nbsp; How could it then be a full-fledged 
      co-trustee of the whole civilization?&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat never had a chance to comment 
      on the comment.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In hindsight, Bodger could see 
      Helfferich's comment as a milestone on the road to the end of <i>in loco 
      parentis</i> as a legal doctrine.&nbsp; It would not have occurred to DLH or to 
      Bodger at that time that the college soon would lose its ability to 
      declare students in &quot;voluntary servitude&quot; or that their civil rights would 
      dramatically expand on campus as well as off.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hindsight also gave him a clear view of 
      the lessons he was painfully learning as the president's apprentice.&nbsp; Even 
      after so many years, DLH's leniency toward Bodger's invitation to Pat 
      struck him as remarkable.&nbsp; None of them had time to reflect on the tactics 
      required to navigate in the changing tides.&nbsp; DLH was energetic for his age 
      but he was of his age.&nbsp; In retrospect, it appeared that he looked to 
      Bodger for a flow of actions that might help and probably would not harm.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>The college entered a new era of social 
      justice</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day at the supermarket Bodger ran 
      into Margaret and Antoine.&nbsp; They were holding hands as they cruised the 
      junk food aisle.&nbsp; He was a new member of the faculty, hired since Bodger's 
      departure from the presidency.&nbsp; Margaret introduced Antoine to Bodger as 
      the newest member of the communication arts department.&nbsp; Bodger wished him 
      well.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He's different,&quot; Margaret told Bodger 
      later.&nbsp; &quot;I like him.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger had not talked to her about her 
      personal life before.&nbsp; The survivors of graduate school who did not marry 
      a fellow student usually had social make-up work to do when they started 
      teaching after getting the Ph.D.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm glad to see an African-American come 
      to the faculty,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;We have so few.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He worried about attitudes here before 
      he took the job,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Understandable.&nbsp; The matter of race in 
      the 1990s could not be much more complicated than it is, here and 
      elsewhere.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;After we met you at the 
      supermarket, he wondered what I would think you thought about our having 
      something going.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That seems anachronistic,&quot; Bodger said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did you think about it?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I thought how good it is that the 
      college has come this far in the thirty-some years I have been involved.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I didn't think about it until Antoine 
      thought about it.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's good too.&nbsp; In the '60s, when I 
      was starting out here, we were just touching the surface.&nbsp; The number of 
      minority students was low.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's still not high,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But higher.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one on the staff was of 
      color.&nbsp; Black students had a hard time being seen and heard as people with 
      different needs and outlooks.&nbsp; The entire emphasis, such as it was, came 
      down on equal rights, not on multicultural legitimacy.&nbsp; That was the 
      thrust of the federal civil rights legislation that went into effect only 
      a couple of years before.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How did the college react to the new 
      push?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Black issues were simmering, along with 
      protests of the war, along with the itch of many students to push basic 
      changes in the structure of all mainstream institutions.&nbsp; The college's 
      historic principle of openness to different ethnic and religious 
      applicants was a fortunate matter of official record.&nbsp; It was expressed in 
      our original charter of 1869.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In reality, however, most of the people 
      here had little zeal for getting out in front on minority student 
      recruitment.&nbsp; We rightly celebrated our few black students for their 
      inherent ability to make the grade on their own merits in our program.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The majority white kids were making about as many waves as we could ride.&nbsp; 
      The student government was pushing for a new student bill of rights.&nbsp; If 
      adopted, it would have had the effect of voiding all the social rules over 
      which we constantly wrangled.&nbsp; If you look at the student newspaper from 
      the late '60s, you find a steady stream of bitching about just about every 
      aspect of the college, from the bathrooms in the dorms to the 
      socio-economic make-up of the board and administration.&nbsp; The students were 
      unhappy in part because their options were few.&nbsp; It was hard for them to 
      transfer to another college.&nbsp; Dropping out meant that the guys might be 
      drafted for Vietnam.&nbsp; Keeping the lid on all of the unrest and maintaining 
      a style of civility and considerateness at the same time took massive 
      energy and imagination.&nbsp; It took a lot of seat-of-the-pants 
      decision-making.&nbsp; The administration was not out looking for an additional 
      crisis agenda.&nbsp; Neither students nor faculty felt the urgency to push the 
      administration very hard on racial justice.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;This was not a proud 
      moment.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Don't misunderstand.&nbsp; There was much 
      good will and even good intention.&nbsp; There was less organized action for a 
      while.&nbsp; Then there was organized action!&nbsp; Black issues were an important 
      part of my apprenticeship in college administration in the late '60s.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Antoine is cooking late dinner,&quot; 
      Margaret said and was gone.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Alone, Bodger ordered the events of 1969 
      that he would tell her about some other time.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he thought, the college was 
      fortunate to be associated with the United Church of Christ.&nbsp; It had a 
      broad vision of human relationships and was as militant as any mainstream 
      Protestant church in supporting civil rights and social justice.&nbsp; In the 
      summer of '69, the church's Social Action Commission of the Pennsylvania 
      Southeast Conference convened a meeting on the campus.&nbsp; Bodger and the 
      college's assistant for alumni and church affairs made what amounted to a 
      command appearance.&nbsp; Some 35 people were there, virtually none from the 
      college community itself.&nbsp; They were the voices for justice.&nbsp; Bodger now 
      thought of them as the canaries in the coal mine.&nbsp; They did the college a 
      service.&nbsp; But at the time, they made him mad.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Commission had received a complaint 
      against the college from a group of inner-city ministers and laypersons.&nbsp; 
      &quot;Do-nothing-ism!&quot;&nbsp; Bodger remembered the self-righteous anger of the white 
      leader of the Commission.&nbsp; He was a young preacher filled with the zeal 
      for liberation that crackled in the air of the '60s.&nbsp; How easy it seemed 
      then for people to feel absolutely right.&nbsp;&nbsp; The young preacher spoke <i>as
      </i>the complainant, not just <i>for </i>the complainants, whoever they 
      were.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger felt poorly cast as the defender 
      of an alleged &quot;do-nothing&quot; college record.&nbsp; In his years at the gas 
      company, he had been a soldier in the movement to connect the company with 
      the rising expectations of the black community of Philadelphia.&nbsp; The Equal 
      Opportunities Industrialization project under Leon Sullivan had early 
      backing from the company.&nbsp; The company head, Charles Simpson, saw the 
      oncoming movement of black people into the mainstream of professional 
      leadership and into the turf of white workers.&nbsp; He embraced Sullivan under 
      the guise of idealism.&nbsp; But he justified his actions to a socially 
      conservative board and management under the banner of corporate 
      practicality: the work force and the customers of the future would be 
      increasingly black, and the company should move with the wave of change.&nbsp; 
      When affirmative action laws came along a little later, the company stood 
      on firmer ground than most employers in the Delaware Valley.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enabled by the Simpson agenda, Bodger had 
      the luck to hire and supervise the first black member of the company 
      management.&nbsp; Masco Young was a bright black man about town who wrote a 
      kind of gossip column for a venerable black newspaper.&nbsp; He had a degree in 
      journalism from the University of Illinois.&nbsp; Masco had the high-wire 
      skills of a man who knew how to walk without a net on the thin line of 
      white permission.&nbsp; He forgave America because he saw it under the pressure 
      that would force it to change.&nbsp; He became Bodger's tutor in the praxis of 
      dismantling the barriers erected against blacks.&nbsp; To other blacks, he 
      might have looked like a Tom or a sheer opportunist; to Bodger's white 
      company colleagues, he might have looked like a token.&nbsp; To Bodger, 
      however, he was an instructor who knew that he had a willing pupil.&nbsp; He 
      was usually moving from where he was, in front of Bodger, to someplace 
      else, more compelling, over on the other side of things.&nbsp; He went 
      typically with his cigarette in an onyx holder jauntily clenched in his 
      teeth.&nbsp; He was supposed to be helping Bodger with corporate communications 
      and the writing of personnel policies.&nbsp; Mainly he was injecting a new 
      perspective into the mind of the management of the company.&nbsp; Bodger was 
      his principal hypodermic needle.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger's job exposed him to employees 
      throughout the company, in the pipe repair gangs on the street as well as 
      in the cadre of office workers around the city.&nbsp; He found it easy to 
      befriend people at all levels of the company.&nbsp;&nbsp; After Masco arrived, he 
      worked more assiduously to maintain contact with the numerous black 
      workers with whom he had struck up acquaintances.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the '60s, the American agenda on race 
      seemed simple and achievable.&nbsp; The discriminatory barriers, overt and 
      covert, had to be dislodged, by legal and all other means.&nbsp; The separatist 
      impulse inherent in the multicultural movement to come later still 
      simmered at the margin of public attention.&nbsp; &quot;Black pride&quot; in Bodger's 
      view was mainly a means of <i>overcoming</i> barriers.&nbsp; It was not yet an 
      end in itself.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger's enthusiasm for opposing 
      discrimination did not owe much to the sting of personal experience.&nbsp; His 
      growing up in a small industrial town made up largely of central European 
      immigrant families precluded a direct encounter with the condition of 
      black America.&nbsp; The few black students in his school days had deep roots 
      in the town, probably going back to freedmen families in the pre-civil war 
      period.&nbsp; They were accepted because they were excepted.&nbsp; He had a few 
      black co-workers on the labor gang at the iron company during summer break 
      from college; their individual presence in his mind, however, could not 
      adequately represent the issue of discrimination in its collective 
      magnitude in the American heart.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger's visceral egalitarian bent, which 
      came from within himself, received its support mainly from his reading in 
      college and after.&nbsp; His professor of sociology, Jessie Miller, introduced 
      him to Gunnar Myrdal's <i>An American Dilemma</i> in his sophomore 
      year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a good sophomore, he was astounded by it and by his 
      instructor's attitude.&nbsp; To her all-white, middle-class audience, she was 
      teaching social science, but her intention was to prick consciences.&nbsp; The 
      metaphor of the spiral lay at the heart of Myrdal's presentation of the 
      social dilemma of America.&nbsp; The spiral of black deprivation would continue 
      to spin downward, to worsen and worsen, if the conditions of 
      discrimination and denial continued.&nbsp; Conversely, it would reverse and 
      spin upward toward better social conditions as the discrimination and 
      denial decreased.&nbsp; It was one of the lasting lessons of his life.&nbsp; Jessie 
      Miller reinforced the deep-felt notion in Bodger's mind that the 
      justification of scholarship was not in its purported revelation of 
      objective truth but in its service to action, to life itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Years 
      later, he read Alfred North Whitehead's observation that knowledge keeps 
      no better than fish, that it has to be used in order to have value--Gunnar 
      Myrdal and Jessie Miller revalidated.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger later read Richard Wright's<i> 
      Native Son</i> with the eyes of a true believer in social determinism.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      When he read the text of James Baldwin's <i>Notes of a Native Son</i>, he 
      knew that the matter of race was more complex than he could understand: 
      the statuesque sentences seemed to burn with a fire that, no matter how 
      hot, failed to consume them.&nbsp; He read all that Baldwin wrote with the 
      deepening sense that a tragedy beyond his ken stalked those sentences.&nbsp; 
      While he saw that Baldwin spoke of a dimension he would never enter, 
      Bodger at the same time took reinforcement from Baldwin.&nbsp; His writing to 
      that point made it evident what had to be done in the '60s.&nbsp; The day would 
      later come for the deeper call in Baldwin's voice, to the fire itself.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger entered the meeting of the 
      Commission with his own sense of righteousness.&nbsp; In recent weeks, he had 
      been a proponent of starting a summer pre-freshman program for admitted 
      students who were socio-economically disadvantaged.&nbsp; He had done much of 
      the detail work to get it up and running later in the summer.&nbsp; He had been 
      on a campaign of his own to identify qualified black students for 
      admission to the college.&nbsp; He had been actively cultivating the leader of 
      the black students on campus and had even had a major conflict with his 
      administrative colleagues over that.&nbsp; He was a vocal participant among 
      faculty members on the need for the college to identify and recruit 
      qualified young blacks with scholarship aid.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the young preacher poured his ire on 
      the college for sitting on its hands in the teeth of a revolutionary need, 
      Bodger at first was combative and defensive.&nbsp; He took the criticisms of 
      the college to be criticisms of himself.&nbsp; Before the meeting ended, he 
      realized his mistake.&nbsp; The confrontation began to sound like a 
      conversation.&nbsp; Both sides remained wary until the end.&nbsp; The madcap humor 
      of the politics of '60s youth did not reach as far as conferences such as 
      this.&nbsp; The mood was grim to the end.&nbsp; The Commission left in the late 
      night.&nbsp; Bodger maintained an informal liaison with the young preacher and 
      a black inner-city minister for a couple of years.&nbsp; Like the joining of so 
      many passionate issues in those years, the confrontation of church and 
      college simply became tired.&nbsp; Interests changed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>A black student alliance sought recognition</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Antoine cooks Creole,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger and she were together again.&nbsp; They 
      regularly were meeting for coffee on Wednesday afternoons at the Hut. &nbsp;She 
      seemed to have acquired a taste for the pieces of Bodger's 
      pre-presidential years.&nbsp; He dished them out to her as if they were 
      specials of the day to go with the coffee.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So I finally had my climactic episode in 
      black issues,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;It had nothing to do with confrontations with 
      preachers.&nbsp; The outcome had more to do with my apprenticeship in college 
      management than with the welfare of black students as such.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We had a small handful of black 
      students.&nbsp; Byron was the only one I knew who had it in him to take an 
      initiative.&nbsp; I befriended him.&nbsp; We talked about his plans to go to 
      graduate school.&nbsp; I told him about my involvement in breaking down 
      barriers in the corporate world.&nbsp; I told him about my acquaintances from 
      the work force at the company.&nbsp; They had kids who might go to college.&nbsp; We 
      talked about the fire in James Baldwin's sentences.&nbsp; He came to trust me.&nbsp; 
      I trusted him.&nbsp; I came to believe that he would not willy-nilly trash the 
      place out of revenge.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the spring of '68, black students at 
      Columbia and Trinity and elsewhere held sit-ins to protest for student 
      rights.&nbsp; In early '69, black students sat in at Swarthmore's admissions 
      office, and the president, Courtney Smith, simultaneously died of a heart 
      attack in his early fifties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a shocker.&nbsp; Helfferich and most 
      of our administrative group knew Smith--I did not know him myself.&nbsp; He was 
      an elegant man who, in retrospect, looked poorly equipped to fight the 
      kind of nastiness emerging on campuses.&nbsp; Our campus had already been 
      through two big conflicts in two years, not counting the unending argument 
      over social rules, which climaxed at the football field in the spring of 
      '69.&nbsp; We had the shock of conflict over Madalyn Murray O'Hair's appearance 
      in '67 and the non-renewal of contracts of two young untenured faculty 
      members in '68.&nbsp; DLH was out to prove that he was no Courtney Smith in 
      '69.&nbsp; That death hardened his position on student discipline.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He took an especially dim view of black 
      student protest because of the prominence of black student protesters at 
      the time of Smith's death.&nbsp; But of course bizarre concatenations of events 
      were a commonplace in those days.&nbsp; So it was not a surprise that, at the 
      moment of Smith's death, Byron and his quiet supporters were organizing a 
      black student alliance on our campus.&nbsp; He wanted to test the college by 
      writing a constitution and seeking formal approval for its existence.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret guessed: &quot;You played on your 
      friendship with Byron and persuaded him not to do it?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not exactly.&nbsp; DLH declared in a meeting 
      of administrators that he would oppose the constitution.&nbsp; He assumed that 
      it would exclude all students from membership except minority students.&nbsp; 
      That would enable him to declare it discriminatory and contrary to a 
      founding principle of the college.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Meanwhile, Byron came to me with his 
      draft of the constitution, sent by one of my colleagues in English who was 
      on the student activities committee.&nbsp; Byron wanted my advice before taking 
      his proposal to the student activities committee.&nbsp; I will never be certain 
      whether my response to him was naive, manipulative, or simply 
      administratively pragmatic.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You rewrote his constitution!&quot; Margaret 
      said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You're getting to know me,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; 
      &quot;Knowing of DLH's opposition to an exclusive alliance of any kind based on 
      race, I could have--should have, some thought--told him to ice the whole 
      idea.&nbsp; Instead, seeking accommodation, I gave him suggestions, aimed at 
      making the group an interlocking part of the campus life.&nbsp; If he followed 
      my suggestions, he would keep the organization from becoming a separate 
      'alien' entity.&nbsp; I thought that would be in the spirit of the president's 
      thought.&nbsp; I cautioned Byron to keep my advice between us.&nbsp; I felt pretty 
      good about our exchange.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Word got back to DLH and the other 
      administrators that a draft was going forward.&nbsp; DLH convened four of us at 
      lunch to discuss what to do.&nbsp; One of my colleagues said rumor had it that 
      I had written the draft.&nbsp; 'Is that right?' he asked.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A loyalty test,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You bet.&nbsp; I realized I was on thin ice.&nbsp; 
      In the O'Hair affair, and in other touchy situations, I tried to keep DLH 
      informed of my position and what I would be trying to do.&nbsp; In this 
      instance I was out in front of him, caught flatfooted!&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The president forgave you,&quot; said 
      Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That was not exactly what was at stake,&quot; 
      Bodger said.&nbsp; &quot;Later he made light of my embarrassment in front of the 
      other administrators and my attempt to rationalize the advice I gave 
      Byron.&nbsp; That only came after the follow-up to my abortive 
      constitution-drafting.&nbsp; Right after that luncheon meeting, I crawled back 
      into my shell and resolved on two courses of action.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;First I would draft a statement of 
      policy on students and black awareness.&nbsp; I would give this to DLH as a way 
      of opening a discussion with him about the ongoing response to black 
      student activism, which we all expected.&nbsp; I would recommend that he take 
      it to the board for approval.&nbsp;&nbsp; That would cement our position, clarify 
      his intentions and mine and give us something to say when the issue 
      reached the media, as we expected it to.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Second, I would suggest that the 
      president create a task force on black awareness, with students, faculty, 
      and board members.&nbsp; Since DLH would not soften his stance against the 
      black student alliance, I thought such an alternative structure could be a 
      productive lightning rod.&nbsp; It would be a legitimate venue for airing the 
      gripes of the students.&nbsp; I thought I could persuade Byron that this would 
      be a better fruit of conflict than the approval of a student group to 
      which the college could turn a tin ear.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Both steps took place.&nbsp; With a little 
      stiffening here and there, the policy statement went to the board and it 
      was approved.&nbsp; The task force produced an action agenda that gave us a 
      framework for moving black issues through the life of the college in a 
      manageable way.&nbsp; In the ensuing years there were many tense moments.&nbsp; 
      Black students were edgy.&nbsp; The college was always in danger of becoming 
      merely defensive or doing too little.&nbsp; Conflicts across the nation kept us 
      aware of the need to get on with racial justice while they also kept 
      everyone on pins and needles.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b>Bodger became vice president for administrative 
      affairs</b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span style="text-decoration:none">&nbsp;</span></u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      &quot;When the dust settled on these two steps, DLH referred to the implication 
      at lunch that day--that I was in collusion with students against the 
      president's intentions.&nbsp; I said I thought my skin was getting pretty 
      hardened to such implications.&nbsp; He said on that day he thought my skin was 
      pretty thin.&nbsp; I allowed that I was embarrassed.&nbsp; He said it amused him.&nbsp; 
      Then he went on to tell me that I had been helpful to him.&nbsp; I was making 
      him lazy, he said.&nbsp; He told me I would get a raise for the following year 
      at what seemed like a princely percentage to me at the time.&nbsp; And he 
      advised me to set my price a year or two hence at an even higher number.&quot;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I see you playing a role for him and 
      learning what it was all about for yourself,&quot; Margaret said.&nbsp; &quot;I vote that 
      you showed pragmatic administrative action, not naivete or dastardly 
      manipulativeness.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The young always are more clear-eyed,&quot; 
      said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;I used to acquit myself the same.&nbsp; Now, looking back at it 
      all, I would not be so quick to judge myself favorably.&nbsp; But it is certain 
      I was learning what managing the college was about.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Seems like a lot of tactical 
      skirmishing,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Seems so.&nbsp; These episodes with students 
      were embedded in a denser narrative.&nbsp; I was only partly aware of what it 
      was saying.&nbsp;&nbsp; Helfferich's approval in spite of monumental mistakes kept 
      me going onward.&nbsp; One day in the spring of '69, in the midst of a scrap 
      within the administrative team about student rules, he told me I would be 
      named vice president for administrative affairs.&nbsp; The academic dean would 
      be named vice president for academic affairs.&nbsp; Our scrap was inopportune 
      and nearly scuttled DLH's plan.&nbsp; He gave me a reflective talk on getting 
      along and going along for the good of the order.&nbsp; This meant I had to try 
      harder to stand fast for the college's position on student behavior.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;While continuing to teach, I became 
      responsible for running the non-educational side of the college, closely 
      watched by the president.&nbsp; My main duty had been and remained promotion, 
      alumni affairs, and fund-raising.&nbsp; But now the business manager, athletics 
      director, and miscellaneous other functions reported to me.&nbsp; I was eager.&nbsp; 
      Helfferich urged me to absorb everything I could.&nbsp; I remained his personal 
      assistant, sat in with him on meetings of all kinds, continued to write 
      letters and articles for him.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Student affairs were the dean's and the 
      president's.&nbsp; Not mine.&nbsp; DLH thus put some formal distance between the 
      student life stew pot and me.&nbsp; I told the dean I would be cautious with 
      students and would always let him know if I was dealing with a student 
      policy issue.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was good for all of us that I became 
      so busy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not spend as much time with students.&nbsp; Even so, they 
      knew I would listen to anything they wanted to say.&nbsp; I was still an easy 
      door for them to open.&nbsp; But they had a harder time finding unqualified 
      support.&nbsp; No more daredevil posturing from me.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You grew up,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;At age 39, a little late.&nbsp; But not 
      completely.&nbsp; I behaved more discreetly. DLH encouraged me more than ever 
      to think like a president.&nbsp; Privately, and for my own satisfaction, not 
      his, I set out to find common ground between the position Pat took in her 
      article and the position DLH espoused.&nbsp; He could not couch the 
      institutional position in terms that made any sense in the climate of the 
      youth culture.&nbsp; He was sure of what he believed about the fallibility of 
      the human being and the need for structures in the face of that 
      fallibility.&nbsp; His entire Pennsylvania Dutch heritage shored up his resolve 
      to deal pragmatically, without nonsense, with the radical ambitions of the 
      youth movement.&nbsp; Rhetorically, however, he mainly persuaded his 
      conservative supporters and himself.&nbsp; The kids were deaf to his arguments.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For their part, the students who were 
      pushing for change--not all were--talked mainly in code words and 
      ideological scraps.&nbsp; The Free Speech Movement at Berkeley happened five 
      years before.&nbsp; Its inchoate agenda set the tone.&nbsp; Jerry Rubin was 
      yippifying the nation.&nbsp; The fallout from the upheavals of the summer of 
      '68 in Europe came to our students in the form of anti-establishment 
      snippets.&nbsp; Timothy Leary rhapsodized drugs.&nbsp; The cynical analysis of the 
      government's handling of Vietnam permeated the day's atmosphere.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Where did you find common ground?&quot; asked 
      Margaret.&nbsp; She left the question hanging in air as she left to meet

      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, Bodger studied the 
      photograph of DLH on the cover of a special issue of the college magazine, 
      published as a commemoration after his death in 1984.&nbsp; The photo was taken 
      in January 1970 in the great hall of the Franklin Institute in 
      Philadelphia.&nbsp; The college held a black tie dinner there in conjunction 
      with the year-long celebration of its centennial. The photo showed him 
      silver-maned in profile, standing at a lectern in front of the fluted 
      Greek columns of the great hall.&nbsp; He was raising his left hand royally 
      toward the unseen audience, eyes uplifted.&nbsp; Bodger recalled the massive 
      marble figure of Benjamin Franklin, just out of the camera's range, 
      majestically looking into the truth of things there in the hall named for 
      him.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Helfferich was in his last six 
      months of office.&nbsp; He was in a mood to give his last lecture, to lay out 
      the truth, once and for all.&nbsp;&nbsp; The words he spoke at the moment the photo 
      was shot were a peculiar blend of ideas.&nbsp; They would never have come 
      together as they did if DLH had not hitched Bodger to his wagon five years 
      before.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Helfferich had a need to make a dramatic 
      statement, a formulaic summation of the essence of the institution.&nbsp; That 
      need was personal as well as institutional.&nbsp; He was coming to the end of 
      his presidency; the institution was coming to the end of its first hundred 
      years of existence.&nbsp; He felt an urgency to characterize the place so that 
      its uniqueness, its special destiny, would be reinforced and propelled 
      forward.&nbsp; He had an increasingly compelling feeling about the waning of 
      his presidency.&nbsp; Time for him was running out.&nbsp; He wanted to do all he 
      could to prevent the same from happening to the institution.&nbsp; As long as 
      he was on the scene, he doubtless felt confident that he could manifest 
      the essential institution in his being, in the daily drama of his 
      executive acts.&nbsp; The idea behind his acts, however, would have to live 
      independent of him when he no longer was president.&nbsp; He had to give it 
      expression.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the cover photo, Bodger 
      realized now that Helfferich's own mortality was at issue as he had not 
      realized it then.&nbsp; By nailing down the place of the college, by assuring 
      that it had a particular future, he could suppress his mounting feeling of 
      fleetingness.&nbsp; It fitted his long-honed skills in theater to undertake 
      such a feat on stage, with an approving audience, dressed to the nines, 
      under the giant sculpture of America's first and foremost sage, with a 
      script pretending to be for the ages.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For his part, Bodger had a need to find 
      an expression of the college's purpose that would enable him to continue 
      in its service with less personal conflict.&nbsp; After his embroilment in the 
      black student constitution, the dean in a private talk urged him to 
      reconsider whether he really belonged in a conservative place like this.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's a fair question,&quot; Bodger said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He decided to look at conservatism more 
      closely.&nbsp; He now wanted to come to grips with a concept with which he 
      instinctively felt uncomfortable.&nbsp; It was clear that it was the operative 
      concept in Helfferich's world.&nbsp; Bodger would have to make peace with it if 
      his career at the college was to have any chance of continuing.&nbsp; His 
      faculty friends had the luxury of voicing liberal sentiments under the 
      protection of academic freedom.&nbsp; As an administrator, Bodger had a 
      different and more difficult ideological project.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">He read Clinton Rossiter's
      <i>Conservatism in America</i> (1955) and Russell Kirk's <i>The 
      Conservative Mind, from Burke to Santayana</i> (1953).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rediscovered 
      a thread of thought in Burke that he had not understood in his graduate 
      school study of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; In doing so, he became aware 
      again of the shallow and unshapely body of what purported to be his formal 
      learning in English literature.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day in the fall of 1969, the 
      president told him of his goal of bringing strong new men to the board of 
      directors of the college.&nbsp; He wanted to beef it up before his departure 
      from office the next spring.&nbsp; It was a given that they would be 
      conservative.&nbsp; He wanted to construct a &quot;case&quot; that would persuade them of 
      the importance of joining the college board.&nbsp; He asked Bodger to help.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assignment coincided with Bodger's 
      reading of Rossiter and Kirk.&nbsp; Late one night he drafted a letter to a 
      prospective new board member.&nbsp; He found the draft among his papers.&nbsp; 
      Reading it after nearly thirty years, he imagined Margaret's bemused smile 
      at some of its pronouncements:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TO A PROSPECTIVE DIRECTOR:</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have been asked to consider 
      serving on the board of directors.&nbsp; You may wonder what allegiance you 
      would be pledging if you accepted the invitation.&nbsp; What is our college 
      that it should win your interest and time and support?</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We who now serve as board members will 
      try to put into words the philosophical temper the college represents.&nbsp; We 
      will also explain why we think its outlook is important today and why it 
      should assure the college of a respected and unusual position in 
      independent higher education.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you find yourself in general 
      agreement with us, we respectfully suggest that by joining us you would 
      find an avenue for the expression of some personal concerns about the 
      direction of our national life; and would specifically gain an opportunity 
      to have your convictions heard in higher educational matters.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As interested laymen, we approve of 
      much that is happening in higher education--the emphasis on rigorous 
      standards, the improving of facilities.&nbsp; There is much also that we 
      disapprove of--the breakdown of administrative leadership, the abandonment 
      of reasonable student rules.&nbsp; But rather than deal with specific issues, 
      about which there may be honest differences of opinion, let us give for 
      your consideration a characterization of the general outlook that we see 
      at our college.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be made clear at the start 
      that our college is firmly committed to<u> liberal </u>education.&nbsp; Like 
      all liberal arts institutions of any distinction, ours holds to the 
      position that a professor of a discipline has the freedom to profess his 
      knowledge untrammeled by considerations other than the demands of truth.&nbsp; 
      The college has no closed ideological system to advocate.&nbsp; It assumes that 
      the answers to the important questions about God, man, nature and society 
      are open to honest doubt and are subject to free discussion and debate in 
      the classroom.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, an educational 
      institution is more than the sum of its classroom experiences.&nbsp; The 
      college participates corporately in American society.&nbsp; As a discrete 
      social and legal entity, it makes decisions--about courses to be included 
      in the curriculum, about the size and shape of the physical plant, about 
      the extent of community involvement, about student rules, about candidates 
      for faculty positions, about students seeking admission, etc.&nbsp; Taken 
      together, these decisions express an institutional point of view.&nbsp; This 
      point of view, essentially philosophical, is the product of the attitudes 
      and ideas of those governing and operating the colleges--about the nature 
      of man, the aims of educating men endowed with that nature, the ways of 
      regulating human affairs in general and in an academic setting in 
      particular.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the word &quot;political&quot; where we 
      say &quot;philosophical,&quot; Robert Paul Wolff, professor of philosophy at 
      Columbia University, recently made the same point as follows: &quot;Every 
      university expresses a number of positive value commitments through the 
      character of its faculty, of its library, even through the buildings it 
      chooses to build...No institution can remain politically neutral in its 
      interaction with society or in the conduct and organization of its 
      internal affairs.&quot; (<u>The Ideal of the University</u>, Beacon Press, 
      1969).</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clear enough to us, then, that 
      an academically excellent college such as ours can and should maintain a 
      neutrality of values as a<u> method</u> of teaching subjects; and at the 
      same time, as an organization in society, maintain a commitment to a set 
      of values, or, perhaps more aptly put, a predisposition to a distinctive 
      philosophical temper.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At our college this temper 
      historically has been conservative.&nbsp; It is our belief that both the 
      institution itself and the society to which it is an important contributor 
      will be best served if a conservative outlook is maintained.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In seeking to define the conservatism 
      of the college, we could look to its origins and link its present-day 
      temper with the careful pietism of its religious founders in the German 
      Reformed Church.&nbsp; It may be more meaningful for you, however, if we take 
      that religious foundation as given and try to describe the college's 
      outlook in terms that are more general than strictly religious ones would 
      be.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we see it, conservatism at our 
      college is not mindless opposition or willful blindness to the upheavals 
      all around us in higher education and American life.&nbsp; Nor is it a naive 
      belief that change can somehow be forestalled; it recognizes, perhaps even 
      more clearly than the most revolutionist doctrine, that change is the 
      essence of history, and it is the first business of men to manage change.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attitude of our college is that a 
      change in an existing structure or relationship should be encouraged only 
      after the most thoroughgoing study of its concrete effects on people and 
      institutions.&nbsp; It distrusts doctrines and programs that, by neat logical 
      argument, promise to solve every problem.&nbsp; It distrusts policies that 
      depend for success on the naturally good inclinations of people or that 
      take for granted the basic reasonableness of men.&nbsp; It holds that people 
      still have to <u>learn </u>to be good, often through bitter experience; 
      and that, although our rational powers make us unique among living beings, 
      they are harnessed to emotional drives that still shock or exalt us 
      because they are beyond our understanding and sometimes our control.&nbsp; It 
      distrusts innovations that tend to throw men back on their independent 
      resources of mind and emotion, or to turn them away from a shared 
      tradition to a private world of uncharted experience.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the college's 
      attitude trusts a practice or an institution which has proven its 
      effectiveness through experience.&nbsp; It trusts economic, religious, 
      educational and social structures which have mediated successfully among 
      the unbridled ideas and feelings of individuals.&nbsp; It trusts that which 
      already is existing and working rather than that which is merely a 
      theory.&nbsp; It trusts a practice that tends to give people a sense of being 
      rooted in an ongoing, unbroken tradition, whether the tradition be 
      religious, cultural, patriotic, or whatever.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For historical antecedents of this 
      temper, we might turn first to Edmund Burke.&nbsp; In his speeches as a member 
      of the House of Commons, and especially in his <u>Reflections on the 
      Revolution in France,</u> Burke fathered the strain of evolutionary 
      conservatism in British and American public philosophy which we believe is 
      alive today at our college.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his reliance on custom, in his fear 
      of applying simplistic rational formulas to human affairs, in his 
      insistence on the importance of experiment and experience in making&nbsp; 
      judgments, in his habitual attitude of doubt about the ability of men to 
      manage themselves without reference to the successful attempts to do so in 
      the past--in all this, we see something of our college's attitude.&nbsp; Burke 
      said that to provide for human needs governments must control the 
      passions, and that &quot;in this sense the restraints on men, as well as their 
      liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights.&quot;&nbsp; With this the spirit 
      of our college concurs.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is hardly called for here 
      to trace the complete history of the conservative outlook, we note that in 
      its evolutionary, moderate Burkean form, it had a profound influence on 
      the founding of the United States through the thinking of such men as 
      Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay (the authors of <u>The 
      Federalist</u>).&nbsp; By resisting the doctrine of natural human goodness and 
      other utopian revolutionary notions, by basing liberty, as Peter Viereck 
      has stated, &quot;on the Burkean principle of concrete roots, prescriptive 
      right and judicial precedent&quot;, (<u>Conservatism</u>, 1956), by arguing for 
      a representative republic rather than a direct democracy, the founding 
      fathers sewed a conservative thread inextricably into the fabric of the 
      American experience.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thread may be followed through the 
      careers and writings of many men, including John Quincy Adams, Herman 
      Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Graham Sumner, Henry Adams, George 
      Santayana, Irving Babbitt, Paul Elmer More, T.S. Eliot.&nbsp; In recent years 
      writers like Robert Penn Warren, scholars like Peter Viereck, Daniel 
      Boorstin and Clinton Rossiter, theologians like Will Herberg have given 
      intellectual expression to the conservative thread.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important, we think, that our 
      college preserve a conservative attitude because of the 
      counter-conservative posture of many independent colleges of similar size 
      and quality.&nbsp; We think that a conservative approach has contributed 
      significantly to the success of our free society and has much still to 
      give.&nbsp; We do not deny that our technology predisposes us as a society to 
      constant and rapid change; nor that modern methods of inquiry--in 
      psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, economics--allow 
      us to measure the effects of change with greater speed and assurance than 
      did an Edmund Burke, who could not have foreseen our technological 
      dynamism or the reliability of the social sciences.&nbsp; None of this, 
      however, persuades us to abandon a healthy distrust of pat theories for 
      change or emotional calls to new revolutionary vistas.&nbsp; We remain 
      convinced that it will serve America well for the students of at least one 
      small independent college of quality to be educated in a pervasively 
      conservative atmosphere.&nbsp; For our college to go along with the liberal 
      tendency found on most similar campusees would be to cut itself off from 
      its own best traditions and to abdicate a role in higher education that 
      deserves to be played.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We accept the likelihood that such a 
      posture will turn many students and their parents away from us.&nbsp; This is a 
      day when the permissiveness underlying much of home and school life makes 
      a conservative atmosphere unappealing to many well-intentioned people.&nbsp; 
      But we are convinced as well that many students and parents will seek us 
      out <u>because</u> of our conservative atmosphere--that as most campuses 
      drift further and further away from a system of customary sanctions, a 
      great many families will be happy to find a small college where the 
      contrary is true.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We thus see for the college a 
      distinctive and unusual position.&nbsp; We see it cultivating academic quality 
      second to none--and that means cautious trial and error in new techniques 
      as well as a holding to the informal, personal approach that traditionally 
      has characterized education here.&nbsp; We see it exposing students to 
      institutional policies and practices that embody the best of the 
      conservative strain in the American experience.&nbsp; We do not see it as a 
      quiet, dull place: conservatism is not opposed to the controversy that new 
      ideas and young people, mixed together, inevitably generate.&nbsp; But we do 
      see it as a reasonably decorous place, where basic good manners are valued 
      because they tend to be civilizing (we hold civility to be one of the 
      hardest and highest-valued goals).&nbsp; We do not see it as an irrelevant 
      haven for the sons&nbsp; and daughters of people who cannot accept the 
      complexities of contemporary life; we see it as a full partner, along with 
      institutions of a liberal persuasion, in showing young people how to 
      approach those complexities, we from a conservative posture, they from a 
      liberal.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally we see the college as the 
      object of interest of a group of public-spirited, thoughtful men of 
      affairs who believe that the conservative temper must survive if the 
      nation whose fruits we all enjoy is to survive whole.&nbsp; It is our hope that 
      you will wish to be one of them.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The letter was drafted for the 
      signature of the chairman of the board.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&quot;You were serious,&quot; Margaret said 
      when she finished reading the letter next time they met.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was seriously trying to survive in my 
      job,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;I knew too little to understand the philosophy of 
      education in America.&nbsp; I knew too much to believe that what I saw going on 
      was all that there could or should be.&nbsp; I knew I was in cahoots with men 
      whose bent of mind was different from mine.&nbsp; I did not think they could 
      articulate satisfactorily what they thought in their bones and expressed 
      in their daily behavior.&nbsp; I knew we were on a collision course as a team 
      if I did not figure out how to live with what they felt to be right and 
      fit.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It took me four years on the job to 
      figure out that a college is not a value-free medium for inquiry into 
      truth, that it is an institution in a specific society with the values of 
      that society.&nbsp; By the time I found Burke, I even had reached the 
      conclusion that there was no such thing as value-free inquiry.&nbsp; This was a 
      recent surprise discovery in my journal of November 1969.&nbsp; The entry had 
      an outright postmodern ring to it, although I had not heard the word at 
      that time.&nbsp; Listen:<i> I have just this moment taken a quantum leap in my 
      understanding of what the liberal arts college is and is not.&nbsp; The Phi 
      Beta Kappa viewpoint is not <u>free.</u>&nbsp; It is culture-bound and 
      culture-blind to itself.&nbsp; The notion that the mind is a disinterested 
      instrument, that it is uncommitted to anything but the spirit of free 
      inquiry--that notion is dogma, mouthed for years by the colleges and the 
      professors.&nbsp; It is rhetoric which sustains enthusiasm and obscures the 
      facts.&nbsp; The fact is that the institution<u> is</u> committed and that 
      individuals <u>are</u> committed--that the mind is our chief instrument 
      for survival.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Is it any wonder that I was ripe for 
      Nietzsche, even though nearly thirty more years had to elapse before he 
      entered my field of vision.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret looked at Bodger the way an 
      archaeologist might look at a newly uncovered fragment.&nbsp; But Bodger could 
      see that she also had some feeling for the effort he had had to make.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You either had to think your way out of 
      the dilemma or drink your way out,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;It was healthier your 
      way.&nbsp; I detect that you were not only trying to live with what they felt 
      to be right.&nbsp; You were also trying to sell them something they might not 
      believe.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger agreed.&nbsp; &quot;The letter to a 
      prospective board member and the re-draft of the black student 
      constitution had similar functions.&nbsp; Both were self-serving, to begin 
      with.&nbsp; I was trying to put the situation into words that I could live with 
      and that others could live with.&nbsp; That meant that my words were trying to 
      win affirmation from people who had not previously affirmed all of the 
      words--both DLH and Byron.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Did they win it?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When DLH read the draft, he was 
      pleased,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;His big speech at the Franklin Institute was 
      coming up in less than three weeks.&nbsp; Suddenly he had something to hold on 
      to. He trusted that I was not hoodwinking him.&nbsp; It was a blatant polemic, 
      of course.&nbsp; I knew it would anger many faculty.&nbsp; But it identified a 
      common ground, and DLH could stand on it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Could you?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; It cast the issue in simplistic terms 
      of classical rationalism vs. tradition.&nbsp; It left out of the discussion 
      much of the substance of generational conflict and new social ideology 
      then disrupting the campuses of the nation, including ours.&nbsp; The logic of 
      it suited me, though.&nbsp; I enjoyed the blush of discovering Burke through 
      Rossiter and Kirk--late, again, though I was.&nbsp; However, DLH rushed too 
      fast for my comfort to believe I believed it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On a cold evening early in January, we 
      met in the board room with William Elliott, one of the biggest financial 
      players on our board.&nbsp; We had the opportunity to borrow several millions 
      from the federal government to build the new gymnasium, which would come 
      to be named Helfferich Hall, with the pool named for Elliott.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;DL had stood firm against taking 
      government support for the college as a matter of conservative principle.&nbsp; 
      If the college got into bed with the government, sooner or later the 
      government would tell us what we had to do.&nbsp; If we did not take the money, 
      the capstone project of the Helfferich administration would probably be 
      postponed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Elliott took a small life insurance 
      company from obscurity to success.&nbsp; His financial judgment was sharp.&nbsp; He 
      had a sense of the flow of the social and political process.&nbsp; He also was 
      a super salesman.&nbsp; He had pledged a quarter of a million dollars or so to 
      our campaign, so his voice had clout.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;DLH put it to Elliott.&nbsp; Should we borrow 
      the money or not?&nbsp; Knowing how eager DLH was to go forward, Elliott 
      meandered his way to a rationalization for borrowing the money that DLH 
      could buy.&nbsp; Elliott talked about the trend toward public involvement in 
      the welfare of the nation, reaching back to the WPA and coming forward 
      through the GI Bill and federal capital support of higher education.&nbsp; 
      'It's contrary to everything I was brought up to believe, but I'm not so 
      sure it's all bad.&nbsp; It's different,' Elliott said.&nbsp; He was confident that 
      at some time in the years ahead the government would forgive indebtedness 
      of the sort we were contemplating, sooner than reclaim the property.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When the issues were really serious, DLH 
      enjoyed puffing on a pipe.&nbsp; He puffed as Elliott delivered himself of this 
      opinion, a wry smile curling around the stem, his eyes widening and their 
      corners crinkling just noticeably.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So much for laissez-faire conservatism,&quot; 
      Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Precisely.&nbsp; I can't tell you how much 
      that meeting eased my mind over my own difficulties with conservatism.&nbsp; I 
      saw to my relief that conservative truth&nbsp; no longer seemed so 
      impregnable.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The college borrowed the money, surely,&quot; 
      Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Of course--behold the gym today, still 
      being paid for at three percent interest, which we pay with a grant of 
      other federal dollars.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Later, after Elliott left, Helfferich 
      and I stayed on to chat a little.&nbsp; Still puffing his pipe, he mentioned 
      the 'draft to a prospective board member.'&nbsp; He remained pleased with it 
      and seemed to see it as evidence of a personal conversion.&nbsp; He asked: 'How 
      far away were you from believing what you wrote when you came here five 
      years ago?'</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This was disconcerting to me.&nbsp; I wanted 
      to tell him, 'Wait, I wrote that to put into sentences what I <i>think</i> 
      you have been getting at.&nbsp; It's a field test, a model to think about.<i>
      </i>&nbsp;I need to work out what is there that I can affirm and what I 
      can't.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You didn't say it,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I said, 'About 25,000 miles.'&nbsp; That 
      confirmed a thesis he often talked to me about.&nbsp; He had seen many young 
      faculty members come to campus with liberal fire in their eyes, only to 
      dampen down into reasonable conservatives.&nbsp; He attributed it to the 
      atmosphere of the place, which, of course, he felt he had a major hand in 
      creating and sustaining.&nbsp; I simply did not have it in me to differ with 
      him at the time.&nbsp; I felt as if my draft had won something important.&nbsp; 
      Clearly it deepened his feeling that I should continue to prepare for the 
      presidency sometime.&nbsp; But I knew that the common ground staked out by the 
      draft was something of an intellectual illusion.&nbsp; It would fool the true 
      believers for a while, and it would certainly get the goats of many of my 
      faculty friends.&nbsp; I would have to own up to my friends on the faculty that 
      I wrote much of DLH's big speech.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How did the speech go over?&quot; asked 
      Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; We incorporated great chunks of the 
      draft into his text.&nbsp; The moment was electric--apologies for a Ben 
      Franklin pun.&nbsp; DLH was at his theatrical best. When he spoke, standing 
      under the feet of Franklin's huge statue, I heard my own words with an 
      eerie feeling--a mixture of distance and intimacy.&nbsp; The true believers 
      loved it.&nbsp; Many faculty couldn't believe what they were hearing.&nbsp; I think 
      most wrote it off as sheer entertainment, bravura.&nbsp; But I think to this 
      day that it was a milestone in my path to becoming president.&nbsp; It gave DLH, 
      and those over whom he had influence, a belief that I was thinking the 
      right things and could express them.&nbsp; The text was reprinted in a 
      pamphlet.&nbsp; A faculty member took DLH to task in a letter to the student 
      paper for his pessimistic assumptions about human nature.&nbsp; That was about 
      it.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later at home, before retiring for the 
      night, Bodger almost visibly blushed when he leafed through the pamphlet 
      containing the speech.&nbsp; He had not looked at it in a quarter of a 
      century.&nbsp; It had mercifully disappeared quickly from public view.&nbsp; It 
      seemed that none of his friends ever figured out how responsible he was 
      for those words.&nbsp; If they had, he hoped that they would have excused him 
      as a subordinate to DLH who had no choice but to smith a speech.&nbsp; They 
      would not have believed that he held such convictions.&nbsp; They would have 
      known that he was elsewhere on the spectrum, at a distance from those who 
      paid obeisance to the tried and true.&nbsp;&nbsp; They had seen his enthusiasm for 
      transformative creativity expressed by Suzanne Langer in <i>Philosophy In 
      a New Key.</i>&nbsp; They had witnessed his affirmation of the abstract 
      expressionist art then in the ascendant in America.&nbsp; They had heard him 
      talk about his own wish to break through the forms of the day, to create 
      something truly new.&nbsp; They had come to think his allegiance to something 
      he called &quot;the creative advance&quot; set him apart from his fellow 
      administrators.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger could not have pretended to master 
      the philosophy of process and reality in the heavy pages of Alfred North 
      Whitehead; but he could have emulated--and he had-- Whitehead's buoyant, 
      optimistic attitude toward novelty.&nbsp; In doing so, he had set up an 
      unresolved tension in himself: the polemical formulations grounded in 
      Burke simply would not sustain the way he found himself thinking when he 
      confronted an administrative problem.&nbsp; Burke would have had him try to 
      stop the flow; Bodger, in keeping with Whitehead, wanted to gauge its 
      direction and ride it toward something better, a new formulation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought, as he turned out the light: &quot;DLH 
      could not have been so credulous.&nbsp; Surely it didn't matter to him whether 
      or not I <i>thought</i> I was a conservative.&nbsp; He saw me cooperating with 
      him and helping him--that was enough for him.&nbsp; Enough for me too, at the 
      time.&nbsp; I was not in the business of political philosophy but of 
      surviving.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger was thankful in the darkness.&nbsp; He 
      would never have to make such a confession to anyone but himself. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>Bodger's relations with faculty were 
      complicated </u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret was upset about the annual 
      evaluation handed in to the dean by her department head.&nbsp; She sought 
      Bodger's advice after dinner one evening at his home.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Gone fishin',&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;Advising days 
      are over, especially on faculty relations.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm going to write a complaint to the 
      dean and president,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's your right,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;Faculty 
      culture on an undergraduate campus is deeply communal.&nbsp; At the same time, 
      everyone leads a very separate professional life.&nbsp; The people who know you 
      best don't know you.&nbsp; Often they don't know your work either.&nbsp; Much of it 
      is invisible and resistant to measure.&nbsp; When your status is at stake, you 
      have to do what you have to do.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I appreciate your encouragement,&quot; she 
      said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Just don't call it advice,&quot; Bodger 
      replied.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They turned to Bodger's experiences with 
      faculty.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;From what you've said,&quot; Margaret mused, 
      &quot;I take it that your relations with faculty were complicated but good 
      before you were president.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger reflected: &quot;If the old term 'alma 
      mater' ever meant anything other than sentimental attachments to an 
      institution, it meant something central to me.&nbsp; When I returned to the 
      campus to work in 1965, I found myself becoming a colleague of a dozen or 
      so people who had taught me in class, not to mention a number almost equal 
      who knew me but whose courses I had not taken.&nbsp; Most of them were alumni, 
      like me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an experience I never expected to have and even today 
      wonder at.&nbsp; I felt as if I was moving back into an arena where those 
      professors had created the molds for the way I would think and feel.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
      was one of hundreds, thousands, they had taught.&nbsp; Yet I possessed 
      them--and was possessed by them--in a way that seemed to me unique.&nbsp; This 
      feeling of possession of course exceeded the bounds of what really took 
      place when I was a student.&nbsp;&nbsp; At a time when I had doubted my ability to 
      become much of anything, their affirmation of my class work astounded me.&nbsp; 
      I never forgot it and surely magnified it over time.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;By the time I was a senior at the 
      college, I have a hunch their affirmation had led me to believe I had 
      greater intellectual power than I had.&nbsp; I did not understand that their 
      knowledge and their judgment were limited too.&nbsp; It did not matter.&nbsp; The 
      confidence they gave me in my power to move ideas around surely enabled me 
      to get on with my life after graduation.&nbsp; They knew, certainly, that I 
      would discover my limits without any need of help from them.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I could never feel on a par with them 
      after I came back to the college because of the special role they played 
      in my youthful development.&nbsp; It did not take long for me to find that they 
      were fallible human beings like everybody else.&nbsp; But that never changed my 
      absolute sense of gratitude and appreciation for what they did to me at a 
      tender age.&nbsp; I hope some of them, at least, felt that.&nbsp; As I moved into 
      administrative work, often saying and doing things that they would find 
      objectionable as faculty members, I always felt they would grant me a 
      pardon.&nbsp; In a parental and filial sense, perhaps we knew that we would be 
      for each other and not against each other, however hot the policy issue 
      became.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I feel sad to count the number of 
      funerals where I have stood to speak well of them.&nbsp; I'm glad, though, that 
      I have lived to be able to do it.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;'Alma mater' suggests 
      rah-rah stuff and boys being boys and girls girls, all the rite of passage 
      baggage.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I hardly experienced any of that.&nbsp; I was 
      a local kid, commuting to campus.&nbsp; I even dodged the hazing routine as a 
      new student, imposed by the sophomores.&nbsp; Pretended to be a veteran, who 
      were numerous in 1949, although I looked like a mere boy.&nbsp; Vets were 
      exempt from soph rules.&nbsp; The college for me was the teachers I had and the 
      latitude to think about doing something with my life.&nbsp; They were the bed 
      of rock on which I constructed the rest of my thinking life.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;As pedagogical styles and expectations 
      changed in the years after I became president, these big figures in my 
      youth sometimes came in for criticism by young Turks.&nbsp; Few did any notable 
      publication after they finished their graduate work.&nbsp; Few practiced any 
      classroom style other than the 'stand-and-deliver' lecture.&nbsp; Some did 
      little to refresh their notes over the years.&nbsp; In a strange way, I heard 
      this and could even agree with it, but that did not alter the 
      larger-than-life perception of them that I had formed and that remained in 
      my thinking about them throughout. We developed a set of criteria for 
      evaluation of teaching during my presidency.&nbsp; By then most of the cohort 
      were retired or senior enough to treat the process with ironic good humor.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;To this day I celebrate them all.&nbsp; They 
      reminded me that teaching is a mysterious process.&nbsp; Most of them became 
      legendary when alumni gathered.&nbsp; Even their weaknesses became the stuff of 
      story and acquired, through time, a special meaning.&nbsp; From the start of my 
      employment, I was responsible for cultivating the interest of alumni in 
      the college.&nbsp; I naturally trafficked in the experiences I shared with so 
      many of them as students under these professors.&nbsp; It was one of the 
      resources that came to me without my having to earn it.&nbsp; By bringing 
      current news to alumni out in the field about the professors they and I 
      had sat under years before, I created a common bond.&nbsp; Many of the senior 
      faculty were themselves alumni.&nbsp; So the circle of loyalty was tight.&nbsp; I 
      sometimes felt that promoting alumni interest was too easy as a job.&nbsp; The 
      common connection all of us had with the campus made it all very natural.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;It was all very 
      provincial too.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger acknowledged this and then moved 
      on to talk about other faculty members.&nbsp; &quot;Beyond the group of my former 
      teachers, I gravitated early to the young faculty.&nbsp; We had a feisty 
      bunch.&nbsp; There was generational magnetism.&nbsp; The young faculty always tend 
      to hang together socially as well as professionally.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Antoine,&quot; Margaret said by way of 
      agreement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's one of the difficulties of aging, 
      I found.&nbsp; I only discovered it a lifetime later.&nbsp; When young, you take for 
      granted that you can connect with your peers.&nbsp; When you become a senior 
      player, you cannot take connection so easily for granted.&nbsp; Sometimes in my 
      last years I found that even great effort to communicate became suspect.&nbsp; 
      The young people did not want connection from my end, or could not seem to 
      handle it at face value.&nbsp; I became more brittle too.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm an exception?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm out of power now--that makes it 
      easier for you and me to talk.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What were the young faculty like then?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Wonderful, as I look back on them. &nbsp;I 
      arrived on campus thirsting for intellectual stimulation after years of 
      drinking the watery goop of corporate management philosophy.&nbsp; In English, 
      Mike Foster was fresh out of the Harvard MA in teaching program.&nbsp; He was 
      on his way to discovering linguistic anthropology.&nbsp; He dragged me--and 
      others--along in his wake, full of excitement about the interrelations of 
      language and culture.&nbsp; In Wes Clymer, I felt a kinship based on a kind of 
      purist belief in the power of literary art.&nbsp; He was the mad monkish 
      scholar I imagined I might have been if I had not become an operator.&nbsp; His 
      insight into the darker marks in Joseph Conrad seemed to come out of a 
      cauldron deep in himself.&nbsp; Mel Ehrlich had theatre and journalism in his 
      background and brought a swinging sophistication to the old gray hall.&nbsp; 
      Gary Waldo was in history, a specialist in Mussolini.&nbsp; I did not teach 
      with him, but we shared an enthusiasm for engaging the students in 
      debate.&nbsp; I once taught in Bomberger in a room next to his, divided by a 
      wall that could open up.&nbsp; His voice boomed through the wall as if he were 
      Mussolini himself.&nbsp; A young mathematician, Dick Call, tried to teach us 
      about symbolic logic.&nbsp; There were some mainstays of the faculty who 
      because of temperament connected with the new guys, a psychologist, a 
      political scientist, another English comp teacher.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;We never were a definable group, 
      although for a time some of us met at someone's home.&nbsp; In my journal I 
      dubbed it 'the &quot;new&quot; Vienna School on the Perkiomen.'&nbsp; We did not meet 
      often and soon we stopped.&nbsp; Our logician spoke in a language from which 
      the rest of us were excluded.&nbsp; We poked at the nature of the external 
      world, at the relation of logical thought to the reality of reality.&nbsp; My 
      insights on Zen did not get through.&nbsp; Today we would start a chat group on 
      the Internet and have a better chance of surviving.&nbsp; Everybody was busy, 
      and this was outside of our course obligations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In English comp, Foster, Ehrlich, and I 
      collaborated on a freshman project centered on the nature of language. &nbsp;It 
      served Foster's emerging graduate school interests more than it served our 
      students, I'm afraid. Mike went on for his doctorate at Penn and ended up 
      in the Canadian museum system, an Iroquois specialist.&nbsp; But it was 
      exciting for me to be up to my ears in new ideas. I had inadequate 
      credentials even to be on the faculty.&nbsp; I felt as if I had not read 
      enough--of course, I hadn't.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You had a stimulating process going,&quot; 
      Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A couple of years after I arrived, the 
      academic council was restructured.&nbsp; It provided for the addition of a 
      representative from the rank of instructor.&nbsp; When it came time for 
      election in the faculty meeting, I was nominated unopposed.&nbsp; The thought 
      among my colleagues probably was that I could pull more weight, since I 
      was then assistant to the president.&nbsp; Still, such a conflation of roles 
      seems unique in retrospect.&nbsp; Faculty trust of an administrator does not 
      normally come that easily, especially one so poorly equipped with academic 
      credentials and experience.&nbsp; It is hard to go back to that time, through 
      all the impressions of faculty suspicion and criticism piled up through my 
      years as president.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It looks pretty evident to me,&quot; Margaret 
      said.&nbsp; &quot;You had two big blocs of natural support--your former teachers and 
      your current young friends.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In my corporate experience, I developed 
      a compulsive need for ordering my ideas and actions.&nbsp; This led to lists 
      and check-offs.&nbsp; Editing a magazine, for one thing, made me compulsively 
      aware of tasks to be done by a date certain.&nbsp; I brought this habit to the 
      campus.&nbsp; I always had to write an agenda.&nbsp; It always had to be 
      comprehensive.&nbsp; I kept notes after most meetings.&nbsp; I wrote in my journal 
      about issues afterward.&nbsp; When I got onto the council, this compulsive bent 
      came into play.&nbsp; By that time, 1967, I had had a full exposure to all the 
      curricular gossip.&nbsp; It was new to me, and I loved the novelty of it.&nbsp; I 
      had been used to a corporate product as a tangible thing, made in 
      catalytic cracking machines, transmitted through pipes.&nbsp; Here, to my 
      delight, I found the product was the stuff of mind, to be shaped and 
      packaged according to wonderfully debatable principles of organization.&nbsp; 
      It was sheer luxury.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When the faculty elected me to academic 
      council, I pulled in all the ideas for curriculum change that I had heard 
      and made them into an agenda, which I circulated among my young faculty 
      friends.&nbsp; This was unique.&nbsp; Nobody had done it before.&nbsp; Here was a lowly 
      instructor, teaching only part-time, with no legitimate credentials, new 
      to the campus, mobilizing a platform for improvement.&nbsp; The effrontery of 
      it!&nbsp; DLH read it with an amused smile.&nbsp; If half the items were pursued, he 
      would have a headache.&nbsp; However, he said nothing critical.&nbsp; He seemed to 
      look on my list as another step in my basic training--both the content of 
      the curricular ideas and the process I would have to go through in dealing 
      with the dean and other council members.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Was your agenda all that radical?&quot; asked 
      Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was a pastiche.&nbsp; By this time, I 
      think I had read Daniel Bell's book on reforming the Columbia curriculum.&nbsp; 
      So I was not altogether devoid of a theoretical understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was 
      Bell who more than others advanced the notion that we should teach the 
      method of a discipline and not just the subject of a discipline.&nbsp; That is 
      now conventional wisdom.&nbsp; Thirty years ago it was not, at the 
      undergraduate level, anyway.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Urged by DLH, the faculty had gone 
      through an extensive study of curriculum and had passed a new plan.&nbsp; Parts 
      of the plan were unimplemented.&nbsp; It was easy for me to call for 
      implementation of what had already been decided.&nbsp; Fine arts was an item, 
      for example.&nbsp; The typical liberal arts curriculum in the '60s was heavily 
      skewed toward the cognitive and away from the creative, a classic liberal 
      arts position, completely defensible.&nbsp; The faculty decided we needed 
      something in art but had not specified what.&nbsp; I'm not even sure why it 
      thought we needed it.&nbsp; There was probably a fuzzy notion of 'rounding' the 
      offerings.&nbsp; Then too, colleges we aspired to equal had such things and 
      they thus were a code for a certain kind of perceived quality.&nbsp; With my 
      friends, I urged the formation of a Fine Arts Committee and the 
      development of guidelines for courses in art theory and the formal 
      problems of art as well as in studio work.&nbsp; Studio courses did become an 
      offering.&nbsp; An 'appreciation' approach to art history remained in place, 
      however, to the exclusion of more esoteric studies of art theory.&nbsp; Art 
      theory happened to be a hobby-horse of mine without much meaning for the 
      curriculum then in place.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;You were the prime mover 
      years later for creating the Berman Museum in the old library.&quot;&nbsp; New 
      though she was, she was coming to own the institutional memory.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, I brought my biases to bear in 
      this, then and later.&nbsp; Nobody ever told me that leadership required the 
      person to abandon all his special interests.&nbsp; The important thing is to 
      match the special interests of the person with the needs of an institution 
      at a particular time.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;Fine arts was one thing.&nbsp; 
      Did your manifesto call for other innovations?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'Manifesto'--good,&quot; Bodger laughed.&nbsp; 
      &quot;You have to realize that the college in the mid-'60s was still living 
      with the ghosts of penury.&nbsp; The Depression had almost put it under in the 
      '30s.&nbsp; Led by DLH, it had painstakingly reestablished financial 
      stability.&nbsp; It had done so by depriving itself of extras.&nbsp; That was true 
      of the physical plant as well as the program.&nbsp; So, many colleges like it 
      in mission and scope had a richness in curricular offerings unavailable 
      here.&nbsp; Filling in gaps was thus one simple need.&nbsp; That's not to say that 
      DLH or the dean or many of the faculty necessarily saw them as gaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
      didn't offer some things, they would say, as a matter of principle.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Such as?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our offerings in the social sciences.&nbsp; 
      The college had a reputation as a hard and good place for science.&nbsp; 
      'Science' meant chemistry, biology, physics, with mathematics.&nbsp; This 
      determined the attitude of the prevailing powers in the faculty toward the 
      other sciences.&nbsp; The others did not quite count.&nbsp; Psychology had been 
      allowed into the curriculum years before because of the pragmatic need to 
      give student teachers the requisite exposure to educational psychology.&nbsp; 
      The prevailing faculty leaders felt small need to acknowledge the rigor 
      brought to psychology through the newer work of behavioral experimenters.&nbsp; 
      At bottom, I think that Helfferich believed that psychology invaded the 
      turf of traditional wisdom surrounding human behavior--of which he felt 
      himself to be a dedicated custodian and practitioner.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a veiled 
      theological issue.&nbsp; Psychology seemed to pose a threat to the Protestant 
      ethos ingrained in the culture of the college from its start.&nbsp; By the 
      '60s, the college had moved far enough away from that start to disallow a 
      forthright airing of this conflict.&nbsp; It would have appeared even to DLH as 
      an intellectually questionable confrontation.&nbsp; But he knew his feelings; 
      he knew what he had inherited.&nbsp; Instead of taking a direct look at the 
      value of psychology in the curriculum, DLH and the dean marginalized it 
      through budgetary constraints and occasional administrative legerdemain.&nbsp; 
      Faculty meetings occasionally were enlivened by a harangue for psychology 
      from the head of that department, Dick Fletcher.&nbsp; DLH--or the dean--would 
      invariably follow it with a witty retort or an arch expression of 
      gratitude for the thought, which he would promptly dismiss.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The attitude toward psychology was 
      compounded when attention turned to anthropology and sociology.&nbsp; My 
      memorable experience with Gunnar Myrdal's analysis of the American dilemma 
      on race took place in the single one-semester course in sociology in the 
      early '50s.&nbsp; It was paralleled by a one-semester course in anthropology.&nbsp; 
      That thin diet had not changed in the fifteen years or so that followed.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What did you call for?&quot; asked Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I didn't know enough to call for 
      anything other than the reforms already written into the new Curricular 
      Plan and still unimplemented.&nbsp; Hardly points of a manifesto.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Such as?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Nothing new was promised for psychology 
      itself.&nbsp; In the '60s, the urge to integrate disciplines came alive.&nbsp; The 
      Plan called for an integrated science course for non-science majors and an 
      integrated social science course.&nbsp; I urged implementation forthwith.&nbsp; The 
      faculty set these goals with good intentions, I imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the urge to 
      pursue them was weak, as I saw it.&nbsp; Money was alleged to be unavailable.&nbsp; 
      The only contribution I could make was to suggest that the integrated 
      courses pay attention to the social effects of science.&nbsp; I cited the work 
      on that being done at Columbia's Institute for the Study of Science in 
      Human Affairs.&nbsp; Perhaps I had been reading Gerald Holton--can't recall.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'Integration' has a period sound today,&quot; 
      Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was a banner in the '60s for change.&nbsp; 
      Like 'relevance.'&nbsp; Like many others, I thought things should be integrated 
      and relevant.&nbsp; Did I know what I was talking about?&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; Did I 
      realize that these were political and social banners waving--that the push 
      to restructure the curriculum as a pure academic concern was far less 
      strident?&nbsp; Not until much later.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Was that all there was to the social 
      science agenda?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Anthropology was targeted in the Plan 
      but not yet implemented.&nbsp; I urged action.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">Bodger read from the old 
      paper he had written:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">&nbsp;<i>I recommend a 
      two-semester (six hour) introductory course.&nbsp; Beyond that, we might offer 
      two or three courses in a special field of cultural anthropology, such as 
      South American or African.&nbsp; The area should be accessible enough to permit 
      field work in summer.&nbsp; Urge the administration to hire a person who is 
      qualified to teach the introductory course and specialized in the field we 
      wish to emphasize.&nbsp; The college should set up a cooperative program with 
      two or three neighboring colleges, which would offer courses in other 
      specialties (perhaps archaeology or physical anthropology or some other 
      area of cultural anthropology).&nbsp; Our students and theirs would receive 
      full credit for courses taken at the cooperating colleges</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Where did you get these ideas?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The young faculty talked a lot.&nbsp; There 
      was a spirit in the air.&nbsp; We were looking outward, looking for 
      connections, embracing the world beyond our little campus.&nbsp; The college to 
      the young faculty seemed quite parochial.&nbsp; I had a denser experience of it 
      because of my student background, and I was older than most of them.&nbsp; But 
      I went with their drift.&nbsp; The college <i>was not</i> in the vanguard of 
      academic change.&nbsp; It <i>was</i> deficient in offerings, in perspective.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That was my impression when I arrived,&quot; 
      Margaret said.&nbsp; &quot;Still.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Of course,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;It's a given 
      in any new faculty member just out of a creditable graduate school 
      experience.&nbsp; An undergraduate-only environment will not have the velocity 
      of thought found in a decent graduate school environment.&nbsp; But what seems 
      to you to be parochial today was not even on the horizon in the '60s.&nbsp; The 
      Plan called for courses in comparative world cultures, world literature, 
      exemption from English composition.&nbsp; My 'manifesto' said, 'Implement.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Some of the curriculum plans did come 
      into being, then?&quot; asked Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sooner or later.&nbsp; But here, look at my 
      agenda.&nbsp; I took the whole college for my province, not just the 
      curriculum.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret looked through the yellowing 
      memo.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The faculty should make 
      recommendations to the administration of individuals who would enrich our 
      general educational program by brief periods of residence on campus.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;Many years later, in 
      foreign languages, we brought in native-speaking graduate students to live 
      in the halls.&nbsp; Some of these ideas had a long life and, of course, they 
      were not mine for the most part.&nbsp; I cribbed anything that sounded 
      exciting.&nbsp; I look shameless in my zeal to push ahead.&nbsp; What a pain in the 
      butt I must have been to some of the people.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Research: The faculty should study, 
      through a special committee, the place of research at the college and make 
      its views known to the administration in the form of a resolution.&nbsp; Urge 
      that a separate Faculty Scholars Fund be established, the proceeds of 
      which would pay for certain costs of research.&nbsp; Decisions for use of such 
      proceeds might be made on recommendation of a Faculty Committee which 
      would review research projects proposed by colleagues.</i> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You mean there was no such thing?&quot; 
      Margaret asked incredulously.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger replied, &quot;You take for granted our 
      faculty development program today. In 1967, my little statement was 
      tantamount to heresy.&nbsp; The college did not expect faculty members to do 
      research.&nbsp; If they did, they pursued it on their own time, in the middle 
      of the night, as Helfferich once pridefully told a group of alumni.&nbsp; The 
      fruits of that labor, he implied, were sweeter because they came from deep 
      within the soul of the professor, not from a mere term of employment.&nbsp; It 
      was not until after I was president for some years that anything like this 
      idea came into being.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret read on:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>Size of classes: Some courses are heavily 
      populated.&nbsp; The faculty should call for a study of those courses to see 
      whether the large enrollments are doing violence to the quality of 
      instruction.&nbsp; If this seems to be the case, appropriate recommendations 
      should be made to the administration.&nbsp; A related subject for consideration 
      is the place of closed-circuit TV and computerized courses.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Tight-budget syndrome,&quot; Bodger 
      said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret pointed at the paper and said, 
      &quot;Here's one that surely set the dean to gritting his teeth.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>Divisional Organization: One of the reasons for 
      our failure to implement some of the Curricular Plan proposals is the lack 
      of inter-disciplinary structures.&nbsp; The supremacy of the Departments was 
      strongly asserted when the Plan was approved.&nbsp; Much might be gained by 
      modifying that position.&nbsp; Without destroying the departments, we might set 
      up four divisional councils which would have a more inclusive and coherent 
      perspective on the curriculum.&nbsp; For example, if we had had a divisional 
      council concerned about the social sciences as a whole, the need for an 
      anthropology program may well have come to the surface much sooner.&nbsp; Also, 
      divisional councils would be well suited to devise the integrated science 
      and social science courses called for in the Plan.&nbsp; Some fear that 
      divisional units would create &quot;super-departments&quot; and cause &quot;political&quot; 
      problems.&nbsp; This may be a lesser problem than the one now prevailing--the 
      &quot;splendid isolation&quot; of 14 different departments.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;Divisional consciousness 
      developed in my presidential years, as you can see today, but nothing this 
      formal ever came into being.&nbsp; More than other items, this one came out of 
      my own observation.&nbsp; My previous corporate experience came into play as I 
      thought about the organization of the faculty.&nbsp; Some faculty gave lip 
      service to the idea of integration.&nbsp; Yet their comfort with their 
      stand-alone departmental structure contradicted their declarations of 
      faith.&nbsp; Partly that came from the sheer inertia found in every social 
      organization.&nbsp; Partly it came from the boundaries they had constructed 
      around their professional disciplines in graduate school.&nbsp; A liberal arts 
      college foists upon the collective faculty a breadth of responsibility for 
      the whole of liberal learning that the average faculty member individually 
      is poorly trained to bear.&nbsp; I came to this conviction soon after sitting 
      through the prickly debates that then erupted in monthly meetings of the 
      faculty.&nbsp; President Helfferich, as chair, sometimes allowed the troops to 
      shoot each other down.&nbsp; When they were shooting at each other, they were 
      not shooting at the administration--a lesson I carefully kept for future 
      reference.&nbsp; Of course, I did not understand the unwritten codes and the 
      esoteric history of relationships on the faculty.&nbsp; I'm confident that I 
      misread much of what I was seeing and hearing in those early years.&nbsp; 
      Nevertheless, 'integration' and the construction of divisional common 
      ground were not burning priorities.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret rippled to the last page.&nbsp; &quot;Here 
      you talked more about divisions and interdisciplinary studies.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>One of the problems of institutionalized learning 
      is that the methodological assumptions of a discipline (and its individual 
      courses) tend to become submerged.&nbsp; With the changes and additions being 
      made in most fields of study, we should try to make our students more 
      conscious of the strategies of inquiry with interdisciplinary courses 
      which take a subject matter and approach it from several angles within one 
      of the disciplines--humanities, science, social science, language (see the 
      program at Amherst College.)</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;If that wasn't 
      straight from Daniel Bell, I would be surprised.&nbsp; Here in the nineties, we 
      are used to the discussion of building the canon of a discipline.&nbsp; We are 
      all veterans of the 'culture wars' precipitated by multiculturalism.&nbsp; The 
      underlying structure of the disciplines in my early years, at least at a 
      place like ours, was rather like Victorian sex.&nbsp; We knew it was there but 
      there wasn't much talk about it.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger turned to the window. &quot;But most of 
      these pronouncements grew out of my naive enthusiasm.&nbsp; It was a grand time 
      to be romping around in the field of academe, new to me, and inhabited by 
      interesting people who were too considerate to shoot me down, at least in 
      public.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret was not finished with his 
      'manifesto.'</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>Student-Faculty-Administration Committee: The 
      faculty should seek to elevate the newly constituted joint committee above 
      the level of petty griping by submitting an agenda for discussion.&nbsp; Items 
      on the agenda should be curricular as well as extra-curricular.&nbsp; We should 
      take the initiative in seeking student involvement in academic questions.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger responded, &quot;This was not out of 
      step with DLH's thinking or that of most faculty.&nbsp; If we have one deep 
      channel of practice at this place, in spite of the paternalistic history, 
      it is a predisposition to put students to the test of engagement with us.&nbsp; 
      The difference between my intent here and DLH's, say, would have been that 
      I thought something substantive should normally grow out of student 
      engagement with us.&nbsp; New programs should result.&nbsp; DLH, on the other hand, 
      would have thought that talking a lot and following through on a little 
      was more appropriate.&nbsp; Back to Burke--be not hasty to make a change.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But that's dishonest,&quot; Margaret said.&nbsp; 
      &quot;You shouldn't go into a process without intending to get out of it what 
      you said should come out of it.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I suppose I thought so then,&quot; Bodger 
      replied.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And not later?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The fray over time changes you.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret decided not to push the question 
      further and continued reading:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ten-year planning: The Academic 
      Council should set a deadline of, say, November 30, 1967, for completion 
      of all 10-year departmental plans.&nbsp; Subsequently, the Curriculum Committee 
      should be charged with the responsibility to digest, coordinate and 
      supplement these plans, so that a unified program emerges.&nbsp; Attention 
      should be given to eliminating courses as well as introducing new ones.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret asked, &quot;Wasn't this something 
      you already had under way?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Memory fails me,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; 
      &quot;Planning, in any event, became my mantra, and this is an early sign of 
      it.&nbsp; DLH had been talking to me about the planning process.&nbsp; He put me in 
      charge of planning rather early in the game.&nbsp; In one sense, you could say 
      that my entire experience at the college parses into planning stages.&nbsp; I 
      took to it because it allowed me to embrace the entire place, to think 
      globally about it, to ignore the brambles and briar patches that snagged 
      your trousers as you walked between departments.&nbsp; I think 10-year 
      curricular planning may have been a diversionary tactic at the time, 
      however--set up by DLH and the dean to stir some thinking but not to 
      precipitate significant action.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You sound critical of them.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not really.&nbsp; They were exercising a 
      canny wisdom that sometimes is hard to codify or even to express 
      intelligibly.&nbsp; As an apprentice, I absorbed ways of feinting and dodging 
      from them, as I had absorbed lessons from my former bosses at the 
      company.&nbsp; You come to internalize these things.&nbsp; Only now, in retrospect, 
      do I see the conditioning process a little more clearly.&nbsp; Still, planning 
      was key. &nbsp;With our business manager, I worked out ten-year global planning 
      scenarios.&nbsp; They included the buildings we hoped to build, the endowments 
      we hoped to grow, the new expenditures some of us envisioned for improving 
      academic quality.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And then....&quot; Margaret waved the agenda 
      in the air.&nbsp; &quot;Finally, 'Venture Programs.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Some pie in the sky.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She read:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>The college is more inclined to conserve methods 
      that have proved successful over the years than to experiment with &quot;risky&quot; 
      innovations and untried approaches to learning.&nbsp; (The few exceptions to 
      this merely prove the rule.)</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&quot;You were hearing Burke even this early,&quot; 
      said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was anticipating the reaction of the 
      president and the dean to the fluky ideas about to be spread before them.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She continued reading:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;We should find a way to experiment rather freely 
      with new programs without placing the time-tested system in total 
      jeopardy.&nbsp; We should create a climate in which &quot;venture programs&quot; (as they 
      are called at a neighboring prestige college which shall be nameless) 
      naturally work their way into our curriculum on an experimental basis and, 
      if they don't live up to expectations, naturally work themselves out 
      again.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be argued that experimentation 
      with curriculum is dangerous because it is unwarranted tampering with a 
      given student's four-year package of courses.&nbsp; It will also be argued that 
      many experimental programs come in with great fanfare and then &quot;fizzle 
      out.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both arguments have a basis in fact.&nbsp; 
      But they overlook the importance of a spirit of adventure not only in 
      individual courses and instructors but in the institution as a whole.&nbsp; 
      There is nothing to fear from &quot;venture programs&quot; if we provide at the 
      outset for the possibility that they might fail, but still provide 
      students with a meaningful experience.&nbsp; In other words, we need not stake 
      the reputation of the college on the success or failure of a given 
      program; we may stake our reputation on our <u>disposition </u>to give a 
      program a chance to succeed or fail.&nbsp; It should contaminate students with 
      the zest for intellectual adventure.&nbsp; It will do this best if it is 
      flexible enough to permit adventure in its own program of offerings.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Whitehead's parrot,&quot; Bodger laughed.&nbsp; 
      &quot;The dean should have charged me with plagiarism.&nbsp; The unnamed college was 
      probably Swarthmore.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You proposed language houses for foreign 
      language majors.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not original,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;We never 
      did this. The department sometime after this began a healthy tradition of 
      conversation at language tables in the dining hall.&nbsp; We started an 
      international house during my presidential tenure but it was not 
      language-specific.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Here's one,&quot; Margaret said:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>Non-graded colloquia.&nbsp; Establish a course 
      required of all students, and taught by all teachers, with pass-fail 
      marking as in physical education.&nbsp; The subject matter of each course would 
      be decided upon by each of the sections individually.&nbsp; The only guideline 
      would be that the course would deal with the broad question of Personal 
      Values.&nbsp; Perhaps something of this sort would be a sensible alternative to 
      chapel-assembly.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;The pass-fail fad 
      lost its wind after the '60s.&nbsp;&nbsp; It never took root here.&nbsp; This failed idea 
      lingers as a ghost behind our present Liberal Studies seminar, which has 
      no prescribed common syllabus.&nbsp; But something else was lurking in this 
      'venture' idea, and you see it in that reference to the chapel-assembly.&nbsp; 
      Required religious chapel was dead or dying.&nbsp; DLH and others wanted to 
      hang onto something that affirmed the importance of moral and ethical 
      behavior as a college goal.&nbsp; I thought I was offering a way to end 
      compulsory chapel while holding onto a compulsory consideration of moral 
      and ethical behavior.&nbsp; But it did not fly.&nbsp; The president, the dean, and 
      most of the faculty thought poorly about non-graded work.&nbsp; It violated in 
      some way the work ethic of the Protestant culture.&nbsp; I did not do battle 
      for this item.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Here's one that's even farther out,&quot; 
      Margaret said, coming to the end of the paper: </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>Non-course, non-grade program: Set up a program 
      for 20 specially selected students who would work as a group under a 
      director employed for the purpose.&nbsp; The group would be exempt from all 
      normal requirements and would qualify for graduation by taking 
      comprehensive tests at intervals.&nbsp; Purpose of the program would be to 
      permit freedom for students with special qualifications, and to provide a 
      model of study for students in the conventional curriculum.&nbsp; Obviously, 
      after such a plan were blueprinted, foundation money would be needed to 
      implement it.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger shrugged, &quot;You have to realize 
      that the air was filled in the mid-'60s with innovation and 
      experimentation.&nbsp; The baby boomers coming to college were brighter than 
      any cohort in history.&nbsp; We were not worrying about remedial work but about 
      offering the best challenge to bright minds.&nbsp; I suppose the Great Books 
      program at St. John's was lying under the surface of this suggestion.&nbsp; I 
      romanticized that purist approach to liberal learning.&nbsp; A few years later, 
      however, I modified my admiration a little when I had a long talk with a 
      St. John's alum.&nbsp; He felt deprived of the mainstream American academic 
      experience; he felt like a strange flower when he sought to get into the 
      workplace.&nbsp; Of course, my idea was at the other end of the spectrum from 
      the prescribed program at St. John's.&nbsp; I would have had the students and 
      the faculty invent their course of study from scratch.&nbsp; But my hope would 
      have been that they would end up studying the best of the brightest.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Nothing came of your 'manifesto'&quot;? asked 
      Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What came of it was that I learned by 
      looking around, relatively late in my life, at the academic landscape as 
      well as I could.&nbsp; I was still in a learning mode, and effusions such as 
      this 'manifesto' were the fallout from the process.&nbsp; Again I wonder at the 
      tolerance I experienced from those senior to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think they had an 
      owlish insight: the best way to kill off bad ideas was to allow them to 
      see the light of day.&nbsp; Their indulgence thus may not have come from 
      kindness but from a wary sense of how the battles are finally won.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Burkean,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch, maybe,&quot; Bodger 
      replied.&nbsp; &quot;Understand, the ruts of our curriculum ran deep, despite the 
      academic upheavals around the country at the time--and despite yawping at 
      the edges by people like me.&nbsp; Our ideas were possible only because of the 
      stability of what was in place.&nbsp; As colleges did away with core 
      requirements around the nation, we did not.&nbsp; Language requirements, for 
      example, held fast here, while their disappearance across the academic 
      landscape led to a deep crisis in those disciplines.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret looked at the clock.&nbsp; &quot;Duty 
      calls,&quot; she said and left.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterward, Bodger remained in his chair, 
      reflecting.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a mad, grand time, no matter how he came at it.&nbsp; He 
      was never so high again, probably.&nbsp; The camaraderie with bright young 
      people, the sense of being able to touch the strings of institutional 
      authority, the affirmation he received from DLH, the awareness that their 
      small scene was a microcosm of the national scene, on the edge of 
      momentous change, the self-assurance that came from being young and 
      healthy--&quot;Rich stuff,&quot; he said to himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The institution, of course, 
      was trying to find its way through an unanticipated moment of change in 
      social and educational values.&nbsp; It was in some ways a more threatening 
      time than the Depression '30s.&nbsp; Then, the threat was financial; now, the 
      threat was less definable and therefore less manageable.&nbsp; The youth 
      generation was eating away at underpinnings of American higher education 
      that had not been questioned theretofore.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, Bodger saw a self-centered 
      enthusiasm at play.&nbsp; He should have had more respect for the traditions of 
      the college.&nbsp; He should have had greater humility in the light of his thin 
      preparation for academic life and his inexperience.&nbsp; &quot;Grand time, though,&quot; 
      he said as he put away his papers.&nbsp; The word &quot;grand&quot; took his mind back to 
      a passage from his journal; he looked it up:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Plans afloat, sweeping gestures, 
      heroic terminology--it is a little grand to be this close to the center of 
      motion.&nbsp; I risk failing at so many things, but I don't care at all.&nbsp; There 
      is only an intoxicating sense of doing what I am to do, no regrets, no 
      fear.&nbsp; Things do not get done fast enough--that is the only frustration.&nbsp; 
      All else is the turning on of forces, which may well destroy the old 
      place, but I don't care.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;The passage bore the date 24 
      August 1967.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>Faculty terminations brought student protests</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next time they met, Margaret told Bodger 
      she had asked several students to write letters to the dean about her 
      teaching.&nbsp; &quot;Will it do any good?&quot; she asked him.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told her it might.&nbsp; &quot;Be warned, 
      however, that deans suspect faculty of coercing students into such things, 
      using their obvious power over them.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I would feel insulted if my dean thought 
      that of me.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;Of course you would. You 
      were not wrong to get them to write letters.&nbsp; Student voices have always 
      mattered on this campus, even when the students have not thought so.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her evaluation maneuver led Margaret and 
      Bodger back to their conversation about the late '60s.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, &quot;The students caught the 
      national fever.&nbsp; In the 1967-68 academic year, campus after campus came 
      under siege by dissident students.&nbsp; Harvard itself, the pinnacle of the 
      academy, found students sitting in University Hall, protesting Harvard's 
      alleged plans to tear down black housing for medical school expansion.&nbsp; 
      They were also protesting the ROTC program on campus.&nbsp; President Pusey 
      feared the students would rifle the confidential files in the 
      administration building.&nbsp; He called in police.&nbsp; Harvard Yard, like the 
      hallowed grounds of other colleges and universities, became a scene of 
      violent assault and resistance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Here at home, an administration decision 
      to terminate two young faculty members sparked the conflict.&nbsp; First Waldo, 
      in history, then Clymer, in English.&nbsp; They were my friends.&nbsp; Clymer 
      especially.&nbsp; The college had the right to hire and fire such nontenured 
      faculty.&nbsp; In a day when there were no formal evaluation criteria, the dean 
      and president, occasionally with the collaboration of a department head, 
      made staffing decisions based on informal feedback and their canny ability 
      to size up people.&nbsp; Usually a non-tenured faculty member who was not 
      renewed would simply fade away, leaving hardly a smudge on the blotter.&nbsp; A 
      number of them came and went in those years, particularly part-timers 
      hired for a specific annual need.&nbsp; Waldo and Clymer were well-credentialed 
      full-time instructors, however.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When Waldo learned that he was not going 
      to get a new contract, he told his students.&nbsp; Since he had not learned a 
      reason for the decision from the administration, he assumed that he was 
      being fired because of his outspokenness on politically sensitive issues 
      and on the conduct of the affairs of our college by the administration.&nbsp; 
      That was his report to his students.&nbsp; Appealing to the doctrine of 
      academic freedom and the need for intellectual vitality on our campus, 
      Waldo persuaded a following of students that the decision was unjust.&nbsp; 
      They saw in him a youthful spark plug who could stimulate debate and thus 
      advance knowledge in an interesting and attractive way.&nbsp; Waldo himself was 
      not shy about advancing that self-image.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Clymer was a non-aggressive and quiet 
      man.&nbsp; He sticks in my mind as nearly a saint.&nbsp; While he took none of the 
      self-serving steps with students that Waldo took, his name and Waldo's 
      became hyphenated in the amalgamation of a single hot issue.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pretty soon, the students precipitated a 
      statement from the president to explain the non-renewals of contract.&nbsp; He 
      said that the administration was interested in a continuing effort to 
      provide vitality, to bring in fresh ideas.&nbsp; To that end, it had adopted a 
      'new faces' policy.&nbsp; This was described as a periodic 'in and out' hiring 
      process for young faculty at the instructor level who were on their way to 
      permanent careers elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Waldo and students derided the statement 
      as an after-the-fact rationalization.&nbsp; The students then circulated a 
      petition calling on the college to retain the instructors.&nbsp; With 
      signatures from an estimated 80 percent of the student body, the leaders 
      presented their petition.&nbsp; The students presenting the petition came away 
      with a report that inflamed the situation.&nbsp; They quoted Helfferich to the 
      effect that most of the students did not know what they were signing.&nbsp; 
      Although his observation was probably accurate, it brought out protest 
      posters and escalated the student newspaper's campaign to retain the 
      instructors.&nbsp; To the Philadelphia press, it looked as if our college was 
      heading for the kind of disruption and violence widely reported at other 
      campuses, including Penn.&nbsp; We became 'protest' news, even though order had 
      not yet broken down.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But it did break down?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In fact it did not.&nbsp; Back in December 
      1967, when I first heard about the decision on Waldo, I had sent a blunt 
      dissenting note to the president, completely private between us.&nbsp; He had 
      made a ground rule when I began as his assistant that I could say anything 
      behind his closed door, however frank, however opposing, so long as I held 
      my tongue in public.&nbsp; I was glad that my Waldo note proved that the ground 
      rule could work.&nbsp; DLH did not get mad at me.&nbsp; However, when we talked 
      about it, he advanced the 'new faces' rationale and failed to convince 
      me.&nbsp; I was thinking of the intellectual fun created by Waldo among his 
      students and among us, his colleagues.&nbsp; Why not keep it up?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I decided at that point that the motives 
      for dismissing Waldo and then Clymer lay deep in the viscera of DLH and 
      the dean.&nbsp; I&nbsp; respected DLH enough to believe that at some level the 'new 
      faces' notion was bona fide; but at the same time, the decision seemed to 
      be simply wrong and unnecessary.&nbsp; Of course, I learned later that the 
      system of tenure made deans and presidents look ahead to see whether they 
      wanted to spend a lifetime with a new person--for that's what tenure 
      normally meant.&nbsp; I think more indulgently of the administration now than I 
      did then about the weighing of the merits of my two young friends.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;At the time, Waldo and even more so 
      Clymer seemed like innocents in a drama beyond their ken.&nbsp; I remember 
      comparing them to Yakov Bok in Bernard Malamud's <i>The Fixer</i>.&nbsp; He was 
      the target of forces beyond his understanding.&nbsp; The power that moved Bok's 
      world--and ours, said I--was not rational, it was visceral, from the 
      conditioned gut, which grunts before it allows for thought.&nbsp; Only 
      afterward did the grunts get sculpted and hammered into 
      reasonable-sounding shapes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The tragedy of Waldo, I said then, was 
      that he did not <i>know</i>; and the tragedy of DLH was that he did know 
      and still acted as he acted.&nbsp; The tragedy of Clymer was that he knew and 
      did not choose to resist.&nbsp; The tragedy of Bodger may have been that he saw 
      all this as tragedy rather than as the meat and potatoes of ordinary 
      institutional management.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;But the upset students 
      made it extraordinary, anyway, right?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was extraordinary for me, especially, 
      because my relations with the several players complicated things.&nbsp; I was 
      by now a confidant of the president on many matters, including this one.&nbsp; 
      Yet, I was a colleague and friend of Waldo and Clymer.&nbsp;&nbsp; As advisor to the 
      student newspaper, I was on good terms with the editor and other students 
      leading the protest.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I wanted to serve my boss and mentor as 
      well as I could.&nbsp; I wanted to be helpful to my faculty friends.&nbsp; I wanted 
      the students to voice their viewpoint without damaging their academic 
      careers and without bringing violence to campus--without bringing unwanted 
      media attention.&nbsp; I particularly worried that DLH would mistakenly 
      castigate the student leaders as mere hell-raisers.&nbsp; They were among our 
      best and brightest on campus.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;It was impossible for you 
      to serve them all equally.&nbsp; How did it play out?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the heat of discussions around the 
      campus, I sensed that a violent student eruption was becoming likely.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      After the student paper reported on the president's alleged slight to 
      students who signed the petition, student antagonism solidified.&nbsp; I heard 
      nothing from DLH that suggested any compromise.&nbsp; Waldo intensified his 
      public outcry against the decision.&nbsp; He cast himself as a cosmopolitan and 
      criticized the inbred character of the faculty and the college's culture.&nbsp; 
      He thus accused me as well, I guess, although the slight went over my head 
      at the time. The students' special flyers around campus hinted at violent 
      reactions if the administration did not heed the complaint.&nbsp; I worried 
      when I had to tell DLH that the students were inviting the Philadelphia 
      press to a massive armband protest in the making.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret asked, &quot;What would be so bad 
      about publicity?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In those days the college was not news, 
      good OR bad.&nbsp; Since then we've professionalized our media relations 
      program.&nbsp; The college works hard to get positive media attention.&nbsp; At that 
      time, the only interest the media would have had in us would have arisen 
      because of bad news.&nbsp; It is a little difficult to reconstruct the mood of 
      college administrators then.&nbsp; Many feared a headline could make them look 
      weak in the face of the student movement.&nbsp; No one fully understood the 
      root causes of the unrest across the nation.&nbsp; No one therefore had 
      developed a successful process for dealing with it.&nbsp; Why did Nathan Pusey 
      at Harvard make national headlines?&nbsp; Because even the president of what 
      was thought to be the best felt he had to process the takeover of his 
      administration building with nothing more sophisticated than police 
      muscle.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It sounds like the smoke from a paradigm 
      shift,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Except that that whole Thomas Kuhn 
      concept had not hit the street,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;Anyway, headline writers 
      didn't talk about paradigm shifts.&nbsp; They dealt in shouting matches and 
      bloody heads.&nbsp; I felt I should do what I could to prevent bad media 
      coverage while trying to find a way through the conflict.&nbsp; I envisioned an 
      outcome that would be acceptable to the administration, to Waldo and 
      Clymer, and to the student protesters.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Modest goal!&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It was a measure of my hubris as an 
      administrator at the time, perhaps--or of a more sinister pathology buried 
      deeper in my psyche.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">Margaret probed, &quot;An 
      irrational aversion to the uncontrolled?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">Bodger merely smiled and 
      continued, &quot;Plans for the armband protest proceeded.&nbsp; It now seemed likely 
      that the major Philadelphia papers would cover it.&nbsp; The leaders called for 
      the protest two days in advance and asked all students to take part.&nbsp; I 
      decided to make a try at conciliation.&nbsp; I went to DLH and asked whether he 
      would permit me to talk with the student leaders to seek an understanding.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He puffed his pipe and consented.&nbsp; Then 
      he gave me the themes to work with.&nbsp; Commend the students for their 
      peaceful way of petitioning (by implication, threaten them if they don't 
      do it that way henceforth).&nbsp; Tell them he and other alumni and board 
      members seek excellence for the college as zealously as anyone; neither 
      students nor Waldo and Clymer had exclusive title to the aspirations of 
      the college for quality.&nbsp; Validate students' claim to a voice in 
      governance by quoting the statement on student freedom recently endorsed 
      by the board.&nbsp; Say he is unsure how far apart he is from the students.&nbsp; 
      Set up a review that will shift the final position to the board and away 
      from him.&nbsp; He ticked off the particulars of a procedure he could accept.&nbsp; 
      Make absolutely no promise that Waldo and Clymer will be retained.&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
      said that I should take credit for the procedure and not tell them 
      immediately how much of it would fly.&nbsp; 'See what you can bring back,' he 
      said in effect.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I called one of the student leaders and 
      told him over the phone of a possible breakthrough.&nbsp; Could he meet with 
      me?&nbsp;&nbsp; I banged out a draft of a statement for possible publication next 
      day and showed it to him in the newspaper office.&nbsp; He was unhappy that 
      there would be no capitulation forthwith on the substantive decision to 
      terminate the two instructors.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'You've complained that you have no 
      voice in the process,' I said.&nbsp; 'This gives you a voice in the process.&nbsp; I 
      would to take it.'</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Despite this last-minute grousing, he 
      and the others were ecstatic.&nbsp; They had forced the top man to do something 
      he did not originally intend to do.&nbsp; I showed a final draft to DLH first 
      thing in the morning.&nbsp; It was a go.&nbsp; Within an hour a special issue of the 
      student publication was on the campus in mimeographed form.&nbsp; It called for 
      the originally planned show of support and solidarity for the instructors 
      and the wearing of black arm bands.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it declared that the 
      students' demands had been well treated.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;At a special meeting of the board the 
      following week, Waldo, Clymer, and a committee of students met with the 
      board members.&nbsp; The president absented himself and promised to abide by 
      the board's decision on the appeal.&nbsp; The students received the respect and 
      courtesy of the board members and said so afterward.&nbsp; Then the board heard 
      the president's case.&nbsp; It finally decided to reaffirm the non-renewal of 
      the two contracts.&nbsp; At the same time, it commended the students for the 
      serious and civilized character of their petition.&nbsp; Helfferich did too.&nbsp; 
      By that time spring break had started.&nbsp; As DLH knew, the heat of the fray 
      would leave campus with the students, who went in search of sunshine.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger produced the late-night statement 
      that led to the orderly resolution of the Waldo-Clymer affair and gave it 
      to Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Pretty prose it is not,&quot; he said to 
      Margaret.&nbsp; &quot;But it proved to me yet again that institutional management 
      can come down to a negotiation over words on a piece of paper.&nbsp; I think I 
      could say that I hardly ever faced a dilemma that did not in the end lead 
      me to put words on paper on which I would seek the agreement of others.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The statement was from the editors of the 
      newspaper and other student publications.&nbsp; It was headed simply &quot;SPECIAL 
      ISSUE&quot; and dated 13 March 1968.&nbsp; Bodger read it aloud while Margaret 
      stared out the window.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>'The following is a statement from 
      President Helfferich regarding the &quot;dismissals&quot; of Messrs. Waldo and 
      Clymer.&nbsp; We feel the students' demands have been fairly and most 
      satisfactorily treated</i>.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger interrupted himself: &quot;The student 
      leaders felt that this was a massive concession in the interest of getting 
      a compromise and they agonized about it before accepting it.&nbsp; But they 
      accepted it.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read on: &quot;<i>'We also commend the 
      student body for its reasonable actions through peaceable demonstration.'&nbsp;
      </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The student leaders knew that unreasonable actions through 
      disruptive demonstration were still possible.&nbsp; They didn't want us to 
      forget it even as they affirmed the reasonable course that they knew we 
      wanted.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is to be hoped that the college 
      community has learned a valuable lesson in student-administration 
      communications.'</i>&nbsp; DLH tolerated the supercilious tone of the students 
      with mild amusement.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>'Today, Black Wednesday, we must reaffirm our 
      support and solidarity for Messrs. Waldo and Clymer.'</i>&nbsp; They insisted 
      that the black armbands had to appear; the tradeoff was that the leaders 
      would discourage any other form of protest.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;DLH's statement follows this 
      introduction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here he was teaching me the lesson of changing position 
      while preserving control.&nbsp; In every management situation, I had learned&nbsp; 
      from my mentors that the preservation of one's authority in the face of 
      everything was axiomatic.&nbsp; It was not even discussed.&nbsp; It was a given.&nbsp; 
      This was an even more compelling axiom in the late '60s on a college 
      campus, where it had become evident that control by the authorities was no 
      longer a given.&nbsp;&nbsp; A corollary was, 'When you give a little, get a lot in 
      return for having given it.'&nbsp; DLH gave up the process and allowed a review 
      by his own&nbsp; board.&nbsp; In return he demanded and got a commitment of the 
      students to reasonable behavior, non-violence, and acquiescence in 
      whatever decision the board would reach.&nbsp; In fact, I would guess that most 
      of the students knew in advance that the board would reaffirm the 
      decision.&nbsp; But they had shown their muscle and could show that they had 
      done so.&nbsp; They had not been kicked out of college for it.&nbsp; In the end, I 
      had a hunch that their own fate became a concern to them.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger then read the text of the 
      president's statement in the Special Issue.&nbsp; Even after all the years, he 
      felt he could tell which phrases were Helfferich's, which were the 
      students', and which were his.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>'I am pleased to be engaged in 
      discussion of academic excellence with students.&nbsp; It is all too seldom 
      that students show concern for so fundamental a concept of liberal 
      education.&nbsp; Those students who have shown sincere concern for this concept 
      in recent days are to be commended.'</i> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Put yourself on common ground with the 
      opposition,&quot; Bodger commented and went on.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>'If&nbsp; the college is to grow great, it 
      needs academic excellence.&nbsp; I am for it and for the means of gaining and 
      preserving it.&nbsp; The issue of academic excellence has now been raised by 
      students, as is often the case, because of a particular set of 
      circumstances.'</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Note that DLH did not equate institutional 
      greatness and academic excellence.&nbsp; The latter was a subset of the 
      former.&nbsp; I clung to that distinction even after academic excellence came 
      to consume the agenda in my later years.&nbsp; Gradually, I think, it came to 
      distance me from some of my colleagues.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>'With a few exceptions I believe that 
      up to this moment the students have presented their views on this set of 
      circumstances in a manner acceptable at an institution of higher 
      education, where rational inquiry, discussion and debate are the primary 
      means of solving problems.&nbsp; The small independent college is the most 
      fitting place where rational discussion should control.'&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Bodger paused: &quot;The shadows of 
      violence at big places such as Cornell and Columbia are hovering in this 
      paragraph.&nbsp; The guardedness of this affirmation of students peeps out of 
      the phrase, <i>'up to this moment.'</i>&nbsp; Meaning: I think you kids could 
      lose control of the situation if you are not very careful.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'The college community is composed of 
      many groups, including the students, the faculty, the alumni, the Board of 
      Directors (the college's legal entity), the elected officers, and the 
      public.'</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the hurly-burly of campus life, 
      students and sometimes faculty failed to see this obvious diversity of 
      legitimate interests.&nbsp; The board especially seemed remote if not 
      irrelevant.&nbsp; When it adjudicated the case of Waldo and Clymer, of course, 
      students and faculty both had a refresher in governance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, though, 
      thought that the board would do whatever the president told it to do.&nbsp; I'm 
      sure he was confident that the board would do the right thing, although, 
      given the amount of publicity, his position was not invulnerable.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger read on: &quot;<i>'We must recognize 
      that all constituents of the college have pride in it and a concern for 
      its welfare.&nbsp; Our degree has lustre alone on the basis of the college's 
      excellence and the accomplishments of its students and alumni.&nbsp; As a 
      graduate and as president, I desperately want the college to be one of the 
      best small colleges in the United States.&nbsp; I am confident that desire is 
      shared by our alumni, our faculty, and our Board of Directors.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I am 
      confident it is shared no less by you students, who have shown your wish 
      for rigorous intellectual challenge in the classroom.'</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Take them at their word.&nbsp; Hoist them on 
      their own petard.&nbsp; Say by implication that youthful protest for its own 
      sake is not acceptable here.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret shook her head affirmatively and 
      said, &quot;Also, don't let the students take exclusive possession of the 
      institutional jewels.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You got it,&quot; Bodger affirmed and 
      continued reading:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'But we must also recognize that each 
      person and each group has differing views on the course the college should 
      set in pursuing excellence.&nbsp; In meeting its constituted responsibility to 
      make decisions for the college, the officers should ignore none of those 
      views.'&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That is,&quot; Margaret chimed in, &quot;you 
      students don't have exclusive ownership of the place.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Correct.&nbsp; <i>'I value responsible 
      student opinion and would be unreasonable to ignore a request from 80 per 
      cent of the student body.'&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Margaret warmed to the game: &quot;He 
      was saying that the petition and protest were not an outrage but simply a 
      very visible expression of appropriate constituency opinion.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger echoed, &quot;That is, don't get to 
      thinking you are pulling off a revolution here, kids,&quot; Bodger echoed.&nbsp; 
      &quot;Don't think you're too damned smart.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;<i>'On the specific matter in question, 
      up to this point I have been in disagreement with the petitioners' view.&nbsp; 
      I am unsure how far apart we are.&nbsp; I am willing to listen and to talk 
      about it by reasonable means--the only acceptable means in an intellectual 
      community.'</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This was Helfferich's special tactic.&nbsp; 
      Declare your position.&nbsp; Acknowledge the opposition to it.&nbsp; Concede on a 
      process for deliberating the conflict.&nbsp; Make sure the process allows you, 
      without guaranteeing it, to emerge the winner.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, disarm the 
      exuberance rampant among the students.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;Still, the students must 
      have been happy that he acknowledged he was unsure of anything.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Absolutely,&quot; Bodger said and read on.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'I quote from a draft &quot;Statement on 
      Student Freedom&quot; which has been reviewed by committees of the Board of 
      Directors and of the Faculty: &quot;It is desirable that students as well as 
      faculty members and administrators have appropriate influence in 
      reasonable discussion through existing structures of organization.&quot;'&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger commented: &quot;This statement emerged 
      out of the controversy over Madalyn Murray O'Hair's appearance the year 
      before.&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of board members, faculty, students, and I had crafted 
      it.&nbsp; We entered into that process to find a kind of closure to the O'Hair 
      affair.&nbsp; Note we used the word 'reviewed' rather than 'approved.'&nbsp; I doubt 
      if the board ever formally acted other than to review.&nbsp; But in this 
      situation, we at least had an institutional statement with community 
      authorship.&nbsp; We felt it gave an air of procedural normality in this 
      abnormal proceeding.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Next came a warning against violence and 
      a repetition of our commitment to excellence--the save-all mantra:&nbsp; <i>
      'Obviously, demonstrations resulting in personal or property damage would 
      be harmful to all students and faculty members concerned, to the dignity 
      of the college and, most important of all, to the cause on which we are 
      all united--that of intellectual excellence.'&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;You were obsessively 
      denying the students sole ownership of the issue of academic excellence.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No question,&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;Control 
      control control.&nbsp; Finally, after all this defining and positioning for the 
      sake of control, the statement tells the students what DLH will in fact do 
      about their call to keep Waldo and Clymer.&nbsp; A few days earlier, I had 
      privately written a suggestion that never went to him.&nbsp; It would simply 
      have referred the petition to a board committee, followed by a 
      presidential statement that the committee endorsed the non-renewal.&nbsp; I did 
      not think he would even go that far.&nbsp; But once he decided to draw the 
      board into the game, he realized that it had to act credibly.&nbsp; That 
      required an actual appearance of the aggrieved before the students would 
      believe a decision on the appeal.&nbsp; So that's the way it came out:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'I shall present the petition to the 
      Board of Directors on Friday, March 22, the earliest date on which the 
      Board can be assembled.&nbsp; The president of the Board of Directors has been 
      informed of the situation.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'A committee of students, to be 
      appointed by the Student Government Association, will be granted the 
      privilege of stating its views to the Board, as will Mr. Waldo and any 
      others who feel unfairly judged.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'Before the end of this week, I shall 
      request a meeting of the Academic Council of the Faculty to seek its 
      recommendations, which will be communicated to the Board along with the 
      petition.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'I promise to be bound by the 
      decision of the Board of Directors, and call upon the petitioners and all 
      others concerned to be bound also.'</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We wanted that final emphasis on student 
      acceptance of the Board's decision,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; &quot;We wanted to keep the 
      campus from disruption.&nbsp; Student passions had blown away similar 
      procedures elsewhere.&nbsp; We were doing everything we could to erect a 
      structure of actions that would withstand the zaniness lurking at the edge 
      of campuses that year.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ruffled the paper in the air and said, 
      &quot;The final paragraph is vintage Bodger: <i>'We have it on our grasp to 
      demonstrate to ourselves and others that our college is a place where 
      reasonable men and women, within the established framework of the college, 
      can act with dignity and responsibility in resolving its own problems.&nbsp; 
      That is a true measure of intellectual excellence.'</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This appeared on 13 March.&nbsp; On 22 March 
      the board would meet.&nbsp; In the interim, I had a date to speak in morning 
      chapel�chapel still clung to life but would soon disappear.&nbsp; I was 
      supposed to tell students and faculty about a new capital fund-raising 
      campaign just then being organized.&nbsp; I feared that the talk about raising 
      money would sound irrelevant or insensitive in the ears of people who for 
      days had heard the din of controversy over Waldo-Clymer.&nbsp; A favorite 
      student of mine had just said no when I asked if she would be on a panel 
      to talk about the need for one of the new buildings.&nbsp; She would have no 
      part in raising money for a college that would not rehire Waldo and 
      Clymer.&nbsp; I decided I had to talk about the fund-raising plans in the light 
      of the controversy.&nbsp; I argued that 'the issue' would help the capital 
      campaign, not hurt it.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;That must have been a 
      stretch to put on a happy face.&nbsp;&nbsp; How did you get to that conclusion?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I felt that, with the board all set to 
      act as an appeals court, the students and administration had shown 
      maturity in the face of possible disruption.&nbsp; Prospective donors would see 
      a viable college community in action, peaceable but vital, pursuing 
      academic excellence--while police had to come to other campuses to combat 
      disruption.&nbsp; I thought I could use the platform to reemphasize the 
      concession made by the administration and the expectation for order, 
      whatever the decision of the following week would be.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did students react?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I doubt that many listened.&nbsp; Chapel was 
      a place they had to be.&nbsp; Most were thinking about the work they were to 
      have done for the next class hour.&nbsp; I don't remember any reaction.&nbsp; Truth 
      is, with the president's agreement to a review, the issue quickly ceased 
      to be the main topic on campus.&nbsp; Campus moods are mercurial.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret asked, &quot;In the end, did the 
      students' view of these instructors make any difference?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">Bodger said, &quot;Did students 
      save their jobs?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Did students get something educational out of the 
      controversy?&nbsp; Surely.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thought a moment and said, &quot;I have 
      doubts now about having asked my students to write to the dean.&nbsp; In spite 
      of your encouragement.&nbsp; It won't do any good for them or me.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Don't have doubts,&quot; Bodger replied.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After she left, he read his journal for 
      27 March 1968:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all intermediaries and 
      compromisers, I suppose I appear badly to both sides.&nbsp; But I think I acted 
      out of a concern for reason: if this controversy could not be dealt with 
      reasonably, on a campus supposed to exist for the sake of reason, how 
      could the college justify itself?&nbsp; I feared the president would take the 
      hard, uncommunicative line he took in the O'Hair affair a year before.&nbsp; I 
      feared the students were sufficiently motivated and organized to take the 
      issue to the violent stage.&nbsp; The result of violence would have been 
      further hardening of the administration position, damage to property, 
      police intervention perhaps, student liability and resulting expulsions, 
      and loss of any hope for reinstating Waldo or Clymer.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It occurred to Bodger that over 
      the years he had kept up a friendly relationship with many of the student 
      leaders in the Waldo-Clymer affair.&nbsp; Perhaps he did not appear as badly to 
      them as he then had thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; That summer, he wrote a letter to Waldo.&nbsp; 
      Could they still say &quot;friend&quot; in the face of all the stupidities of 
      institutional existence?&nbsp; Whether or not, Bodger wished him well.&nbsp; He did 
      not recall hearing from Waldo again.&nbsp; Clymer bore no grudge against Bodger 
      or anyone else.&nbsp; He knew the destiny of Yakov Bok.&nbsp; He married that 
      spring, a handsome Russian Orthodox woman with a mad mother.&nbsp; Clymer and 
      his wife came to visit Bodger.&nbsp; They talked about the war and probably 
      Dostoyevsky.&nbsp; Bodger felt very good about that.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his journal, he said:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clymer emerges as the memorable one, 
      the still seeker in the depths so misunderstood by the skimming 
      administrative mind.&nbsp; In the end even the president wished he would be 
      saved.&nbsp; He worried that his own black chasms of thought might cause his 
      students to become lost.&nbsp; Haunted by the image of a good friend in 
      Vietnam, who unarmed himself and tried to persuade the villagers to 
      surrender and was shot as he came forward. &nbsp;Is that me? he asks.&nbsp; Would I 
      do that?&nbsp; Lord Jim.&nbsp; What struggle am I capable of?&nbsp; How far can I stretch 
      this wire?&nbsp; If I think to the ends of thought, will I go mad, or find 
      God?&nbsp; Or is it all the same?&nbsp; Whatever, it is lonely, a burden I must 
      carry to my apartment or my billet now that I am draft bait.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the objectivity and austerity and 
      fatalism, grandeur becomes possible.&nbsp; Yet the alienation of a friend 
      too--the gulfs that Position gouges between people in spite of 
      themselves.&nbsp; Waldo and Clymer are the first ones: I see a long procession 
      of faces growing distant, puzzlement or hatred in their eyes, seeing me 
      but failing to see what I see: the mystic swirl of civilization, the 
      inexorable, locked-in logic of a public role, the erosion of the private, 
      simple sympathy of a man for a man.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>He must have been drinking when 
      he wrote the passage that followed a page and a half later.&nbsp; It was of 
      Bodger on the field of carnage, shameless in a Walt Whitman stance:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say, Yes, let everyone go, let the 
      young sarcastic bright ones all go, let them flee from the bearded 
      warlords.&nbsp; They shall be replaced by more young ones, eager and bright, 
      loving life and students.&nbsp; They too shall see the tall battered swords of 
      the warriors and fight them and retreat and go to other battles.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet I shall remain, for I have 
      sheathed the swords and know of the dyspepsia after the battles.&nbsp; I shall 
      remain for I know what they are and they are as meaningful and meaningless 
      as the bright young ones.&nbsp; And there I shall remain and there I shall 
      swell with the blood of those that win and those that lose.&nbsp; I shall be 
      the third army, in splendid alliance with all and everyone.&nbsp; I shall win 
      and I shall lose.&nbsp; I shall count up my gains and losses and strike them 
      off as fairy tales.&nbsp; I believe and I do not believe.&nbsp; I think and I do not 
      think.&nbsp; I fight and I do not fight.&nbsp; My cunning is the cunning of the 
      race.&nbsp; I give it, I use it for it is ours all together.&nbsp; Let me help you 
      deceive yourself.&nbsp; Let me help you see the bone grating flesh at the base 
      of all.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Save me,&quot; Bodger muttered with a 
      smile.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Clymer and his wife visited him in 
      that spring of 1968, Bodger reflected on the administrative work that he 
      seemed more and more drawn to do.&nbsp; The creative challenge of the craft of 
      presidents, he saw, was that the materials--people, procedures, 
      policies--were both recalcitrant and immensely variable.&nbsp; Nothing held.&nbsp; 
      The artwork was of the moment, evanescent, made and gone.&nbsp; A balletic 
      leap.&nbsp; Yet even when gone, something of it remained to become an element 
      in the next creation.&nbsp; It was an exercise in real fiction.&nbsp; Realistic 
      illusion.&nbsp; Illusory reality.&nbsp; The deepest reality, the airiest fantasy, 
      all of a piece.&nbsp; There was the challenge.&nbsp; To make people!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>Bodger sought an alumni program with 
      intellectual substance</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret wondered one day how he had 
      overcome the credential gap with the faculty.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No offense,&quot; she said, &quot;but how could 
      anybody without an academic career track end up as a president of a 
      college?&nbsp; I can't picture the current faculty buying that.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tried to capture for her the 
      self-contained life of the mid-'60s faculty.&nbsp; They were familiar with 
      alumni who returned to campus to teach and saw Bodger in an established 
      pattern.&nbsp; Credentials mattered less than institutional identity.&nbsp; While 
      the faculty displayed some fine graduate school pedigrees, a 
      disproportionate number came from the University of Pennsylvania, where 
      Bodger earned the master's degree.&nbsp; The Penn label was almost as important 
      as the college's own in the eyes of some faculty.&nbsp; At least it denoted 
      familiarity with a style of mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; The intellectual tradition of the 
      college was not then demarcated primarily by the standard symbols of 
      accomplishment, books, articles, lectures given at professional meetings.&nbsp; 
      Those who published and received recognition from their peers elsewhere 
      provided the foil for the more indigenous life of the mind of the majority 
      on the campus.&nbsp; The full professor rank was not closed to those lacking 
      the Ph.D.&nbsp; Neither the president nor the academic dean had the Ph.D.&nbsp; That 
      was not to say that the culture of the campus was hostile to standard 
      academic distinction.&nbsp; Helfferich's predecessor, Norman E. McClure, was an 
      acknowledged Elizabethan scholar, a product of a great era under Felix 
      Schelling in the English Department at Penn.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, the faculty tended to be 
      egalitarian and functional in its approach.&nbsp; If teachers in class 
      generated good feedback from students, if they held their own in the 
      ongoing faculty conversation over coffee and donuts, they usually would be 
      favorably received, whether or not they wore colorful academic credentials 
      on their sleeves.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;I was surprised when I 
      arrived by their ready acceptance of me.&nbsp; It simply had not occurred to me 
      that I had any right to claim a place in academic life.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger told her that in his first couple 
      of years, the alumni relations program was at the top of his priority 
      list, starting in January 1965.&nbsp; It was for that primarily that Helfferich 
      hired him.&nbsp; It involved running the annual alumni fund, something new to 
      him, directing the alumni association, and editing the alumni magazine.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The fund raising and the alumni 
      relations program,&quot; Bodger said, &quot;involved a lot of smoke and balloons and 
      promotional hype, pretty thin stuff.&nbsp; However, a serious player had 
      preceded me in that position.&nbsp; He was a Reformed pastor, wrestling coach, 
      and instructor in religion, Dick Schellhase, '45.&nbsp; His family ties to the 
      place and his Reformed heritage gave him a legitimacy and seriousness of 
      purpose unlike the typical alumni promotional person.&nbsp; Like many pastors 
      in the '60s who were on campuses, he had a fire in his belly over the 
      current issues of social justice.&nbsp; He had strong roots in the traditions 
      of the denomination that started the college.&nbsp; But he was not a 
      traditionalist refugee from the current debate in the nation.&nbsp; He gave me 
      the feeling that in my position it would be acceptable to think and talk 
      about ideas and strongly held principles, especially those having to do 
      with peace and social justice.&nbsp; He enjoyed a family-like relationship with 
      Helfferich, grounded in their membership in the Reformed church network.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dick also had a reputation for good 
      teaching and collegial integrity among many faculty.&nbsp; He was a member of a 
      group of faculty who were loyal to the college and its heritage but openly 
      critical of some of the traditional practices on campus and sometimes of 
      the president or dean in particular issues.&nbsp; In one instance, a few years 
      before my arrival, Dick and others criticized when the president offered 
      an honorary degree to someone perceived to be a right-wing nut.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He told me after I arrived that it was 
      he who originally brought me to Helfferich's attention when they started 
      looking around for his replacement.&nbsp; He had decided to leave and become a 
      fund-raising head at his theological seminary.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did he know you?&quot; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not personally.&nbsp; I had corresponded with 
      him in his role as editor of the alumni magazine.&nbsp; With his encouragement, 
      I had sent him an article a couple of years before his job opened up.&nbsp; He 
      thought that my style of writing must betoken a style of thought that he 
      affirmed.&nbsp; Forever after, I credited him with getting me the job.&nbsp; Through 
      the years, I jokingly would blame him for all my subsequent sins of 
      commission and omission as a member of the college staff.&nbsp; We had that 
      between us.&nbsp; He was a friend in an oddly formal way.&nbsp; We did not see much 
      of one another.&nbsp; In my mind he gave my new job a certain air, and I 
      emulated him.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So--he had given the alumni job a 
      weightiness?&quot;&nbsp; Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Right.&nbsp; Knowing no better, I simply saw 
      his example and assumed that it was acceptable for me to take myself 
      seriously as a player on the campus.&nbsp; You would have had to be there at 
      that time to get the feeling of it.&nbsp; It's hard to imagine today.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interviews leading up to his being 
      hired also made Bodger think that his position had importance.&nbsp; After he 
      was interviewed by vice president James Wagner and by Helfferich, he was 
      told he would have to meet two alumni leaders before Helfferich would 
      reach a decision.&nbsp; One was Harold Wiand, president of the alumni 
      association.&nbsp; The other was Paul Guest, a member of the board of 
      directors.&nbsp; Wiand was a public relations executive with the railroad.&nbsp; 
      Guest, who graduated in the late '30s, was an attorney.&nbsp; They met Bodger 
      for lunch at the Union League in Philadelphia, just down Broad Street from 
      Bodger's office in the UGI building at Broad and Arch.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Although I was a graduate of the 
      college,&quot; Bodger said, &quot;I had no sense of the life of the organized alumni 
      group.&nbsp; I had given a small gift each year and written for the magazine, 
      but that was it.&nbsp; I had a very small circle of former classmates with whom 
      I had contact, but they were mainly high school friends.&nbsp; Like me, they 
      had trotted across the way to the local college as non-resident students 
      and did not engage with the college after graduation.&nbsp; So I did not know 
      the tribal customs of the alumni who were actively involved, like Wiand 
      and Guest.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I went to that meeting feeling 
      intimidated and ignorant.&nbsp; I sensed that Helfferich was surrounded by a 
      group of alumni heavy hitters who shared his religious position and who 
      protected the institutional walls with their money and righteousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
      was prepared to tell them that I was not really up to the job if I sensed 
      that the conversation was leading nowhere.&nbsp; The appearance of churchiness, 
      you see, still made me uncomfortable.&nbsp; I still suspected that all these 
      people were in some sort of salvation game that I could not understand.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;I can't believe that was 
      true of this place, even then.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger went on, &quot;Of course I was 
      inexperienced and uninformed.&nbsp; I passed the test at the Union League more 
      successfully than I realized at the time.&nbsp; A couple of things were in my 
      favor.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was corporate, for one thing, not 
      academic or religious.&nbsp; It surprised me that both men saw my little career 
      in Philadelphia companies as a plus.&nbsp; It gradually dawned on me that they 
      had a paternalistic--if not patronizing--attitude toward the academic and 
      religious professions.&nbsp; They were actively supporting the college to 
      nurture thought, morals, and values.&nbsp; They did not think that the learned 
      or sacred professions could support themselves.&nbsp; So they seemed to embrace 
      me as one of the band of brothers who shared a sense of duty to sustain 
      the college.&nbsp; We were the strong whose obligation it was to nurture the 
      valuable but vulnerable flowers within the academy.&nbsp; I knew the corporate 
      jargon of the time.&nbsp; Without fully realizing it, in my eight years as a 
      corporation man, I had acquired a pinned-down manner, a surface 
      efficiency, which they liked.&nbsp; They respected the job being done by my 
      boss, Charles Simpson, who headed up the city gas company.&nbsp; The fact that 
      Charlie, a fellow Union Leaguer, liked me meant a lot to them.&nbsp; My 
      corporate pedigree removed suspicions that I might be anti-business, or 
      politically to the left.&nbsp; In the '60s, these were important issues in the 
      world that Wiand and Guest occupied.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Also, by sheer chance, Wiand knew 
      Margot's family.&nbsp; Her father was a railroad man in Phoenixville with the 
      Reading Company.&nbsp; Wiand knew the Denithornes as good church-going people.&nbsp; 
      They were stalwarts of the Reformed church in town.&nbsp; Margot had grown up 
      in the denomination out of which the college emerged.&nbsp; To Wiand, this was 
      a fortunate circumstance.&nbsp; I must have skirted around the question of my 
      non-involvement in a church.&nbsp; Wiand's affirmation of the Reformed pedigree 
      of the Denithorne clan must have brushed that question aside in the 
      remainder of my conversation with him and Guest.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There was another thing going for me in 
      the meeting.&nbsp; I did not know it at the time, though.&nbsp; Helfferich wanted to 
      hire me.&nbsp; He had to have revealed his disposition to Wiand and Guest 
      before they met me.&nbsp; So their task was not to see if I was worthy of the 
      job.&nbsp; Their goal was only to see whether they could find cause why DLH 
      should <i>not</i> offer it to me.&nbsp; They wanted to be supportive of his 
      intentions if they could.&nbsp; And nothing in the interview appeared to make 
      them do anything but advise him to bring me aboard.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When I got into the job, the gravity of 
      that Union League meeting hovered in my consciousness.&nbsp; These were serious 
      people!&nbsp; There was something going on here that I did not fully grasp but 
      that must be important.&nbsp; Along with the heavy footsteps of my predecessor, 
      this gave a sense of importance to my new work that was seemingly belied 
      by its place at the margin of the central activity of the college, which 
      was academic.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;I can't picture you as 
      the alumni person.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger attempted to sketch his first 
      several years on the staff.&nbsp; As it turned out, he found that his work at 
      the margin made a better connection with the faculty and the academic 
      program than he would have anticipated.&nbsp; His own curiosity about the 
      academic enterprise dovetailed with his need to touch the imagination of 
      his alumni constituents.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Almost from the start in 1965,&quot; Bodger 
      said, &quot;I felt that I had to try to engage the alumni in the current life 
      of the campus if I was to get their attention and their financial 
      support.&nbsp; We had a small body of living alums, fewer than 7,000.&nbsp; They 
      were heavily concentrated on the east coast.&nbsp; The regional character of 
      the student body simply carried on into their afterlife as alums.&nbsp; I knew 
      I could get directly in the face of many alums with a modest investment of 
      time and travel.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;First and foremost, I thought of myself 
      then as a magazine editor.&nbsp; I thought that I could reach them all through 
      the medium of the magazine.&nbsp; I was like a kid in a candy shop, for the 
      budget was fairly generous, and the editorial focus of the magazine was 
      virtually mine alone to determine.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I found that only a handful of alumni 
      took an active part in the organized activities of the alumni 
      association.&nbsp; Either I had to involve an exponentially greater number of 
      people in its various committees or I had to reach them and motivate them 
      in a different way.&nbsp; Early on, I decided it would be impossible to 
      increase the direct activity of many alumni.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I drew upon my experiences as an 
      industrial relations person to develop a strategy.&nbsp; The magazine would be 
      central.&nbsp; It would portray an alumni program as it ideally ought to be.&nbsp; I 
      would set up activities that actually would take place, but their main 
      function would be as media events, to be reported in the magazine.&nbsp; The 
      people actually involved would be small parts representing the whole body 
      of alums.&nbsp; A typical alum would be somewhere out there reading about the 
      activities of the few and vicariously enjoy their experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Additionally, I would publish substantive articles and not just news about 
      the college and the alumni association.&nbsp; This was a sheer luxury for an 
      industrial editor whose editorial scope had been severely limited by the 
      company's agenda.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;Something manipulative 
      about offering vicarious experiences.&quot; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger agreed.&nbsp; &quot;I had long since found 
      that you did not build perceptions of corporate identity by striving to 
      convey the reality of it.&nbsp; Instead, you found just enough reality with the 
      right appearance, and then you built a superstructure of fancy on top of 
      it.&nbsp; In the process, you did not talk about other aspects of the reality 
      of the corporation that might complicate or muddy the impression desired.&nbsp; 
      The outcome, if done well, would be <i>consistent</i> with the character 
      of the organization either as it was or, more often, as it ought to be.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This does not sound good,&quot; said 
      Margaret, &quot;probably because I don't see what you're saying, exactly.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Take the simplest graphic example,&quot; said 
      Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;When an event took place on campus, you would want it to be well 
      attended.&nbsp; You would want a picture of it to show that it was well 
      attended.&nbsp; More often than not, alumni activities were not as well 
      attended as you would have liked.&nbsp; An audience would be scattered around 
      the auditorium, with many seats empty in between.&nbsp; You would have to stage 
      a photo to get the desired impression or have the photographer shoot from 
      an angle that would avoid as many empty seats as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; What was true 
      of getting the right photo was also true of making a vivid impression of 
      the college as a whole and the alumni involved with it.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I get the picture example,&quot; Margaret 
      said.&nbsp; &quot;How does it extend?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the ideal impression of the college, 
      I wanted to show a connection between the academic process and the alumni 
      body.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was taken by a thought from A. Whitney Griswold's book, <i>
      Liberal Education and the Democratic Ideal</i>, published in 1962.&nbsp; A 
      president of Yale, Griswold talked about the obligation for an alumnus to 
      continue learning after graduating.&nbsp; He spoke about the alumnus as a 
      'patron of learning.'&nbsp; That meant furthering the interests of higher 
      education and doing so preeminently by practicing self-education 
      throughout life.&nbsp; That would lead to the free and responsible life.&nbsp; In 
      the Cold War context in which Griswold wrote, alumni would preserve a 
      democratic way of life through their intellectual habits in opposition to 
      the communist hegemony.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I thought it could be the role of our 
      alumni program to help our graduates realize this noble role.&nbsp; It would be 
      self-serving in that it would lead to the pleasures of intellectual 
      discourse.&nbsp; It would be high-minded because it would contribute to the 
      tone of our society and to the welfare of higher education.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A far cry from begging for annual 
      gifts,&quot; Margaret observed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, but I assumed that gifts would come 
      when people felt that they were involved with the college in a meaningful 
      way.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the consent of the alumni board, 
      Bodger organized alumni volunteers and faculty members into a liberal arts 
      committee.&nbsp; Its mission was to make the connection between the academic 
      dynamics of the college and its alumni.&nbsp; Before the end of 1965,&nbsp; the 
      alumni magazine announced a new reading-discussion program.&nbsp; The topic was 
      a timely one in 1965, &quot;the war trap.&quot;&nbsp; The choice was not out of the 
      blue.&nbsp; It was taken from the syllabus of an experimental elective course 
      just introduced in the newly installed curricular plan, the Senior 
      Symposium.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seniors came together in an interdisciplinary spirit to 
      study major problems of the space age.&nbsp; It emphasized independent reading 
      and open discussion in small groups, focusing on current movements, ideas 
      and values.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor of history, Maurice Armstrong, 
      was the moving genius behind the new senior course.&nbsp; Armstrong had been 
      Bodger's favorite teacher of history in his student years.&nbsp; He turned to 
      Armstrong as his principal resource for the alumni program.&nbsp; It was he who 
      chose the title, &quot;the war trap.&quot;&nbsp; With some consultation among colleagues, 
      Armstrong also chose two book titles related to war for alumni to read.&nbsp; 
      The choices were <i>The Abolition of War</i> (Macmillan, 1963) by Walter 
      Millis and James Real; and <i>Winning Without War</i> (Anchor Doubleday, 
      1964) by Amitai Etzioni.&nbsp; The alumni association offered the books by mail 
      order.&nbsp; Bodger also published a supplemental bibliography on war in the 
      magazine, the titles provided mainly by the faculty, led by Armstrong.&nbsp; 
      Those who ordered the books became registrants in the Alumni Liberal Arts 
      Program.&nbsp; As such they became eligible to receive occasional mailings on 
      &quot;the war trap&quot; theme.&nbsp; These mailings included notices of television 
      productions, periodicals, new books, on-campus discussions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The winter 1965 announcement of the 
      program promised a feature for the next magazine on &quot;the war trap.&quot;&nbsp; This 
      in the spring 1966 issue was a pair of articles presenting differing views 
      on the vision of a disarmed world.&nbsp; One was by General Thomas S. Power, an 
      excerpt from his book, <i>Design for Survival</i>.&nbsp; Power saw a 
      demilitarized world as a pathological escape mechanism and advocated the 
      continued development of nuclear weaponry.&nbsp; Power was opposed to the idea 
      of &quot;one world.&quot;&nbsp; He feared that it would turn the democracies over to the 
      Soviet enemies without resistance.&nbsp; The other half of the feature was by 
      Arthur I. Waskow, an excerpt from his booklet, <i>Keeping the World 
      Disarmed</i>, published by the Fund for the Republic.&nbsp; Waskow claimed to 
      be no appeaser of communism, any more than Power; but he believed that 
      western democracy would have a good chance of winning against communism in 
      a demilitarized world.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cover of the spring 1966 issue 
      depicted a welded steel sculpture by local artist Bernard Brenner, who 
      recently had spoken on campus surrounded by some of his works.&nbsp; The cover 
      showed his semi-representational &quot;Achilles,&quot; a section of rounded steel 
      resembling a helmet, suspended on a neck-like stem.&nbsp; &quot;Is the ancient 
      institution of war obsolete?&quot; queried the accompanying cover heading.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The readings, occasional mailings, and 
      the magazine articles preceded spring alumni regional discussion meetings 
      on &quot;the war trap&quot; in 1966, organized by Bodger.&nbsp; They were led by Dr. 
      Armstrong and other faculty members and seniors participating in the 
      Senior Symposium.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spring readings were capped by a 
      seminar in June 1966 at the annual alumni day on campus.&nbsp; Two expert 
      voices on international affairs debated issues associated with &quot;the war 
      trap.&quot;&nbsp; They were Dr. James E. Dougherty of St. Joseph's College and the 
      Foreign Policy Research Institute of the University of Pennsylvania., 
      co-author of a book, <i>Protracted Conflict</i>; and Dr. Charles C. Price, 
      of the University of Pennsylvania, immediate past president of American 
      Chemical Society and a past president of the United World Federalists.&nbsp; 
      Like Power and Waskow, Dougherty and Price respectively offered 
      traditionalist and innovative tools for freeing us from &quot;the war trap.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;In view of the subsequent 
      Cold War story that culminated in Reagan's 'star wars,' the hard-line 
      military people seem to have won the debate, even in spite of the disaster 
      then bursting forth in Vietnam.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Demilitarization and world federalism 
      certainly did not bring down the Soviets,&quot; Bodger agreed.&nbsp; &quot;No one 
      realistically in 1966 was thinking of bringing them down.&nbsp; Containing them 
      was more than enough to chew.&nbsp; In truth, the Soviets may have been the 
      main instruments of their own undoing, not our militarization.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret nodded in agreement: &quot;They 
      sprung us from their war trap and left us to fight the dirty little desert 
      and mountain wars that followed.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The theme today might be, 'war traps,'&quot; 
      Bodger concluded.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret asked, &quot;Was 'the war trap' 
      program like that doctored audience photo you talked about?&nbsp; Something of 
      a falsehood?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Too harsh a judgment, I hope,&quot; said 
      Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;Everything really took place.&nbsp; The participation was modest at 
      best.&nbsp; The publicity made considerably more of it than the alumni as a 
      whole did.&nbsp; It was successful enough to persuade the association to accept 
      my recommendation to try another round in the following year.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not more war.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;'The Paradox of Urbia,'&quot; said Bodger.&nbsp; 
      &quot;The discussion leading up to this choice in the committee was memorable.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger pulled down from a shelf the 
      Winter 1966 issue of the alumni magazine and read:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee members talked over a 
      great range of current issues and problems.&nbsp; Someone suggested readings in 
      American Negro thought.&nbsp; One of the students proposed a comprehensive 
      bibliography on the emerging non-Western nations.&nbsp; This led another to 
      wonder where the U.S. stood with its Alliance for Progress program.&nbsp; But, 
      asked a faculty member, don't all these relate in some way to changing 
      moral values and couldn't that topic tie together a lot of things?&nbsp; 
      Another staff member pointed out that the topic of modern values, along 
      with modern art and the impact of space exploration, was a theme for this 
      year's Senior Symposium course on campus.&nbsp; Well, asked a former Curtain 
      Clubber, why not read something on modern theater, and have an alumni 
      group put on a stage performance on Alumni Day?&nbsp; The talk returned to 
      moral values; the nature of violence became wrapped up in the nature of 
      modern life--urban, fast, confusing.&nbsp; So the topic was finally chosen, by 
      a free-wheeling, no-holds-barred exchange of ideas, some carefully thought 
      out ahead of time, others--like the problem of cities--popping into 
      someone's head because of something someone else said.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;We offered Raymond 
      Vernon's<i> The Myth and Reality of Our Urban Problems</i>, Harvard Press, 
      1966.&nbsp; And we suggested a spicy list of other books.&nbsp; Among them was a 
      book that even then was taking its place as a classic in the literature of 
      modern cities, Jane Jacobs's <i>The Death and Life of Great American 
      Cities,</i> published in 1961.&nbsp; It was Jacobs's voice that sounded the 
      charge on the megaplanners who were ignoring people and glorifying 
      functional megabuildings.&nbsp; We also suggested Harvey Cox's <i>The Secular 
      City</i>, still being read widely after its 1965 publication.&nbsp; Cox was 
      attractive because, as a preacher, he affirmed the beat of urban life that 
      seemed to jar conventional religious sensibilities.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second year of the reading and 
      discussion program followed in the track of the &quot;war trap&quot; program of 
      1965-66.&nbsp; Bodger ran a piece in the magazine about an urban inner-city 
      ministry in Louisville, led by a preacher of the class of 1943.&nbsp; The 
      preacher wrote approvingly of the embrace of urban life in Cox's book.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I also ran an interview,&quot; Bodger said, 
      &quot;with two blue-collar black fellows I had befriended at the gas works when 
      I worked there.&nbsp; 'Negro Voices of&nbsp; the City.'&nbsp;&nbsp; These guys today look 
      rare.&nbsp; They had worked for the company steadily for a long time.&nbsp; One was 
      a World War II vet, the other a veteran of Korea, about my age.&nbsp; Both were 
      married with families, steady and stable citizens who lived in North 
      Philadelphia and Overbrook.&nbsp; It was not uncommon in the 'ghetto' in the 
      late '60s to see respectable and safe black neighborhoods of working class 
      people.&nbsp; My daughter, who was then four years old, still remembers our 
      visit to Lester's home.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I felt I had found a frank way of 
      talking about race when I would see them around the stores department of 
      the company.&nbsp; They seemed to trust me up to a point.&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably my naivete 
      came through: 'What does this innocent white boy know?'&nbsp;&nbsp; I was obviously 
      not a threat.&nbsp; I stayed in touch with Lester after leaving the company and 
      coming to the college.&nbsp; I tried to help him place his daughter in 
      college.&nbsp; She went through the early stages of application here.&nbsp; She was 
      interested in art and we had no major in it.&nbsp; I still have a painting she 
      did as a gift for me.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I invited him and his younger friend, 
      Bob, out to the college.&nbsp; They came in suit and tie, looking like two 
      Sidney Poitiers coming to dinner.&nbsp; They said that their apprehensions grew 
      the farther they drove out Germantown Pike from the city.&nbsp; The white 
      suburbs felt like alien turf to them--it was, of course.&nbsp; But they sat 
      with me for an hour in my office on campus and talked candidly in front of 
      a tape recorder.&nbsp; Then I took their picture, out on Main Street.&nbsp; They 
      carried notebooks in hand and walked purposefully into the eye of the 
      camera.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;After three decades, I still think the 
      article is interesting,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; He handed it to Margaret.&nbsp; She 
      looked Lester and Bob in the eye and scanned the article.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret read from Bodger's lead-in to 
      the interview: <i>&quot;'Both men agreed to take part in this discussion for 
      one main reason.&nbsp; They believe that the real hope for black-white 
      relations lies in showing the white man what the black man really thinks 
      and feels.&nbsp; In their experience, white men rarely relax their complicated 
      racial defenses and speak to them man to man.'</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Then you invoke James Baldwin's voice,&quot; 
      Margaret said, &quot;with a pretty heavy-handed editorial club: <i>'What we 
      hear&nbsp; in these voices is an expression of the rage that Baldwin says is in 
      the blood of every Negro alive (in </i>Notes of a Native Son<i>).'</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&quot;'It is one of the ironies of 
      black-white relations'--</i>you continue citing Baldwin<i>--'that, by 
      means of what the white man imagines the black man to be, the black man is 
      enabled to know who the white man is.'&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And vice versa,&quot; Bodger said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's what you said next.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret read aloud from parts of the 
      interview:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men were asked what one thing 
      they would change that would do more good than anything else.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Coleman: &quot;You really want to 
      know?&quot;&nbsp; (Laughing)&nbsp; &quot;You got a shotgun?&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. McRae: &quot;No, the one thing you 
      could change would be a very intangible thing, people's attitudes, their 
      minds.&nbsp; That's about the only thing.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Coleman: &quot;I agree.&nbsp; I think the 
      white man must get to know the Negro, which he don't.&nbsp; That's the biggest 
      problem--he thinks he knows him but he don't.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned to the discussion of 
      the new Black Power message of Stokely Carmichael:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Coleman: &quot;I think he's all 
      right--but not if I listen to what the white man says about him.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. McRae: &quot;I think he's good, he's a 
      necessity, whether you agree with him or not.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Coleman: &quot;Whether you agree with 
      him or not: that's not the question.&nbsp; The question is, is this right or is 
      it wrong, the things he does and says about Black Power.&nbsp; Because we, the 
      Negro race, have tried every way we know possible to, what shall I say, 
      better ourselves or whatever it is, and nothing has come of it.&nbsp; So we 
      can't be wrong in supporting Stokely if his way's working.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret then read what they said 
      about the Great Society civil rights legislation recently passed in the 
      Johnson administration.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did either man see any concrete 
      results from the Philadelphia poverty program?</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Coleman: &quot;No.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. McRae: &quot;Nothing....In employment, 
      the prejudices are dressed up a little bit more than they were fifteen or 
      20 years ago.&nbsp; But I don't think the legislation makes all that much 
      difference.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Coleman: &quot;It doesn't help much, 
      all they have to do is say they didn't want someone with this or that 
      qualification.&nbsp; There are so many ways of getting around it.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>She went to the discussion of 
      open housing policy.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. McRae: &quot;I have two daughters, and 
      I think they're beautiful.&nbsp; Maybe you have two sons next door, practically 
      the same age.&nbsp; You think they're gonna grow up around these girls without 
      ever looking at them as girls?&nbsp; This is what worries people--what's gonna 
      happen in the years to come living this close to the Negro family?&nbsp; But 
      beyond that, I think the average person prefers to live in a neighborhood 
      with his own people.&nbsp; I feel better in a neighborhood where my kids can go 
      out on the street and nobody's going to insult them.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;After an exchange 
      on media bias on rape by blacks, you bring in another big literary name.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm sure I was using it in my English 
      comp class,&quot; Bodger said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She read:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So say two voices of the city.&nbsp; 
      Hearing them, we recall hopefully what Ralph Ellison's hero says at the 
      end of�</i>Invisible Man<i>: &quot;The very act of trying to put it all down 
      has confused me and negated some of the anger and some of the bitterness.&nbsp; 
      So it is now that I denounce and defend...I sell you no phony forgiveness, 
      I'm a desperate man--but too much of your life will be lost, its meaning 
      lost, unless you approach it as much through love as through hate.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She applauded his use of literary 
      spice.&nbsp; &quot;A little dab here, a little dab there,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;If I were a 
      faculty member reading this, I would wonder about the college magazine as 
      a polemical tool.&nbsp; You had a message.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Sure,&quot; Bodger replied.&nbsp; &quot;But thirty 
      years ago, a segment of faculty thought I was asking right questions and 
      dealing with them in a fresh way.&nbsp; It sure wasn't scholarship.&nbsp; But I was 
      dealing with timely issues and making defensible bibliographic 
      references.&nbsp; And, by the way, I was presenting a tone that differed 
      noticeably from the conservative vibrations sent out by the administration 
      about life in general.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I involved some of the faculty in the program 
      for the alums.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret thumbed through the rest of the 
      magazine.&nbsp; She found another article on &quot;the paradox of urbia.&quot;&nbsp; Dr. Rosa 
      Wessel of the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work gave a talk 
      on alumni day about the urban black slum.&nbsp; She referred to third 
      generation families on public welfare in the cycle of dependency.&nbsp; Dr. 
      Wessel told her alumni audience that she saw hope for their future in the 
      principles of reform adopted by the Johnson administration.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;Rosa was the wife of Herman 
      Wessel, our education department head.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;She didn't predict the future very 
      well,&quot; Margaret said.&nbsp; &quot;The Johnson program set the stage for more 
      dependency for another thirty years.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But having her on the program put lines 
      of connection out to the faculty.&nbsp; I was with them in an unusual way.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret shook her head: &quot;It should not 
      have counted for so much.&nbsp; You were just on the surface.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;In another time, in another 
      place, yes.&nbsp; Here, then, I had the feeling that it counted enough to make 
      me something of a member of the club.&nbsp; I imagined that few understood 
      where I was coming from.&nbsp; How could they?&nbsp; I did not fully know myself.&nbsp; 
      But I seemed to be interested in the right things.&nbsp; I seemed to want to 
      engage with them in a style that differed from that of DLH and the dean.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>Finding a way to teach English</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone later, Bodger thought he tried too 
      hard to show Margaret how his alumni programming connected him with the 
      academic life of the faculty.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he had entered the classroom.&nbsp; 
      He had held his own in faculty debates about changing the curriculum.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After his first couple of years as a 
      follower of the young instructors of the English Department, Bodger struck 
      out more on his own by the 1968-69 academic year.&nbsp; The &quot;yellow paper 
      project&quot; would happen some years later, but in the late '60s he was 
      already looking for new ways to challenge freshmen in English 
      composition.&nbsp; The students were bright.&nbsp; They mastered the 500-word-paper 
      format and the major grammatical issues in the fall semester.&nbsp; Bodger 
      tried something new in the spring.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had read an article in <i>College 
      English</i> (November 1967) by one Charles Deemer called &quot;English 
      Composition as a Happening.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Happenings&quot; were in the air on campuses as 
      well as on the streets.&nbsp; He said to himself:&nbsp; &quot;Forget about 'covering' a 
      body of material.&nbsp; Look for an understanding of the 'creative process.'&nbsp; 
      Show that expression in literary art can be compared with expression in 
      non-verbal art.&nbsp; Require students to write a journal.&nbsp; Let students have 
      enough freedom in writing assignments to talk about something that <i>
      matters</i> to them.&nbsp; (It was easy to assume in the late '60s that they 
      would be able to identify something that mattered to them--an assumption 
      that became harder to maintain as the tension of the '60s waned.)&nbsp; Shed 
      the role of 'professor' of a subject matter and adopt the role of 'fellow 
      inquirer,' different mainly in that I have lived longer and read and 
      thought some things they may not have read or thought.&nbsp; At the same time, 
      acknowledge that I have not read some things and not thought some things 
      that they have.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger stressed creativity in the 
      course.&nbsp; He had to get the students past the feeling that this was one 
      more professorial ploy of some phony sort.&nbsp; He assigned a menu of standard 
      readings on creative process by Susanne Langer, Jacob Bronowski, C. Day 
      Lewis and Archibald MacLeish.&nbsp; Then he verged away from the traditional 
      track of the course by inviting the students to make themselves 
      &quot;laboratory specimens.&quot;&nbsp; They were offered the chance to write a poem 
      themselves.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Be brief; be honest with your thoughts 
      and feelings; be as free as you wish from conventional restraints of 
      grammar, or metrics.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All but one of the class members took him 
      up on the offer.&nbsp; He reproduced about half of the resulting pieces and 
      distributed them anonymously for class discussion.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;An eye-opener,&quot; a few of the students 
      agreed after the class discussion.&nbsp; Bodger had discovered a fundamental 
      fact about college freshmen.&nbsp; If he paid as much attention to their 
      expression as he did to that in the standard canon, he would win their 
      interest and attention.&nbsp; Of course, he had to assume that in almost any 
      piece by a student, something virtuous could be found and highlighted.&nbsp; He 
      had to find it amid the dross of over-blown or under-imagined prose.&nbsp; 
      Usually, he did.&nbsp; He felt that every student had a spark of a universal 
      fire, however dampened it might be by upbringing or inexperience.&nbsp; Only 
      such an optimistic feeling--it was not at the level of a conviction--could 
      have driven Bodger to experiment as he did with the class. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still trying to identify the problem of 
      what literature IS, he played a tape of Wallace Stevens reading his <i>The 
      Idea of Order at Key West</i> early in the semester.&nbsp; Bodger thought of 
      that recording as something almost beyond belief.&nbsp; Stevens had been dead 
      for more than a decade; yet his cadences, his crystal imagery, sounded 
      like a glimpse at the day after tomorrow to Bodger.&nbsp; The voice of Stevens 
      pulled at him like a siren.&nbsp; He felt that if his students heard it they 
      would at least witness creative action at its highest, even if they did 
      not know what it &quot;meant.&quot;&nbsp; He asked the class to picture themselves with 
      &quot;pale Ramon Fernandez,&quot; looking off at the &quot;glassy lights&quot; of the bay in 
      the distance, wondering what was real and what was imaginary.&nbsp;&nbsp; A short 
      discussion followed; the students wanted to believe in Bodger's own 
      enthusiasm for Stevens.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He brought the tape recorder back to 
      class again the next day.&nbsp; Before any students arrived, he arranged the 
      seats in a circle.&nbsp; As they came in, the recorder already was playing 
      Wanda Landowska's rendition of Bach's <i>Goldberg Variations</i>.&nbsp; Bodger 
      then confounded their orthodox expectations.&nbsp; He said nothing about the 
      music--no lecture point, no harangue on creativity.&nbsp; This drove a deeper 
      fissure into the old monotonous surface of the classroom.&nbsp; Henceforth the 
      students on their own moved seats into a circle as they entered class.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day an incoming phone call made him 
      late for class.&nbsp; Finally arriving, he found that the students had lined up 
      the chairs in orthodox rows--except that they all faced a rear corner 
      instead of the front of the classroom.&nbsp; The students had decided that the 
      circle, however conducive to conversation, was getting them back into a 
      rut.&nbsp; Their decision identified the mood that they had found for the 
      remainder of the course--play merging with thought.&nbsp; Bodger felt good.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great test of their new mood, 
      however, came when Bodger announced they would have to write a 2,500 word 
      essay, five times longer than anything anybody else was writing in other 
      comp sections.&nbsp; The piece could be fiction if the student preferred.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Foul,&quot; somebody said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We can't say that much about one thing,&quot; 
      somebody else said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lobbying movement against the 
      assignment erupted before Bodger's eyes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The assignment stands,&quot; he said, 
      quelling the dissidence.&nbsp; &quot;But I hear your pain.&nbsp; Tell me about it on 
      paper.&nbsp; Start a journal.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The journal was ungraded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Entries could 
      be long or short.&nbsp; They could say anything they wished.&nbsp; The only 
      requirement was that to write a journal entry at least once a week.&nbsp; When 
      Bodger read their gripes about the long assignment, he wrote his reactions 
      and suggestions.&nbsp; That led students to react to his comments in their 
      subsequent journal entries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this journal &quot;dialogue&quot; he tried to 
      find the aspect of the literary problem that attracted each person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
      jockeyed each one toward a topic and toward suggested extra readings.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In time their journals became the medium 
      for comments on class readings, on campus controversy (marijuana use, 
      dormitory rules), on their relationships with fellow students.&nbsp; Bodger 
      became the peripatetic commentator, his words on paper privately directed 
      to each journal keeper.&nbsp; This new experience would lead him later to write 
      a proposal for a course based on&nbsp; &quot;epistolary pedagogy.&quot;&nbsp; The entire 
      course would consist of letters from and to each student.&nbsp; The instructor 
      would select meaningful passages from the letters and duplicate them for 
      the class.&nbsp; Many years later, electronic mail and Internet &quot;discussion 
      lists&quot; reminded him of his experiment of years before.&nbsp; The ease of 
      communicating informally with students made Bodger an early supporter of 
      the new technologies.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger introduced a non-verbal project 
      into the course for two reasons.&nbsp; One, it came at the question of &quot;what is 
      creativity?&quot; from a different artistic angle.&nbsp; Two, it dramatized the 
      spirit of play that Bodger felt was an essential ingredient in any 
      thinking about creativity.&nbsp; The object was to see what could be learned 
      about creative writing by looking at creative non-verbal expression.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each student had to show and tell about 
      the product of his or her imagination.&nbsp; Bodger could remember none of the 
      presentations concretely, except his own.&nbsp; It was an abstract rendering of 
      white lines on a black field, seeking to convey the feeling of 
      release-and-capture in Kafka's short story, <i>The Bucket Rider</i>.&nbsp; He 
      had seen it not long ago in a dusty corner of the cellar and wondered why 
      he had saved it for so many years.&nbsp; Bodger could only remember that many 
      of the students enjoyed doing their non-verbal project.&nbsp; He doubted that 
      they got the conceptual lesson intended.&nbsp; At the time he concluded that at 
      least they were confronted with the notion--through the very fact of the 
      assignment--that <i>something</i> about literature <i>may</i> relate to 
      non-literary expression.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, he knew it could look like a Mickey 
      Mouse approach in the eyes of other faculty members; he did not keep it in 
      his teaching arsenal for the future.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger knew that his bag of tricks could 
      bring more general criticism from other faculty.&nbsp;&nbsp; The culture of the 
      campus made it clear that students ought to do a lot of work and faculty 
      ought to stick to their business in class; fun and games were not highly 
      prized in the classrooms.&nbsp; To avoid coming under criticism, Bodger 
      experimented on top of the grunt requirements of the composition course, 
      not instead of them.&nbsp; The students in all of the English comp sections 
      were required to read a batch of short stories, a bunch of poems, and 
      three novels: Camus's <i>The Fall</i>, Malamud's <i>The Fixer</i>, and 
      Meredith's <i>The Egoist</i>.&nbsp; Bodger pushed this reading through class 
      discussion, some quizzes, encouragement to the students to comment on the 
      reading in their journals, and essay questions in his final exam.&nbsp; He 
      carefully calibrated the amount of writing done by his students to equal 
      that done in the other sections, where the standard 500-word papers were 
      assigned.&nbsp; He thus guarded his flanks against conservative criticism while 
      siding with younger instructors like Mel Ehrlich and Mike Foster, who 
      flouted the old ways of teaching.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He decided at the end of the semester 
      that the central question of the course--what is the creative 
      process?--was of doubtful importance.&nbsp; It helped him organize the course, 
      but he found that the students as a whole did not pursue the question with 
      great interest to the end of the semester.&nbsp; Their critical reading of 
      texts turned out to be more or less the standard stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; They did 
      perceive, however, that the question led to <i>themselves</i> as worthy 
      objects of attention, and that satisfied Bodger.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his self-evaluation of the course, he 
      preserved two student comments, the kind that since Socrates has made 
      teachers feel justified in their antics.&nbsp; One day he told Margaret about 
      his experiences in the course.&nbsp; Then he read the two comments:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>For the first time in thirteen years 
      of English classes, I'm interested in the subject and have been 
      considering changing my major....I have learned much concerning my own 
      capacity to create.&nbsp; I received far more satisfaction from writing my 
      short story than from almost any other single creative endeavor this 
      year.&nbsp; I have uncovered a new and challenging field into which to channel 
      my efforts, a new mode of expression, and I am grateful.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>And then:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the year the year progressed I 
      began to grope for one interrelating idea to the instructor's method and 
      refused to accept the idea of &quot;literature the work of art&quot; as the ultimate 
      point.&nbsp; Far more important than this, I realized, is the responsibility of 
      &quot;me-the-intellect&quot; to read and analyze the great literary works, both for 
      my own satisfaction and betterment, and for the benefit of those 
      &quot;intellects&quot; that will follow after me.&nbsp; I came to an appreciation not of 
      the literary arts but of myself as an intelligent human being who holds 
      not only the ability but also the responsibility to read the enthroned 
      writings of this time in an analytical manner.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This is stuff that gives 
      teachers goose bumps,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Allow for some flattery of the teacher.&nbsp; 
      And I didn't save the other ones,&quot; Bodger said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Hey, two converts out of twenty--okay.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is evangelism of a kind,&quot; Bodger 
      agreed.&nbsp; &quot;If you recognize that, you get beyond the definition of subject 
      matter as the essence of curriculum.&nbsp; You don't avoid the subject matter.&nbsp; 
      But the students see that it is fundamentally not what the whole business 
      is about.&nbsp; Ninety percent of the time they have to concentrate on the 
      subject matter.&nbsp; Still they know that's not what it's about.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have a hunch,&quot; Margaret said, &quot;that's 
      what your faculty colleagues could see in you.&nbsp; You were an enthusiast for 
      ideas.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If so, that's what got me by as an 
      interloper in their professional midst.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It would have been enough,&quot; Margaret 
      said, &quot;to get you by academically when it came time to put you in the 
      presidency.&nbsp; They could see that you could be their advocate.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There also was the curriculum debate.&nbsp; 
      When I first came to campus to work, the president had stirred up a 
      curriculum review.&nbsp;&nbsp; The climate for debate seemed to be free-wheeling, 
      something DLH could generate.&nbsp; So I jumped in, not knowing how little I 
      knew.&nbsp; But I read Daniel Bell's book about the Columbia curriculum and 
      some standard stuff on the liberal arts curriculum.&nbsp; I knew Newman and 
      Arnold from college and understood the heart of the modern tradition of 
      liberal education.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had learned about it from some of the very voices 
      now in the campus debate.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Were they really interested in changing 
      the curriculum?&quot; asked Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;At the time, I think DLH was 
      ambivalent.&nbsp; The maverick in him made him want the faculty to be more 
      exciting to students.&nbsp; Not being a man of an academic discipline, he could 
      not lead by example.&nbsp; His predecessor, McClure, was the quintessential 
      scholar of English lit.&nbsp; He was respected for his work on the 
      Elizabethans, Shakespeare especially.&nbsp; His classes were classically 
      medieval.&nbsp; We sat and listened, for the most part.&nbsp; I enjoyed his classes, 
      but DLH never could have taught like that.&nbsp; Nor could I.&nbsp; DLH didn't teach 
      at all. But he read the literature on pedagogy.&nbsp; He knew the rising pitch 
      in the '60s had something to do with youthful expectations.&nbsp; He was an 
      exhibitionist and thought that teaching always should be dramatic.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;On the other hand, the conservative in 
      him made him suspicious of novelty.&nbsp; He knew it would cost more.&nbsp; And, 
      anyway, he knew he could not impose it.&nbsp; So he allowed the faculty 
      deliberative process to grind away in its own time-consuming way.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
      think he figured that, sooner or later, they would come up with 
      something.&nbsp; It would be less than desirable, probably, but it would allow 
      him rhetorically to point to it as progress.&nbsp; He probably thought that, if 
      they at least would refer to the current movement toward 'integration of 
      knowledge,' he would not care about the substance of changes, so long as 
      he could afford them.&nbsp; He never told me any of this.&nbsp; I'm guessing.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Did the faculty want to change?&quot; 
      Margaret asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I soon discovered there is not a 
      faculty.&nbsp; There are faculties.&nbsp; Some wanted change.&nbsp; Others thought it was 
      newfangled nonsense.&nbsp; They knew what they were teaching.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So, they actually revamped the 
      curriculum after you got here?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Only after years of deliberation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
      dean summarized the process for an article in the magazine in spring 
      1966.&nbsp; He traced a lengthy path.&nbsp; I think it all began as a 
      half-surreptitious faculty movement in the early '60s, years before I came 
      aboard.&nbsp; They called it the core committee and then the planning 
      committee.&nbsp; By the summer of 1964, one of the bright young lights, Dave 
      Hudnut in English, received a stipend to write a lengthy report on the two 
      years of deliberation already behind them.&nbsp; A year more of discussion took 
      place.&nbsp; Then Jerry Hinkle, a bright young Philosophy and Religion 
      professor, pulled the ideas on the table into a package.&nbsp; In the fall of 
      1965, the faculty department heads had a major shot at the Hinkle draft 
      and changed it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;After another academic year 
      of discussion and compromise,&nbsp; the new curriculum was announced in the 
      spring of 1966.&nbsp; It was implemented for the 1966-67 academic year.&nbsp; A new 
      set of categories came in, based on the metaphor of the 'core.'&nbsp; It led to 
      'pivotal' courses that were required and to 'radial' courses that were 
      elective.&nbsp; It legitimized the truly innovative experiment in the teaching 
      of introductory science.&nbsp; This course combined chemistry, mathematics, and 
      physics into a single integrated course for science majors.&nbsp; It started as 
      an experiment a couple of years before, put together by three veteran 
      teachers, all alumni and custodians of the mystique of science at the 
      college�Blanche Schultz, '41, Evan Snyder, '44, and Roger Staiger, '43.&nbsp; 
      It created a 'senior symposium,' an elective course with loose structure, 
      intended to allow students to 'integrate' knowledge by drawing on several 
      disciplines as seniors.&nbsp; It created a College Honors program, which 
      granted credit for independent work for the first time.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in">&quot;Hinkle drove for 
      integration as well as that could be determined here at that time.&nbsp; That 
      mainly meant, I think, assuring that majors would take distributed 
      requirements in other areas.&nbsp; This now seems hardly more than tightening 
      the bolts on an already-built ship.&nbsp; At the time, however, the faculty and 
      administration were quite absorbed.&nbsp; The president and the dean worried 
      that new decisions would mean new expenditures.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Coming in as you did and working where 
      you did, you could not have had much influence on any of this,&quot; said 
      Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I had none,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; &quot;But I was 
      able to support the innovations in a public way.&nbsp; I was aligned with the 
      forces for change.&nbsp; And that really did include DLH, no matter what doubts 
      he may have had about major alteration.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I wrote a piece on curriculum for the 
      magazine that had to attract some notice.&nbsp; I compared the Ursinus changes 
      with the reforms of general education proposed by Daniel Bell at Columbia, 
      in his <i>The Reforming of General Education</i><u>.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bell seemed 
      refreshing to me because his critique attacked the very education I had 
      received fifteen years before.&nbsp; The old system, even in graduate school, 
      emphasized the mastering of a body of knowledge.&nbsp; Faculty paid too little 
      attention to the assumptions and structure that made that particular body 
      of knowledge significant.&nbsp; Bell called for the study of the structure of a 
      discipline, the method of inquiry, how we study what we study.&nbsp; By the 
      mid-'60s, it was commonplace to talk about the exponential increase in 
      'knowledge.'&nbsp; Educators were recognizing the impossibility of knowing an 
      entire corpus.&nbsp; Bell acted for a whole generation when he turned away from 
      a received canon.&nbsp; He made sense to me when he sought to highlight the 
      grounds or basis for putting that canon together.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger paused.&nbsp; &quot;By the way,&quot; he said as 
      an aside, &quot;without knowing it at the time, Bell was softening up the 
      battlefield for the 'culture wars' that would break out more than a decade 
      later, under the pressure of cultural theory based on race, class, and 
      gender.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Margaret&nbsp; said, &quot;Thank you, Mr. Bell.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      She spoke as a younger feminist scholar in language studies.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bell's most attractive proposal,&quot; Bodger 
      recalled, &quot;called for 'third tier' senior courses.&nbsp; They would generalize 
      experiences in a discipline by examining one of four approaches--the 
      historical foundations of disciplines in a common field; the 
      presuppositions of methodology and philosophy of disciplines in a common 
      field; the application of several disciplines to common problems; 
      comparative studies, especially of non-western cultures.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our faculty were using the term 
      'integration' as a sort of mantra, without giving much reflection about 
      its mechanics, how it would work conceptually.&nbsp; Bell provided such 
      reflection in his third-tier concept.&nbsp; So I compared it with our proposed 
      new senior symposium.&nbsp; That grafted a conscious intent onto our modest 
      initiative and made it look more significant than it probably was.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No matter,&quot; Margaret said.&nbsp; &quot;Your 
      comparison in print would have put you into the campus conversation.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes.&nbsp; Also, from the start I was in 
      fund-raising.&nbsp; That's what the alumni job was about, when all was said and 
      done.&nbsp; I naively thought that a good cause like ours would naturally 
      attract alumni support just by defining the needs clearly.&nbsp; With editorial 
      and promotional gimcrackery, I injected a newly strident tone into 
      Helfferich's development plans.&nbsp; The centennial anniversary of the college 
      would take place in 1969.&nbsp; He wanted to go out with a bang in the 100th 
      year.&nbsp; He saw his final years as a dramatic spectacle.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One day we sat in his office with a map 
      of the campus.&nbsp; Pointing with his well-chewed pipe stem, he specified the 
      sites of the buildings he wanted to build before he retired.&nbsp; He wanted a 
      new library in the center of the campus, on the exact spot of the 'old 
      main' building dating back to 1848, Freeland Hall, with its dormitory 
      additions, Derr and Stine.&nbsp; He wanted two new men's dormitories to replace 
      the rooms in the 'old main,' a new athletic facility, new science 
      building, new chapel.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Many years later, I found a drawing in 
      an alumni magazine from 1918.&nbsp; It was a grand vision of the growth of the 
      campus dreamt up by the then president, George L. Omwake.&nbsp; It displayed 
      the basic form of the campus that Helfferich dictated to me decades 
      later.&nbsp; DLH told me that when he was a senior, president Omwake called him 
      into his office.&nbsp; 'Donald, you have worked hard in telling me how to run 
      the college in the last four years.&nbsp; I predict you will be back.'&nbsp; DLH 
      told that story with pleasure and pride.&nbsp; Indeed, he returned as the 
      youngest trustee in the history of the college.&nbsp; It was in 1927, only six 
      years after he graduated.&nbsp; Omwake had nine more years to serve as 
      president.&nbsp; I think DLH learned a basic lesson about apprenticeship and 
      mentorship in his relations with Dr. Omwake.&nbsp; That example, central to his 
      vision of his own life, must have been in his mind when he put me to his 
      uses in my first years here.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In any case, I gave him some stage props 
      and some script.&nbsp; Within months of my coming, we threw together an Alumni 
      Centennial Fund program that would last four years, into the 100th year.&nbsp; 
      We had the college mascot arriving by helicopter on the football field.&nbsp; 
      We had a logo showing Zack the Bear loping toward 1969 against a great 
      '100' in the background.&nbsp; We brought in the class agents and redefined 
      their volunteer duties.&nbsp; We pushed them to reach every classmate.&nbsp; We made 
      new charts of gifts and held them accountable as we had not before.&nbsp; We 
      created committees and I bugged the chairmen to perform.&nbsp; Helfferich's 
      die-hard alumni supporters reached out and recruited new supporters like 
      themselves.&nbsp; George Spohn, of the class of '42, came in to head up the 
      program.&nbsp; He was a super achiever with one of the Philadelphia-based oil 
      companies.&nbsp; I knew George's style, having just come from the corporate 
      environment.&nbsp; We could speak the same promotional language, and we went at 
      the game as if I were still at my old gas works job.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There was an obvious stylistic clash 
      between that alumni program and the academic culture.&nbsp; This had to have 
      been evident to my new faculty friends and familiar professors of student 
      days.&nbsp; They probably saw it as benign hokum.&nbsp; If it would help generate 
      the money they knew was needed to get the college out of its threadbare 
      tradition, then give Bodge the benefit of the doubt.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You represented hope?&quot; asked Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm sure the level of skepticism was 
      high:&nbsp; 'This too shall pass.&nbsp; Still, why not watch and see how much he can 
      do?&nbsp; --Maybe we'll get something from it.&nbsp; In any event, Bodge seems 
      unthreatening.&nbsp; At the least, indulge his boosterism.&nbsp; Moreover, he's in 
      with DLH anyway, so we may as well live with what he is doing for now.'&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You are not describing a noble road to 
      the presidency,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Even in small political games in 
      academia, noble tactics hardly count,&quot; Bodger replied.&nbsp; &quot;At the time, of 
      course, I didn't even know I was in a presidential game.&quot; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>Bodger was learning how board members 
      influenced events</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Can the board help me?&quot; Margaret asked 
      Bodger one day.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Is the dean still giving you trouble?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Not yet.&nbsp; But I think he will.&nbsp; Does the 
      board have a final say?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes,&quot; Bodger said.&nbsp; &quot;But it's not that 
      simple.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took Bodger some years to fix the 
      board in his understanding of the college.&nbsp; To the ebbing and flowing of 
      classes, the daily traffic of students and faculty, it seemed irrelevant.&nbsp; 
      Early on, he saw that the president mainly wanted affirmation from it--and 
      money.&nbsp; When it became directly involved in campus issues, he became 
      nervous about it.&nbsp; Yet Helfferich seemed to take seriously his routine 
      pronouncements to them about their relevance to the reputation and 
      advancement of the college.&nbsp; It was that that took time for Bodger to 
      understand.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;DLH sought advice,&quot; Bodger said to 
      Margaret.&nbsp; &quot;Of course, mainly he was seeking advice in the form of 
      approval for something he had already decided was right.&nbsp; A year or two 
      after my arrival, I scheduled a weekend meeting with an alumni group in 
      the Washington-Baltimore area.&nbsp; Tom Beddow, '36, and his wife, Virginia, 
      '37, were the leaders of the alumni group there.&nbsp; Tom was one of that 
      cohort of alums who graduated in the late 'thirties, fought World War II, 
      became professionally successful, and supported Helfferich in his effort 
      to make over the college.&nbsp; He was on campus for a board meeting and 
      offered to drive me to the weekend meeting and put me up at their home.&nbsp; 
      The trip down Route 95 in his big Oldsmobile felt in the end like another 
      job interview, friendly and supportive though it was.&nbsp; He wanted to know 
      what I thought about the chances for the college.&nbsp; How did I envision the 
      future?&nbsp; What would I do to make the college improve?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Lying in a strange bed that night, 
      unable to sleep, it hit me.&nbsp; DLH had seen to it that Tom would invite me 
      to ride with him.&nbsp; He had wanted Tom's opinion about me.&nbsp; It was one of my 
      clearest early insights on what a board member does in working with a 
      president.&nbsp; It was probably lucky for me that I was too green to see what 
      was going on at 65 miles an hour in that Oldsmobile until afterward.&nbsp; Tom 
      liked the unvarnished things I said to him, long on enthusiasm, short on 
      understanding.&nbsp; I am certain he told DLH so.&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Years later, when I became president, he 
      was among my steadiest supporters.&nbsp; Two years into my presidency, he put 
      the motion to liberalize student rules that rescued me from having a 
      fatally split board of directors.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Bedfellows, so to speak,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There was an old boy feeling.&nbsp; 
      Absolutely.&nbsp; I knew it from my corporate experience.&nbsp; My Army experience.&nbsp; 
      It felt familiar.&nbsp; Generationally, however, I was different from Tom as 
      well as DLH.&nbsp; Being younger, I lapped up their support, almost took it for 
      granted, it came so easily.&nbsp; I suppose I gave my quid pro quo.&nbsp; But I 
      never felt consciously that I was doing so.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Does that mean you were disloyal to the 
      old boy code?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger answered, &quot;A good question that I 
      can't answer well.&nbsp; For one thing, nobody ever spelled out the code in so 
      many words.&nbsp; Tom was not always in agreement with Helfferich.&nbsp; He faulted 
      the use of endowment funds to build buildings, something DL believed we 
      had to do to jump-start the capital improvement program.&nbsp; Sometimes DLH 
      talked about the alumni board members as if they were still students--he 
      knew them then, after all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Years later, I was guilty of the same 
      attitude toward some of my former students.&nbsp; So, even in the tightest 
      alliance between Helfferich and a board member, there was an edge.&nbsp; No one 
      could ever forget that the president held office at the pleasure of the 
      board.&nbsp; DLH acted like a patrician, even a prince, as if he were the 
      institution.&nbsp; But in tense moments, he let me see that that was a pose.&nbsp; 
      He knew the board had final authority, even if they exercised it gently, 
      or not at all, in deference to his judgment, or to his pride.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You absorbed that understanding from 
      him,&quot; said Margaret, following his line of thought.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And added to it in the relations I began 
      to build with individual board members,&quot; Bodger said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret asked, &quot;Was that part of the job 
      you had?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes and no.&nbsp; Yes, because as alumni 
      secretary I was supposed to cultivate the interest and support of as many 
      successful alums as I could.&nbsp; No, DLH did not tell me in so many words to 
      create a coalition of board members who would later support me for the 
      presidency.&nbsp; And I was not doing that at the start at all.&nbsp; Nothing was 
      further from my mind.&nbsp; Still, it turned out that the early bonds that I 
      built contributed essentially to my successful bid for office in 1976.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Was Beddow the main one?&quot; Margaret 
      asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One of them.&nbsp; My alumni position brought 
      me into natural contact with all of the board members who were alumni, and 
      a majority of them were alumni.&nbsp; That included the board president, 
      William Reimert, '24.&nbsp; He was head of the newspaper in Allentown, 
      Pennsylvania.&nbsp; When DLH gave me the responsibility for running the 
      centennial fund-raising program, I complained that I could not do 
      everything he asked me to do without some help.&nbsp; He was not receptive.&nbsp; I 
      got in the car and drove to Allentown to see Reimert without telling DLH.&nbsp; 
      He was a courtly, generous man.&nbsp; If there was such a thing as a German 
      Reformed culture, he was its flower.&nbsp; He had been born in China to 
      missionaries of the Reformed church.&nbsp; I think his father was killed there 
      in the Boxer Rebellion.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I told Reimert that I feared failure for 
      lack of help and did not want unfair blame. He listened sympathetically.&nbsp; 
      He assured me I would not be hung out to dry.&nbsp; When I told him DLH was 
      unaware of my visit, he told me not to worry.&nbsp; I was naive enough to think 
      that he would not have called DLH before my appointment to see what was 
      up.&nbsp; But I never knew.&nbsp; DLH never let on that he knew that I went to 
      Reimert behind his back.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And you never got your help?&quot; Margaret 
      asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I got it.&nbsp; I hired Lee Dickson as a 
      fund-raising consultant and others for publicity and alumni contacts and a 
      succession of people afterward.&nbsp; I know better now than I did then why 
      Reimert and others listened to me.&nbsp; I was young and full of energy and 
      willing to knock myself out for the cause.&nbsp; That didn't seem to me to 
      count for much, contrasted to my vast ignorance of what I had become 
      involved in.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Especially fund-raising.&nbsp; Dickson was 
      the toughest critic.&nbsp; He told me every day how mistaken I was in almost 
      every step I took in the fund-raising program.&nbsp; He was a kind of 
      monomaniac about fund-raising.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I learned from him in a year or so 
      lasted my whole career.&nbsp; He gave me the hardest lessons about 
      fund-raising.&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all, Dickson taught me that fund-raising is not 
      about money.&nbsp; It is about building allegiances to an institutional epic.&nbsp; 
      The money comes in after you have built a network of loyal advocates of 
      that epic.&nbsp; People of conscience would not violate their allegiance to the 
      institutional epic.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret said, &quot;It sounds as if your 
      ignorance was getting you somewhere.&quot; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now I can see how valuable youth is to 
      an organization, despite its vast ignorance.&nbsp; It is all that the 
      organization has to carry it into the future.&nbsp; I guess it's lucky that 
      most young people don't fully know their importance to the ongoingness of 
      the organization. It's lucky, too, that the seniors don't tell them the 
      secret.&nbsp; Otherwise, the young would demand more than they do.&nbsp; They're 
      insufferable enough sometimes.&nbsp; Certainly I was.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Do you have more to say about your 
      insufferability?&quot; Margaret probed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Maybe later.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Can I assume that somebody can be 
      insufferable and still be retained?&quot; she asked.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Living example,&quot; Bodger said as she 
      left, looking a little weary.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was alone, Bodger mused further 
      about administration-board relations.&nbsp; They divided into three parts.&nbsp; He 
      could identify each part with a person.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Heefner, '42, stood for 
      the innovative alums.&nbsp; Paul Guest, '38, stood for the traditionalist 
      alums.&nbsp; Bill Elliott stood for the non-alumni business supporters.&nbsp; 
      Bodger's adaptability enabled him to win the favor of all three parts.&nbsp; It 
      was not that he deliberately sought favor for future payoff.&nbsp; He simply 
      had learned in his US Army stint and in his corporate decade that it was 
      his job to get along with whatever powers there were.&nbsp; Right or wrong.&nbsp; 
      For the time being, anyway.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elliott presided over a small life 
      insurance company in Philadelphia.&nbsp; He also owned&nbsp; rural property near the 
      college, a productive dairy farm, complete with a retail store.&nbsp; Walebe's 
      farm-made ice cream was a highlight of the community.&nbsp; He served on the 
      board because of his personal loyalty to Helfferich, flavored with a pinch 
      of local <i>noblesse oblige</i>.&nbsp; He had little apparent interest in 
      liberal education as such.&nbsp; He reluctantly allowed his name to be used as 
      an honorary co-chairman of the capital campaign that came to be called the 
      All-College Anniversary Drive.&nbsp; Helfferich expected large dollars from him 
      in the end, and the pool at the new gym came to bear his name. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elliott knew that Bodger had worked for a 
      couple of years at Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company in 
      Philadelphia, a major-league competitor to his small but successful 
      company.&nbsp; Like other business people on the board, Elliott seemed to take 
      that past history as Bodger's seal of acceptability.&nbsp; He never knew the 
      cross currents of Bodger's loyalties and had no reason to want to.&nbsp; Bodger 
      was okay because he had business experience and because DLH said he was 
      okay.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guest apparently felt that way too. He 
      was an entrepreneurial attorney with an office on South Broad Street in 
      center city Philadelphia.&nbsp; He had piloted a B-17 bomber over Germany in 
      World War II.&nbsp; He was named the alumnus of the year in the year preceding 
      Bodger's start on the job.&nbsp; He was a co-founder of the alumni Loyalty 
      Fund.&nbsp; He loved the college he attended in the '30s, when order prevailed 
      and roles were clear.&nbsp; On social rules prohibiting dorm visits by members 
      of the opposite sex and the consumption of alcohol on campus, he was an 
      absolutist.&nbsp; The revolution in social behavior in the '60s to him was a 
      total calamity.&nbsp; It called for adamant resistance.&nbsp; Guest encouraged DLH 
      to hold the line against social changes for which students were constantly 
      agitating.&nbsp; He viewed the college as an extension of the church.&nbsp; He 
      expected the numerous clergy on the board to be his natural allies.&nbsp; This 
      was in spite of his concern that the clergy at times seemed willing to 
      legitimize the national <i>angst </i>over Vietnam and the rise of youth as 
      a moral force in the public arena.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guest seemed to like Bodger's aggressive 
      approach to fund-raising and his familiarity with the rhythms of the 
      city.&nbsp; As a leader of the capital campaign, he espoused Bodger, gave 
      advice and encouragement.&nbsp; They met in early morning sessions over 
      breakfast at the Union League, a short walk from Guest's South Broad 
      Street office.&nbsp; A friendly intimacy developed.&nbsp; Bodger appreciated the 
      affirmation he received from Guest.&nbsp; They both felt that they were 
      connected to the spirit of the institution and were working together for 
      its enhancement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guest, however, never stopped testing 
      Bodger's bearings on the social and academic policies of the college. As 
      one of the men who had passed favorable judgment on Bodger when he was a 
      candidate for his job, Guest had a serious personal investment in him.&nbsp; 
      Guest appeared to want to believe in him.&nbsp; But he was inquisitive where 
      Elliott was simply accepting.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was wary of waverers. Bodger was 
      sufficiently separated from decision-making on social and academic policy 
      in his apprentice years to preserve the trust of Guest.&nbsp; He admitted to 
      himself that he sometimes had to say less to Guest than he had on his mind 
      about the social upheavals of the late '60s in order to keep that trust.&nbsp; 
      A decade later, Bodger would reap the consequences of those omissions when 
      Guest opposed his recommendations for change in student life policy.&nbsp; But 
      that was only after he gave firm support to Bodger for the presidency.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Heefner came to the board in 1969, 
      well after Helfferich had confidentially tagged Bodger as a presidential 
      apprentice.&nbsp; He too was an attorney, busy building a major firm in Bucks 
      County.&nbsp; He too fought the war in Europe but on the ground in Italy.&nbsp; Like 
      Guest, he had the GI generation's commitment to goals and results.&nbsp; Like 
      Guest, he valued institutional loyalty and team play.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From their first meeting, however, Bodger 
      saw in Heefner someone with a different and more adventurous outlook.&nbsp; To 
      Guest, the challenge of change was to build a strong wall of resistance.&nbsp; 
      To Heefner, the challenge of change was to seize it and manage it.&nbsp; A 
      talented performer at the organ keyboard (he played for chapel during his 
      student years), he pursued his profession with a conscious sense of 
      style.&nbsp; He would do the expected thing, but he would do it his way.&nbsp; That 
      was true as well of his volunteer activity for the college.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger had met him for the first time in 
      his office in Morrisville.&nbsp; Bodger was there to ask him to become active 
      in the alumni association.&nbsp; Heefner was quick with a quip, and he agreed 
      to emcee the annual alumni luncheon--&quot;but only if I get to choose the 
      color scheme, the menu, and the flowers.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Agreed,&quot; Bodger had said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he did choose the color scheme for 
      the tablecloths and napkins, did review and modify the menu, and did order 
      the flowers for the tables.&nbsp; The meeting was a grand success.&nbsp; When Bodger 
      visited him again to debrief the day, Heefner told him to be careful of 
      involving him further.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If I'm involved, I want to be involved, 
      not used for show.&nbsp; I will want to lead things.&nbsp; I will push.&nbsp; This may 
      make you or your boss uncomfortable.&nbsp; So think before you ask for more.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here was someone he could work with, 
      Bodger said to himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; He came back to campus and urged the president 
      to approve Heefner as a candidate to run for election to the board by the 
      alumni association.&nbsp; His election to the board began a formal relationship 
      that would last until the end of Bodger's active service to the college.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      It also started a personal friendship that gave Bodger a steady pole 
      through the ups and downs of his years on the job and into retirement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heefner was in the heat of building his 
      law firm into one of the biggest in Bucks County.&nbsp; In addition, he was a 
      bank director, a leader in the state Democratic party, a mover and shaker 
      of cultural and historical organizations in the county and the state.&nbsp; He 
      played the organ at the local Lutheran church every Sunday.&nbsp;&nbsp; He molded 
      and shaped his spacious country place in Perkasie with the attention of an 
      artist.&nbsp; If there had been an American squirearchy, the charm of his 
      estate would have signified his leading place in it. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heefner seemed to sense Helfferich's 
      intentions toward Bodger from the start.&nbsp; He never deviated from his 
      posture of steadfast support for Bodger's advancement.&nbsp; When he became the 
      chairman of the Century II fund-raising program, which followed on the 
      heels of the All-College Anniversary Drive, he replaced Guest as Bodger's 
      regular companion at breakfast or lunch.&nbsp; They mapped the campaign with a 
      sense of fun and comradeship.&nbsp; He took a deliberate and intentional 
      approach to the prospect of Bodger becoming president.&nbsp; The campaign ran 
      from 1970 to 1975, the very years when Bodger was finishing his 
      preparations to be president.&nbsp; Heefner's voice therefore had a formative 
      influence on Bodger in his most malleable period.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the deliberations for Helfferich's 
      successor began in 1969, Heefner talked with Bodger one day at lunch.&nbsp; It 
      was before Bodger made a decision to remove himself from consideration.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.3in">Heefner said, &quot;If we want 
      your election to be the outcome, everything that you say, everything said 
      by those trying to bring it about, should be said with that outcome in 
      mind.&nbsp; By the time the board votes, their choice of you should be so 
      obvious to everyone that it will happen as if there were no alternative.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heefner was constitutionally disposed to
      <i>make</i> things happen.&nbsp; He was patient in the face of obstacles but 
      impatient when the sought-after goal could not be defined.&nbsp; He thought 
      that to make things happen, one had to have prescience.&nbsp; One had to have 
      the insight to know before the other people where events were tending.&nbsp; 
      Then one had to go to work.&nbsp; &quot;Going to work&quot; meant doing all the messy 
      things required by organizations to move people through the glue of fear 
      and ignorance.&nbsp; He took the long view on setting goals and the short-term, 
      nitty-gritty view on getting something done.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That combination, it turned out, 
      reinforced Bodger's own bent.&nbsp; He took confidence from Heefner.&nbsp; Bodger 
      sometimes felt that the dilemmas of the management of a college in the 
      heat of the late '60s were irreconcilable.&nbsp; He sometimes wondered how 
      Helfferich could balance contradictions on his shoulders with such 
      apparent aplomb.&nbsp; Heefner's attitude reassured Bodger.&nbsp; Heefner gradually 
      came to believe that conditions on the campus had to change and that they 
      would change for the better if the right things were said and done at 
      critical moments--and if the leadership had a destination in mind.&nbsp; This 
      was so even in the face of apparent intransigence from some board members 
      on some issues, especially social life and student freedoms.&nbsp;&nbsp; For Bodger, 
      Heefner became a trusted confidant.&nbsp; With discretion, he would listen to 
      Bodger's most outrageous diagnoses of current campus distress.&nbsp; As time 
      went on, more and more he also listened to Bodger's developing visions of 
      what the college might become. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the 1969-70 academic year grew longer, 
      the board's search for the president's replacement limped.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellwood 
      Paisley, of the class of '13, orchestrated it.&nbsp; Paisley was a&nbsp; retired 
      executive who now gave much of his time to his role as secretary of the 
      college&nbsp; board.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paisley perpetuated a family tradition of service to the 
      college.&nbsp; His father, a railroad vice president, had set a world record 
      for longevity as president of the college's board--54 years!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's incredible!&quot; Margaret said when 
      Bodger reviewed these events with her at their next cup of coffee at the 
      Hut.&nbsp; &quot;He couldn't have lived so long.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I never met the man,&quot; Bodger said, &quot;but 
      his name is on my undergraduate diploma.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ellwood was to the college born, then.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I count four generations.&nbsp; The Paisley 
      family figured large in the German Reformed Church in Philadelphia.&nbsp; 
      Ellwood was like Bill Reimert in that sense.&nbsp; The same gentility and 
      courtesy.&nbsp; He spent several days a week on the campus.&nbsp; He won the respect 
      of students and faculty on a 'concerns' committee, which he served as 
      secretary representing the board.&nbsp; He was a dapper little fellow, who 
      blossomed into colors and fashion after his retirement from business.&nbsp; He 
      modeled mature men's clothing in center city for the fun of it.&nbsp; He had a 
      sense of design, having apparently studied drafting in high school.&nbsp; He 
      created the shield of the college that appeared for decades on the 
      convocation program covers.&nbsp; His athletic emblem hangs in the gym over the 
      basketball court in Helfferich Hall.&nbsp; The students and faculty saw in him 
      the embodiment of the old college, a kind of mascot or cartoon.&nbsp; They were 
      benign in this perception.&nbsp; In the heated fights over social rules and 
      anti-war rallies, he was a walking symbol of civility and respect for 
      everyone.&nbsp; Helfferich was shrewd to put him front and center as the 
      visible representative of the board.&nbsp; He never spoke out on issues but 
      listened attentively to everyone.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But he ran a limp search process,&quot; said 
      Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He was under Helfferich's thumb, I 
      imagine. There were several candidates who appeared publicly on campus in 
      the fall or winter of 1969-1970.&nbsp;&nbsp; The public interviews were 
      uncoordinated.&nbsp; One candidate had to eat hot dogs for lunch because 
      Ellwood neglected to order a special luncheon in the president's dining 
      room. It almost seemed as if the search was supposed to fail.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In May 1970, with the field thinning to 
      virtually no viable candidates from outside, Ellwood made an appointment 
      to see me in my office.&nbsp; It became evident to me after a few minutes that 
      he had been coached by DLH.&nbsp; He reviewed the months of searching and said 
      that the arrow was now pointing inward at the campus, since the pool of 
      outside candidates had pretty well run dry.&nbsp; The last great hope had been 
      that Fred Binder, a seasoned college president who graduated in 1942, 
      would come back to alma mater.&nbsp; But a liberal arts college in California 
      made him an offer first and he took it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ellwood told me, 'Now, I'm here to tell 
      you that I will submit your name if you are willing.'&nbsp;&nbsp; This turn of 
      events did not seem quite real to me.&nbsp; Perhaps he did not think it was 
      completely real either.&nbsp; But he went on. 'As I see it, the next president 
      needs to be a good administrator, and you have shown how good you are as 
      an administrator.'&nbsp; I had been named v.p. for administrative affairs just 
      the year before.&nbsp; The dean had been named v.p. for academic affairs at the 
      same time.&nbsp; I protested.&nbsp; He went on. 'That would be the case I would make 
      for your candidacy.&nbsp; The committee has letters from several faculty 
      members, some students, and an administrator endorsing you.&nbsp; Would you be 
      interested?'</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You were, surely,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I had the good sense to defer my 
      response.&nbsp; I wrote him a note that evening and explained why I was not the 
      best qualified person.&nbsp; I said I would be willing to try anything they 
      wanted to try but in my judgment this was not the time for me.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;By the following month, the campus was a 
      bog of speculation and anticipation.&nbsp; The search committee had one more 
      outside candidate, who did not appear to be strong.&nbsp; The growing sentiment 
      among board members, I sensed, was that the college could not trust an 
      outsider to hold the line against student unrest.&nbsp; They wanted assurance 
      that the college would not follow Swarthmore and others into the headlines 
      about permissiveness and the violence that flowed from it.&nbsp; I indulged in 
      some secret play acting in my journal; I thought about the way I could 
      play at the role of conservative defender of the castle.&nbsp; It seemed like a 
      game, but the reality of the college's situation kept sobering me.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was at that point, in June, that DLH 
      finally confided in me.&nbsp; He told me it might come down to a choice between 
      the dean and me.&nbsp; The board would ask for his recommendation.&nbsp; 'In that 
      case,' he said, amusement on his face behind his cigarette, 'I will have a 
      trying half hour with myself.'&nbsp; I do not remember my response, but I am 
      sure it was an attempt, at least, at self-effacement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A few weeks earlier, he had broached the 
      subject with me without referring to our particular search.&nbsp; 'You're going 
      to be a college president in maybe two years or four--if not here, then 
      someplace else.'&nbsp; And then he gave me some advice on how to train Margot 
      for the job of president's wife!&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;O wow,&quot; said feminist Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was a different day,&quot; Bodger smiled.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;By mid-summer, they interviewed the only 
      remaining outside candidate.&nbsp; He was a genteel southern scholar of English 
      literature.&nbsp; Paul Guest was leading the discussion in the search 
      committee.&nbsp; He was increasingly emphatic that the person chosen would 
      control the students, or else.&nbsp; A southern gentleman just wouldn't cut the 
      mustard here.&nbsp; So, it was evident that the choice would be the dean, 
      another year in office for DL, or <i>moi</i>.&nbsp; I told myself that I would 
      not take the job if offered.&nbsp; I knew I would lack the clout to lead on my 
      own.&nbsp; Everyone would see that I was out in front as Helfferich's voice.&nbsp; I 
      knew that Guest's expectations were dominant in the board.&nbsp; It was clear 
      that I did not have it in me to conduct stone-walling tactics with 
      students and faculty of the kind he and others expected.&nbsp; What's more, I 
      felt that my lack of academic standing was a mortal handicap.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You're telling me this because you want 
      me to know that you were learning something useful for later,&quot; Margaret 
      said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;About boards of directors,&quot; said Bodger.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yourself too?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That too.&nbsp; Boards seem remote from the 
      classrooms.&nbsp; But they establish the tone and the framework in ways 
      mysterious to students and faculty.&nbsp; I was fortunate, as I look back on 
      it, to have been a target of their interest, a pawn, in a way, of their 
      moves to guide the place.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Heefner--wasn't he beating the drum for 
      you?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He was very new to the board.&nbsp; He didn't 
      presume to play a big part this time around.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Let me see,&quot; Margaret said.&nbsp; &quot;Five years 
      after you escaped from the chains of corporate conformity, after you were 
      adopted by Helfferich as a malleable talent, you came up to the starting 
      line but did not run.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In a nutshell,&quot; Bodger said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But life went on and you waited for the 
      next race.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Right again.&nbsp; 1976.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;By then you were ready.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No, but the board deemed I was ready.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The board,&quot; Margaret said.&nbsp; She returned 
      to her evaluation problems.&nbsp; &quot;Reassure me the dean can't get rid of me 
      without sensible people seeing that I'm worth keeping.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger replied, &quot;I think you're worth 
      keeping, but I may not be a sensible person.&nbsp; And I'm not involved now.&nbsp; 
      It depends how far toward decision the president has gone before he brings 
      a question like that to the board.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How can I influence that?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Keep on being an imaginative teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Keep on studying and involving your students in your study.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; 
      You have a couple of years before the tenure decision.&nbsp; Do you want to be 
      here?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I do.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Trust the gods a little bit.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They don't exist outside the board,&quot; she 
      said with an arch look.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well then....&quot; Bodger said as they left 
      the Hut.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>The Kennedys called for bearers of the burden</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The worries of the eating class,&quot; 
      Bodger said to himself.&nbsp; Raking through the first years of his service at 
      the college, he still could feel the constant pounding of anxiety.&nbsp; 
      Anxiety over nothing in particular and everything in general.&nbsp; The anxiety 
      of being in one's thirties, with two kids and a wife and a mortgage.&nbsp; The 
      anxiety of doing the bidding of a superior whose expectations often seemed 
      to go beyond sensible bounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; The anxiety of the insurmountability of 
      time.&nbsp; The unmet demands on him were so deep, so all-around, that he could 
      not look beyond the moment at hand.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point, though, anxiety modulated 
      into exhilaration.&nbsp; He knew the sheer pleasure of being pushed to the 
      limit of physical and psychic power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Helfferich's attention to his 
      performance reinforced his sense of self worth in strong if subconscious 
      ways.&nbsp; If he had known how to calibrate the anxiety, the fear of just 
      about everything, so that it sustained itself as exhilaration, his life 
      would have been euphoric.&nbsp; He was not that emotionally agile.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the main, he told himself, those first 
      years on the campus were the most exciting and the most exasperating of 
      his career.&nbsp; He had little perspective and no time.&nbsp;&nbsp; That compelled him 
      to reach for examples and resources already at hand when he started to 
      work at the college.&nbsp; For one, he privately looked to the slain John F. 
      Kennedy as an exemplar of style, of a manner of commitment.&nbsp; Kennedy was 
      of that older World War II generation in whose shadow Bodger, of the 
      younger Silent Generation, had grown up.&nbsp; Bodger saw in him, as in others 
      of that committed cohort, clarity of purpose and forthrightness of 
      action.&nbsp; Kennedy had the extra merit of putting himself into service with 
      high humor and quick imagination.&nbsp; There was a seeming selflessness about 
      his passage that appealed to Bodger, his rich-boy brazenness to the 
      contrary notwithstanding.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When war in Vietnam started to fill the 
      screen two years after JFK's bloody end, Bodger could feel the fading of 
      the romance and relevance of Kennedy, both in the life of the nation and 
      in his own life.&nbsp; But its trace lasted.&nbsp; By the time Robert Kennedy was 
      shot in 1968, Bodger was embroiled in his own small wars on the campus.&nbsp; 
      That doubtless made him more vulnerable to the emotions of that second 
      Kennedy death.&nbsp; It was as if it took Bobby's fall to move him beyond a 
      certain naivete about leadership--at that moment when he was moving and 
      being moved into a small-scale position of leadership himself.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ruminated on it in his journal of that 
      time.&nbsp; As he had done often in his ongoing conversations with Margaret and 
      Michael, he went to that on-again off-again archaeological dig.&nbsp; For 9 
      June 1968 he found he had written:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I have watched another 
      Kennedy go down to rest, I cannot fully believe it.&nbsp; I have the feeling 
      that tomorrow is planless, beyond control.&nbsp; The web of rational public 
      conflict is destroyed.&nbsp; The nation is dangling, subject to whims and 
      powers too erratic to allow hope.&nbsp; The madness of high places runs as a 
      constant through history.&nbsp; But the violent death of two Kennedys is a fact 
      for ME, for MY lifetime.&nbsp; It is my personal tragedy, history be damned.&nbsp; 
      These were the flesh of my times.&nbsp; They held out some hope for an adequate 
      response to the needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; They ended up powerless.&nbsp; The promise, the poise, 
      the passion, the desire, the dreams, the drive: Bobby, like John, was 
      close to Camus's existential man--pushing his rock for all he was worth, 
      and damn the consequences, even the irrelevance of it.&nbsp; It was all Bobby 
      could do: he had his 'special responsibility'--not just toward Jack's 
      memory, one suspects, but toward himself most of all.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Ironic that these jet-age Medicis 
      act out their tragedy in the forms of the old Christian institution before 
      the eyes of millions via TV.&nbsp; Here they speak of Bobby with the angels at 
      his side.&nbsp; Far from smiling, they pray solemnly as Bernstein conducts 
      Mahler's 5th symphony!&nbsp; When the fallen is a prince, one need not strive 
      for petty consistency.&nbsp; The very richness and variety of the mix of 
      style--the combination of rhetorics--comes close to the heart of the 
      Kennedy charisma: a going off madly in several directions, but with a 
      quiet and simple stability at the center.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them be hated if that is the price 
      we have to pay for leaders who will speak out.&nbsp; The hate cannot hurt them 
      now, anyway.&nbsp; They stood up and stood out.&nbsp; It's something to be a man of 
      courage, even if it kills you and leaves the survivors to doubt.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I take a private vow to try to prove 
      what both Kennedys sought to prove: a man can affect this society for the 
      better.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps that's the only way to dispel 
      the disillusion, to make a personal decision in spite of one's feelings.&nbsp; 
      To shrug at this moment is to die.&nbsp; To study 'the problem of violence' 
      sociologically now is to count angels on bullet casings.&nbsp; Let Milton 
      Eisenhower's commission call for a three-act tragedy from Edward Albee, 
      Arthur Miller, or Tennessee Williams--and then all go home and meditate on 
      the depravity of humankind...on the ritual means required for hemming in 
      or transforming rage and revenge.&nbsp; The Kennedys deserve better than a 
      beady-eyed analysis.&nbsp; Let the nation at least give back what they gave.&nbsp; 
      Art.&nbsp; An American Odyssey.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger was seeking a private 
      expression for a public event.&nbsp; It did not matter then, or now, that it 
      risked crossing the border of bathos.&nbsp; Three decades later, he was trying 
      to calculate what made him go on to become president of a small 
      principality.&nbsp; The terrible events of the '60s at the highest places of 
      power became a solution in which he was able to bathe his own motives.&nbsp; He 
      could see that now.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We will bear any burden,&quot;&nbsp; JFK said at 
      his inauguration.&nbsp; Bodger would serve, come whatever.&nbsp; He would serve 
      where he could, where chance had put him.&nbsp; It was lucky, he reflected, 
      that he had kept this rhetorical extravagance within the confines of his 
      private journal.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<b><u>The board finally chose a new president</u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      &quot;And finally,&quot; he told Margaret, &quot;there was a letter to my ten-year-old 
      daughter.&nbsp; Of course, she never received it.&nbsp; Even to this day.&nbsp; It was in 
      June 1970.&nbsp; The search process was losing all its steam.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He handed her the pages of lined, yellow 
      tablet paper.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Read them at your leisure,&quot; he said.&nbsp; At 
      home, later, in her study, she read the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dear Kar:</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of Anouilh's Joan of Arc, in
      </i>The Lark<i>.&nbsp; Joan advised the timorous king to be afraid as he had 
      never been afraid before.&nbsp; She said, 'You say, one thing is obvious, I'm 
      frightened, which is nobody's business but mine, and now on I go.'</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;So, Kar, I'm frightened of the whole 
      crisis of leadership.&nbsp; So what's new?&nbsp; Now on I go with the business.&nbsp; 
      Please guard my secret--that I'm scared to death, and to hell with it.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strunk advised his composition 
      students at Dartmouth College, when they knew they were about to make a 
      mistake in speaking, to SAY IT LOUD.&nbsp; Maybe that's the way to purge the 
      squeamies too: when you know you are afraid, look your fear right in the 
      eye and howl like hell.&nbsp; OK.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will know, if you look in my 
      private journal, that I have been sneaking sips of fantasy about 
      presidential leadership for more than two years--long before the problem 
      reached its present crisis, long before I was anything more than a mere 
      dabbler in organizational dynamics, ironic-uncommitted intelligence 
      hanging on the ambivalences of the 'fifties like a free and occasionally 
      panicky chimpanzee.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet not unadulterated fantasy.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there wasn't any doubt that 
      the Helfferich era would move toward a climax.&nbsp; There was a small reason 
      for me to think that, over and beyond all the waves of feeling and all the 
      intellectual ambivalences, I had a core of something that was brute and 
      stubborn enough to endure.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENDURANCE: A certain final 
      imperviousness to the erosive emotions that lead you by the nose.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I came to understand it was that final 
      imperviousness that made it possible for my old boss at the Gas Works, 
      Charlie Simpson, to come to the top from the ranks.&nbsp; It was the same thing 
      that enabled D. L. Helfferich to absorb and dissolve contradictions of 
      thought and attitude that would have disabled other men.&nbsp; I knew quick 
      wits counted.&nbsp; I knew you had to have a fatalistic sense that each turn of 
      the organizational wheel may crush you.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leadership, I realized, was a 
      mysterious contradiction.&nbsp; It was at once a willingness to risk everything 
      and a pathological determination to hold everything together.&nbsp; But 
      Endurance counted most.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not unadulterated fantasy--BUT CLOSE 
      to being that.&nbsp; How could a graduate school dropout presume to think 
      seriously of Presidencies?&nbsp; Someone who plied the most superficial 
      conventions of corporate PR, a marketable hack, lacking fibre for 
      sustained creative performance?</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crisis is simple.&nbsp; Helfferich has 
      publicized his retirement.&nbsp; There is no replacement.&nbsp; The board's search 
      committee has been looking for more than a year.&nbsp; If there were good 
      candidates, they have slipped away through maladroit committee work or a 
      darker motive rooted in the parochial soul of the place.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With no one in sight, attention has 
      turned toward me.&nbsp; I am popular with various segments of the campus partly 
      because the president and dean have been willing to take blame for 
      unpopular decisions.&nbsp; I have been cast in the role of conciliator, friend 
      of students, reasonable colleague.&nbsp; The director of the play has been D. 
      L. Helfferich.&nbsp; Few know they have been watching his play.&nbsp; They think I 
      can BE as well as PLAY those characters.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The board will be wiser in its 
      judgment, I hope.&nbsp; Too young and untried.&nbsp; Too ambitious.&nbsp; Too sympathetic 
      to some of the ideas of some faculty members.&nbsp; Too lenient with students.&nbsp; 
      Yet also, the ghost who wrote THE college speech of our times, the 
      notorious Franklin Institute speech on the philosophic temper of the 
      college.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Today the president told me he has 
      all but given up on the faculty.&nbsp; He decries their self-centeredness.&nbsp; 
      First, they are watching out for number one.&nbsp; Second, they are watching 
      out for their disciplines--how can each get more courses, more professors, 
      fewer teaching hours, better offices?&nbsp; Third, they are watching out for 
      nothing else at all.&nbsp; Certainly not for the goal of sensitizing students 
      for a moral and ethical mission in life.&nbsp; They do not acknowledge the 
      primacy of the board's role in deciding on a philosophical commitment for 
      the institution.&nbsp; The president said these things more in sorrow than in 
      anger.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Kar, students are busy busy 
      busy.&nbsp; Reading about the free university.&nbsp; Asserting the rights of 
      students to have a say in the decision-making process.&nbsp; Determining their 
      life-style their way, no thanks to the college.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the focal point of these 
      conflicting lines of force is the hot seat in the president's office.&nbsp; 
      With enough time, one perhaps could study the problems and produce a 
      document that would resolve the conflicts of ideas.&nbsp; There is no time.&nbsp; 
      One makes do.&nbsp; Hoping that those who don't agree will agree to continue 
      speaking to each other.&nbsp; Hoping that the creative tension will not 
      increase and become transformed into a destructive tension.&nbsp; Despairing, 
      finally, at settling the thing suitably for all.&nbsp; But knowing there might 
      be a moment, a blessed point of rest, when at least in one's own mind, 
      each force is counterpoised to every other force in a harmony of 
      conflict.&nbsp; At that point, anyone mad enough to be a president might be 
      wise enough to quit, effective at once, and hurry away to the hills to 
      write his personal memoirs.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does seem to be a personal matter 
      at bottom.&nbsp; We have the crisis because the shadow of a man has been so 
      long that no one believed it would really withdraw.&nbsp; Now people know.&nbsp; It 
      is late.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conflict of outlooks, the 
      conflicts of definitions have been held in constructive tension because 
      they have been played along the nerve ends of a single man.</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Larkian panic derives not from lack 
      of will to decide issues.&nbsp; Rather, I doubt the suppleness of my nerve 
      ends.&nbsp; Could they sustain that kind of electrical charge for very long?&nbsp; 
      Those nerve ends sensitized early by admiration for Stevenson, conditioned 
      by </i>New Republic<i> rhetoric, Henry Miller exuberance, the arcane 
      godmanship of Alan Watts?&nbsp; Tuned into non-verbal communication, 
      half-persuaded by the merman of the tube, McLuhan, fascinated by the 
      indeterminate universe of Gully Jimson: can I be guardian of a 
      conservative temperament?&nbsp; Or, can I turn an entire board and college 
      around?&nbsp; Gas Works man?&nbsp; Publicist?&nbsp; Word tinkerer?&nbsp; Pied piper?&nbsp; Madman?</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, when this has been decided, 
      your nutty father had the sanity to laugh at it and himself.&nbsp; That's the 
      most serious thing I've said here.&quot;</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And so it did come down to a choice 
      between the dean and me,&quot; Bodger told Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And President Helfferich did have his 
      trying half hour with himself,&quot; said Margaret.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And he did make the prudent choice,&quot; 
      said Bodger.&nbsp; &quot;On 25 September 1970, the board met in special session to 
      elect William S. Pettit the next president, to take office on 1 November.&nbsp; 
      It elected D. L. Helfferich chancellor, a unique position without 
      portfolio.&nbsp; He was to watch over the comedy.&nbsp; To the degree that Pettit 
      and the rest of us were willing, the board expected Helfferich to see that 
      our play did not bomb.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day after the election, Bodger wrote 
      a letter of support to Pettit.&nbsp; He told DLH he was doing so and promised 
      him that he would do everything possible to help Pettit.&nbsp; DLH seemed 
      pleased with the sound of sincerity in Bodger's voice and told him that 
      Pettit would need all the help he could get from anyone at hand.&nbsp; Bodger 
      heard a voice in his head, saying, the institution is bigger than any of 
      us as individuals, and the office molds the man.&nbsp; He sensed that the next 
      years would call for Service and Duty in ways that he had not yet 
      fathomed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You must have played an acceptable part, 
      since you survived to run again,&quot; Margaret said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger said, &quot;I don't know how acceptable 
      it was.&nbsp; I did survive.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Margaret called on the phone a week 
      later, her anxious tone seemed to have faded.&nbsp; She was high, in fact.&nbsp; 
      Antoine had an offer at a liberal arts college in the south that he could 
      not refuse.&nbsp;&nbsp; The president and dean there liked the way he combined 
      ethnicity with his use of deconstructive tools.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You'll go back to living here alone,&quot; 
      Bodger probed.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'll go with him,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What will you do--for work?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I can edit, I can teach introductory 
      French as a part-time lecturer, I can tutor rich kids who lack language 
      skill....&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;You mean you'll go even if our dean says 
      you're okay?&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Outahere,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bodger saw her some days later and said 
      he would miss talking with her.&nbsp; He hoped his roaming around in his own 
      past had not burdened her.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I think I made you do it,&quot; she said.&nbsp; 
      &quot;You've taught me more than you know.&nbsp; Come hell or cranky deans, be 
      master of your own fate, captain of your soul.&nbsp; Even if you feel the 
      chains around your ankles.&nbsp; Even if it's not possible.&quot;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she turned to leave, she could 
      scarcely believe she heard Bodger say, &quot;Cool.&quot;</p>
