    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Spells represent a specific genre of folklore. It is characterised by
    very close relations with the archaic forms of national culture and the mythical outlook.
    Being directly connected with practical magic, spells are practised by a relatively small
    group of people. The verbal contents of spells is usually kept in secret, consequently,
    spells are subject to change to a lesser degree than the texts of other genres of
    folklore. In this respect spells can be regarded as a profound source of ancient
    tradition. A deep-rooted opinion that spell techniques cannot be revealed to anybody
    because this deprives spells of their power hinders the collection of texts. So, it is
    difficult to determine both the precise number of spells and the area of their
    distribution. It is only possible to speak about the registered and correspondingly
    processed texts. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maybe first hints about spells should be sought in the descriptions of
    mediaeval witch trials (see <i>Ragan� teismai Lietuvoje</i> (Witch trials in Lithuania).
    However until late 19th c. there had been no serious attempts to collect and examine
    Lithuanian spells. First modest collections of Lithuanian spells (with or without
    translation) could be occasionally found in the books by German and Polish authors (see <i>Bezzenberger;
    Wolter; Kraszewski</i>; also the Polish <i>Wisla</i> magazine publications teeming with
    spell descriptions since 1880). It was only at the beginning of the 20th c. that the first
    exhaustive collection of spells, that is a book by the Finnish researcher V. Mansikka
    appeared (see <i>Mansikka</i>). Though several spells were published earlier in the book
    by A. R. Niemi and A. Sabaliauskas (see <i>Niemi, Sabaliauskas</i>), Mansikka�s
    contribution into the research of Lithuanian spells could be hardy surpassed: V. Mansikka
    provided the most profound descriptions of spells. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later the boom of folklore collection started in Lithuania. The
    twenties and the thirties produced an exceptionally vast quantity of material. Various
    periodicals, such as <i>�Kosmos�, �M�s� tautosaka�, �Tauta ir �odis�,
    �Gimtasai kra�tas� , �Lietuvi� tauta�, �Mokykla ir gyvenimas�, ��vietimo
    darbas�, �Tautosakos darbai�</i> , etc. often published texts of spells. Among the
    authors who wrote about spells the following major ones could be mentioned: J. Elisonas
    (see <i>Elisonas</i>), V. Kr�v�-Mickevi�ius (see <i>Kr�v�-Mickevi�ius</i>), P.
    Stuk�nait�-Decikien� (see <i>Stuk�nait�; Stuk�nait�-Decikien�</i>). In the
    collection compiled by Stuk�nait�-Decikien�, Mansikka�s texts are repeated in several
    places, but otherwise the work is very interesting. Judging from literature published in
    those times, it is possible to conclude that the interest in this particular folklore
    genre, that is in the secret folk knowledge increased considerably: in the course of the
    two pre-war decades lots of folk magic descriptions appeared (see <i>Ma�iulis; Palukaitis</i>;
    <i>R�dzis; Mi�kinis; �imk�nas; Tumas</i>).</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the war collection and research of spells lost their vigour
    because of obvious reasons: such activities were forbidden and persecuted as was
    everything connected with the obscure side of life. Nevertheless, the biggest collection
    of Lithuanian spells was published at that time in America (see <i>Balys</i>). In 1968,
    the 5th volume of <i>�Lietuvi� tautosaka�</i> (Lithuanian folklore) series, that is <i>�Smulkioji</i>
    <i>tautosaka, �aidimai ir �okiai�</i> (Small-form folklore genres, games and dances),
    appeared in press. The volume included also the description of spells and divination
    practices. Besides, a lot of material was gathered during expeditions. This material has
    not yet been put in good order or processed duly. It is still resting in the entrails of
    manuscript depositories. The Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore and the
    Lithuanian Folklore Centre have just started the creation of a corresponding database. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is necessary to stress that the investigation into Lithuanian spells
    fostered a tremendous interest in the research of ancient religion and mythology. Compared
    to the tradition of neighbouring Slavs, Lithuanian spells have a more archaic structure.
    This is determined by historical reasons: due to a relatively late introduction of
    Christianity in Lithuania, Lithuanian folklore (spells, in the first place) managed to
    preserve certain characteristics of pagan outlook. For example, material relating to
    Lithuanian spells was used by V. Ivanov and V. Toporov to restore the basic Indo-European
    myth; it was also used in a number of other interesting studies of world outlook of
    ancient Balts and other nations (see <i>Ivanov; Toporov; Nevskaja; Dundulien�; V�lius</i>).
    </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A lot of information on the archaic understanding of the world can be
    revealed by the investigation into folklore texts, especially into Lithuanian spells. For
    example, almost all natural subjects found in them are personified: not only the Earth,
    the Fire, the Sun and the Moon but also the Oak and the Stone - that is the most important
    elements found in the centre of the mythic world - have their own spirit; they can
    actively engage in particular activities if asked to by a spell-binder: <i>Valiolio
    Dzievolio, per Dougio akmen�l�, per Bub� ��uol�l�, tavy pra�au, tau insakau -
    �odz� tark, kroj� sulaikyk, kad i� NN gysl� neb�gt�, d��ios i� k�no neviliot�.
    I�viliok geriou d��i� i� to med�io, kuris padzi�vo, i�laisk krouj�</i> <i>i� tos
    �ol�s, kuri�</i> <i>dalg� pakirto</i> (God, I am asking you, I am commanding you
    through Dougis the Stone and Bubis the Oak: utter the word, stop the blood from running
    out of NN�s veins, from tempting the soul out of the body. You better tempt the soul out
    of the tree that has become parched, you better let the blood out of the grass that has
    been cut by a scythe) (Kr�v�-Mickevi�ius. Kerai, p. 504, N III). Here the tree and the
    stone are characters with their own names; besides, a stone in Lithuanian spells also has
    its blood and breath (�<i>kvap� u��m�s</i>� (breathless). Such a view corresponds
    with ancient beliefs that everything in the world has its own spirit, that is an ability
    to act freely and independently. This can be said also about a human: he is not
    subordinate to the Supreme Being as is maintained by the Christian philosophy; a human not
    only settles his problems himself but is able to command even God (see the above-mentioned
    text). Traditional attributes of the God are just the instruments of the spell-binder: <i>Saul�s
    vardu, perk�no grousmu tau, drugy, insakou, tavi varou nog �moni�, nog gyvuli�, nog
    pouk��i�, nog kiekvieno gyvo garo... Jei many nepaklousysi, tavi saul�s spinduliu
    i�d�iovinsiu, saul�s kaitru nukamuosiu, gailiu rasu prigirdzysiu, u�ker�t�</i> <i>duonu
    pripen�siu</i> (In the name of the Sun, through the thunder of Perk�nas the Thunderer I
    command you, the Fever, I drive you away from people, animals, fowls, from every live
    property... If you do not obey, I shall dry you up with the ray of the Sun, I shall wear
    you out with the heat of the Sun, I shall make you drink the burning dew, I shall make you
    eat the enchanted bread) (Kr�v�-Mickevi�ius. Kerai, p. 507, N XVI); <i>�vento Petro
    raktu tavi rakinu, Dzievo vardu tavi u�keikiu</i>,<i> sustok</i> (I lock you by means of
    the key of St. Peter, I cast a spell on you, do stop) (LTR 3477 (146). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A spell-binder does not only cast a spell, speak or command, he himself
    fights actively against evil spirits. Action-denoting words used in spells perhaps reflect
    corresponding rituals relating to verbal magic: <i>trinu (dant� � dant�)</i> (I grind
    (tooth against tooth), <i>marinu</i> (I exterminate), <i>�aunu</i> ( I shoot), <i>kandu</i>
    (I bite), <i>grau�iu</i> (I gnaw), <i>kremtu</i> (I nibble), <i>ri�u</i> (I tie), <i>kertu
    </i>(I cut), <i>gnybu </i>(I pinch), <i>mezgu</i> (I bind), <i>rakinu </i>(I lock), <i>i�trinu</i>
    (I rub out ), <i>sutrasu</i> (I shake), <i>siuvu</i> (I sew), <i>i�imu</i> (I take out), <i>plaku
    </i>(I whip), <i>siun�iu </i>(I send), <i>nugenu</i> (I drive away), <i>varou</i> (I turn
    out). Not only a human being but also separate parts of his body can manifest their
    activity: spells reflect an opinion that a definite part of human body can cause illness,
    so a spell-binder asks that part of body to go back to its usual place, or threatens to
    punish it for misbehaviour: <i>A� �jau per �ali� giri� ir matau gil� �ulin�. A�
    tave noriu, tave, �t� dant�, noriu prigirdyt ir nugramzdinti, kad tu man daugiau</i>
    <i>nebeskaud�tum</i> (As I walked through the forest, I saw a deep well. I want to drawn
    you, the tooth, to send you to the bottom, so that you never ache again) (Balys, p. 67, N
    444); <i>Kaulelis, i��ok�s i� savo vietos, atgal kaul� � savo viet�, kur</i> <i>Dievs
    tave sutv�r�s</i> (You little displaced bone, go back to the place where God meant you
    to stay) (Balys, p. 73, N 479). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Christian tradition surely exercised influence on Lithuanian
    folklore. We can find vivid examples of such influence also in the texts of spells. But,
    in contrast to the Slavic tradition, here corresponding insertions sound artificial. They
    clearly do not fit in with the rest of the text: <i>A� dabar matau jaun� M�nul� ir
    kandu ant mano apmirusio danties. Vardan Dievo T�vo ir S�naus ir �ventosios Dvasios</i>
    (Now that I see waxing Moon (during its first quarter) I bite with my half-dead tooth. In
    the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit) (Balys, p. 23, N 83). <i>Kaip gumbas,
    taip klynas turi savo dvar�. I�sika�iok, i�sivaliok! Panele �ven�iausia, pristok,
    ponas Jezusis ir visi �vincieji, kaip akmuo undenin, taip gumbas zemyn. Amen.</i>
    (Stomach ache has its own realm. Smooth out yourself, roll out yourself! Holy Virgin, stay
    here for a while, and you, Jesus the Lord, and you, all saints, like a stone into the
    water so you, the stomach ache, get down. Amen). (Mansikka, p. 98, N 156). Extracts form
    popular prayers or the names of saints are usually inserted. The most important acts are
    performed either by the spell-binder himself or by other characters. There are also the
    texts describing actions performed by Christian characters (Jesus, Holy Virgin, and
    saints). The texts were possibly borrowed from neighbours who had correspondingly
    developed plots. Possibly, such characters just substituted pagan deities mentioned in
    primary texts. This is evidenced by analogous texts in which, for example, actions are
    performed by St. George (a more recent variant) or by <i>�vaistikas</i>, a pagan Baltic
    god (a primary variant). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is noteworthy that Lithuanian spells addressing pagan deities are
    very numerous. In them the Sun, the Moon, the Earth, the Fire (named Gabija) are often
    mentioned as separate independent characters. They are addressed not only in case of
    simple incantation against a disease (the Sun and the Earth are asked to �take away�
    venom; the Earth is responsible for the snake�s behaviour; the Moon �treats�
    toothache) but also in special prayers, for example: <i>M�nuo, M�nuo, M�nul�li,
    dangaus �viesus dievait�li, duok jam rat�, man sveikat�, duok jam pelnyst�, man</i> <i>Perk�no
    karalyst�</i>. (Moon the Bright God of the Heaven, give him a circle, give me health,
    give him completeness, give me the kingdom of Perk�nas the Thunderer). (Balys, p. 17, N
    1); [when burying fire under the ashes]: <i>Ugnele Gabijon�le, nekurstoma nedek,
    u�klostoma miegok</i> <i>ir nevaik��iok po �iuos namelius</i>. (<i>Gabijon�l�</i>
    the Fire, do not burn when not kindled, sleep under the cover, and do not walk about the
    house). (Balys, p. 48, N 302). Such prayers constitute a separate group of spells. Some
    researchers distinguish spells from the prayers of the above-mentioned type. We think this
    is not necessary because prayers and spells serve the same purpose: to protect a human
    from diseases, misfortunes, etc. Besides, the structure of prayers and spells is similar. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking of relations among spells and other folklore genres, it is
    necessary to stress the rhythmic form of certain spells. This makes them sound like little
    songs, for example: [during the storm]<i> Perk�ne dievaiti</i>, <i>nemu�k �emait�,
    mu�k gud� kaip �un� rud�!</i> (Perk�nas the God, do not strike a Samogitian, strike
    a Byelorussian like a ginger-haired dog!) (Balys, p. 53, N 355);</p>
    <i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Debes�li, pro �al�, pro �al�,<br>
    Nune�k gudo ver�el�, ver�el�, <br>
    � tatariui par�el�, par�el�, <br>
    � kunigo gsaidel�, gaid�l�,<br>
    � ubago mai�el�, mai�el�, <br>
    Dalykit�s per pus�, per pus�, <br>
    Viena pus� Saulelei, Saulelei, <br>
    Kita pus� debesiui, debesiui. </p>
    </i><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Cloud, go past, go past, take with you a Byelorussian�s calf, a
    Tartar�s piglet, a priest�s rooster, a beggar�s bag, divide the spoil equally
    between you two: one half for the Sun, one half for the Cloud). (Balys, p. 33, N 161).</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes it is even difficult to determine the genre of a certain
    text: whether the text represents a merry rhyme or is a part of a serious rite of
    enchantment. Texts of such type can be usually found in the so-called �non-serious�
    magic (for example, in magic acts aimed at influencing the weather). Incantations against
    disease are usually different. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Texts of spells are similar to legends or short stories. We have texts
    relating about a certain event, for example, somebody�s travel or meeting. Such texts
    usually take the form of a dialogue, for example: <i>J�zus Kristus �jo anksti ryt� su
    �v. Petru ir Panele �ven�iausia. Dievo gimdytoja �jo pirmiau j�. Marija paklaus�
    J�zaus: - Mano S�nau, kur mes einam? Kad �ia kelias eina kalnais, skard�iais ir per
    mi�kus. Taip apsaugok ir mano keli� nuo viso pikto. �ventas Petras i�trauk� savo
    raktus ir u�rakino vilk� gerkles, kad jie koj� neapgrau�t�, joki� nelaimi�
    nepadaryt� ir nuo</i> <i>kelio pab�gt�. Amen</i>. (Early in the morning, Jesus Christ
    went for a walk in the company of St. Peter and the Holy Virgin. The God�s Mother walked
    before them. Mary asked Jesus: - My Son, where are we going to? As here the path goes
    through the mountains, steep slopes and forests, so you protect my path from all evil. St.
    Peter took out his keys and locked the jaws of wolves lest they could pick the feet or
    bring about some misfortune; so that they run away from the path. Amen). (Balys, p. 89, N
    555). However such texts are not typical of Lithuanian tradition. Most probably they
    appeared later when Christianity had been firmly established, or, as a result of it, had
    undergone great changes. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Spells are directly connected with practical magic. In this respect
    they differ from other genres of folklore. When casting a spell, a spell-binder not only
    pronounces certain words but also performs various acts or uses ritual instruments.
    Surely, the spell-binder or magician himself or herself is the chief character of the
    ritual. The subject over whom the spell is cast - be it a human or an animal needing help
    - is just a passive witness of the ritual (very rarely he or she has to participate in the
    ritual in some way, for example, is asked to say a prayer). If the subject (a patient or
    an ill animal) is far away from the place of the ritual, the power of magic is transferred
    to him by means of a certain object. Various instruments can serve the purpose, but
    usually a magician casts a spell over bread, salt, water or other food that the patient is
    fed with later. Places that ache are covered with charmed butter, fat or honey. Wounds are
    treated by applying to them cold iron, rye flour, wool, and paper. (Such remedies have
    always been used for curing purposes). Knots can be tied on a piece of rope during the
    ritual in order to stop the wound, or an imaginary sewing up of a wound with a thread can
    be performed as is done in the following incantation against bleeding: <i>�Mezgu
    mazgel�, ne vien�, ne antr�, ne tre�i�, ne ketvirt�, ne penkt�, ne �e�t�, ne
    septint�, ne a�tunt� tiktai devint�. Kaip �it� raik�tel� mazgiau mazgeliais, taip
    mazgau, ri�u tave, NN kraujas...�</i> (I am tying a knot, not the first, not the
    second, not the third, not the fourth, not the fifth, not the sixth, not the seventh, not
    the eighth, I am tying the ninth. As I have tied knots on this band so I am tying up you,
    the blood of NN...). (Kr�v�-Mickevi�ius. Kerai, p. 504, N IV). It is necessary to
    stress that tying up as well as sewing up or knotting together have their sacral meaning.
    The process of tying is magic. It is interesting that the words �to sew�, �to
    tie�, and �to knot� also mean �to speak�. This indicates that the words �a
    knot� or �a thread� have their secret meaning. They denote �a strong word, speech,
    and magic� which fully answers their function in spells. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Word itself is equally powerful in spells. If uttered correctly or
    pronounced by a powerful character, it may become a strong weapon, for example: <i>Griaud�ia
    griausmas, �aibai �aibuoja, krenta r�dys, �aidai byra, dievo �od�io niekas negal
    pergal�t... </i>(Thunder is thundering, lightning is flashing, rust is falling down,
    sparks are flying, nothing can overcome the word of God...) (Mansikka, p. 103, N 181).
    Somebody�s name is a word of special importance: if you know your enemy�s name you can
    defeat him or her; and vice versa: if you mention the names of powerful characters, you
    can make use of their power, for example: <i>A� vis� vardus �inau, n� vienos nebijau:
    ar juodoji, ar margoji, ar varin�</i> <i>trejos</i> <i>devynerios</i>. (I know the names
    of them all, I am not afraid of any of them: be it the black one, be it the spotted one,
    or the copper-coloured one three times nine). (Balys, p. 56, N 382); ...<i> Per Dievo
    vard� pagalbes</i> <i>tegul pamo�yja Onai Ma�eikienei</i>. (...through the God�s name
    may Ona Ma�eikien� be helped). (LTR 4921 (17). Name carries the internal essence of the
    character. No wonder various taboos against the revelation of name exist: if you know a
    person�s name, you can destroy him/her or demand his/her help; in any case you can
    control the owner of the name. The victim�s (patient�s) name is to be mentioned in
    every incantation. The name is the main distinctive feature of it. (If incantation is
    uttered on behalf of an animal, the colour of its coat is to be mentioned). As soon as the
    spell-binder utters the name, the joint power of all forces is turned in the favourable
    direction. The name of the spell-binder himself/herself is also very important, for
    example:</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">�vinta Marija, pristok (Holy Mary, stay a while) (to be repeated 3
    times)<br>
    Plauk� ilgauodeg� par mares (The long-tailed one swam across the sea) (to be repeated 3
    times)<br>
    �vinta Marija nemiega (Holy Mary is not sleeping) (to be repeated 3 times)<br>
    Juodas plaukas nemiega (The black hair is not sleeping) (to be repeated 3 times)<br>
    Mano vardas nemiega (My name is not sleeping) (to be repeated 3 times). (LTR 3863). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secret power of the word is stressed also by a secret and discreet
    ritual of casting a spell: incantations had to be uttered in a low voice, in a whisper,
    and quickly (without pausing for breath) so that nobody (even the person on whose behalf
    the incantation is uttered) could understand anything. Only a person with healthy teeth
    was able to utter incantations so that the word (and breath) released by him/her could not
    be mutilated. Word was related with breathing: having uttered the incantation the magician
    had to blow softly on the object or wound on which the spell was being cast (as if sending
    out the words pronounced by him/her). It was extremely difficult to utter the whole text
    without stopping for breath, especially if the text had to be repeated several times (3,
    9, 12 or sometimes 27 times!). So, the spell-binder had to have not only good teeth but
    also good lungs. Besides, only the oldest or the youngest member of the family could
    become a spell-binder. A spell-binder was allowed to hand down his/her powers only to
    somebody who was younger than he/her or whose gender was the same as his/her. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The time and the place of the ritual was special: spells used to be
    cast usually at dawn or at sunset, within or without the house (depending on the purpose).
    Spells used to be suited to some important ritual moment, for example, sowing, sending the
    cattle to grass for the first time in spring, or kindling a fire. In such cases spells are
    similar to short prayers, that is a genre close to them. For example: [In spring when
    driving the cattle off to the pasture for the first time, it is necessary to walk in a
    circle around your herd three times a twig of <i>kemalas</i> in hand, then turn to the
    East and repeat the following three times:] <i>�ventas Jurgi, vilkus pa�abok, �ituos
    gyvulius saugok. Neskirk vilku nei karv�s, nei kioul�s, nei par�uko, nei teliuko, nei
    ma�o �riuko. Laisk vilkam gaudzic cik ki�kius, lapias, mi�ko �v�ris</i>. (St.
    George, bridle the wolves, protect these animals. Do not give the wolf either a cow, or a
    pig, or a piglet, or a calf, or a small lamb. Let the wolves be after rabbits, foxes and
    other forest animals). (Kr�v�-Mickevi�ius. Kerai, p. 508, N XIX); <i>�emyn�le,
    �iedk�l�le, �yd�k rugiais, kvie�iais, mie�iais ir visais javais, b�ki linksma,
    dievel, ant m�s�; [kad] prie t� m�s� darb� �vents angelas pristot�; pikt� �mog�
    pro �al� nukreipk, kad m�s� neapjuokt�. </i>(<i>�emyna</i> the Raiser of Flowers,
    bring yourself forth through the blooming rye, wheat, barley and all corn, show us your
    mirth, o Goddess; [so that] Holy Angel may stay with us while we perform our works; turn
    an evil human away from us so that he or she may not ridicule us). (Balys, p. 53, N 360). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Incantations against a snake bite are very numerous in Lithuania. Not
    only the urgency of magic measures (there are many snakes in Lithuania) but also the
    importance of the snake�s role in folk culture accounts for their popularity.
    Incantations against snakes reflect the existence of the cult of snake. Incantations
    against diseases, especially against erysipelas (the rose) and blood, occupy a second
    place according to popularity. Wound stopping by means of magic acts can be explained by
    the frequency (because of various reasons) and obviousness of this phenomenon: everyone
    can see when blood stops running from the wound. Treatment of the rose can be explained
    not only by the above-mentioned obviousness but also by a very common view that it can be
    cured only by casting a spell. (People still believe it). It seems that the range of
    diseases cured by casting a spell covers all illnesses known to people. But in reality
    each tradition gives preference to one or other disease. For example, we have only several
    incantations against tuberculosis or evil eye in Lithuania, while in the neighbouring
    areas occupied by Slavs such incantations are very numerous. Besides, such Lithuanian
    incantations are obvious borrowings. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Besides incantations against diseases, there are household incantations
    in Lithuania. They are mostly related with agriculture. Spells relating to animal
    protection represent a separate group. Compared to the tradition of Eastern Slavs, the
    Lithuanian tradition is almost void of love magic. Maybe this can be accounted for by the
    fact that love magic is universally considered to be black, therefore the attitude of
    people towards it is more serious: love magic is practised less often; on the other hand,
    people are reticent about it. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the structure of text, Lithuanian spells can be grouped in
    the following way:</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) Charms: very short texts consisting of only 1-2 words (usually, an
    enumeration of things that can help in case of an illness; or an address to the disease
    itself, for example: <i>Saule, m�nuo, �e��lis...</i> (The sun, the moon, the
    shadow...) (TD, p. 179, N 447); <i>�eme, �emela </i>(The earth, ...) (Mansikka, p. 81 N
    79).</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) Comparisons built according to the principle: �A like/as B� ,
    for example: <i>Kaip �itas stalelis siud�iuv�s, teg� ir ana sud�i�sta</i> (Like this
    shrunken table, may it shrink) (LTR 3585 (413); <i>�da mane r�muo-r�muon�lis, kaip
    vilkas �ali� m�s�, kaip �uvis �ali� �uv�, kaip avis ramun�l�</i> (Heartburn
    eats me like a wolf eating raw meat, like a fish eating raw fish, like a sheep eating a
    camomile) (Mansikka, p. 100, N 168). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3) Direct address to a disease or its personification. It may have the
    form of a covenant, a request, an order, a wish, a threat, or a command to get out, for
    example: <i>Me�ka, me�ka, i�l�sk i� aki�! A� tau duosiu</i> <i>urban� medaus!</i>
    (Bear, Bear, get out of my eyes! I shall give you a jarful of honey!) (LTR 4511(363); <i>Ro�e,
    ro�e, tu i� kur atsiradai, tu ir pra�uk; ro�e, ro�e, i� kur tu atsiradai, ten ir
    pranyk</i>. (Rose, Rose, go thither whence you have come from; Rose, Rose, depart thither
    whence you have come from) (LKAG 70 (64).</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4) Address to outsider characters or powerful natural forces with a
    request or demand to help get rid of the disease, for example:<i> Unduo, unden�li,
    sustok, kur b�gi, kur susilaikai, nuo ryt� lig vakar� apsiprausi, ap�varini vingiuotas
    pakrantes, gelton� sm�l�, apiprausk mano s�n�</i> <i>Jon�</i> (Water, Water, you who
    run and pause, you who wash yourself from East to West, you who clean the winding banks
    and the yellow sands, stop and wash my son Jonas) (Dundulien�, Akys, p. 55); <i>Pele,
    pele, te</i> <i>(�ia) tau kaulinis (dantis), duok man gele�in� </i>(Mouse, Mouse, here
    is a bone tooth; take it and give me an iron tooth) (LT, p. 903, N 9332). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5) Acts performed by the spell-binder himself/herself (or with the help
    of other characters), for example: <i>�it� karpel� ri�u, �it� karpel�</i> <i>ri�u...</i>
    (I am tying up this wart, I am tying up this wart...) (LTR 4511 (359); <i>A� nugenu NN
    (vardas) nelabas dvasias, slegu�ius ir visa pikta su trim devyneriom galyb�m, su trim
    (devyneriais) angelais. I�dilsi, kaip del�ios M�nuo, sud�i�si, kaip liekno �vendr�</i>.
    (I am driving away evil spirits, nightmares and all that is evil from NN (name) with the
    help of three times nine powers, with the help of three (nine) angels. You shall wane like
    a crescent moon, you shall shrink like a reed in a marsh) (Balys, p. 81, N 525). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6) Addresses directed to God or saints expressing a request to help,
    for example: <i>Panela �ven�iausia, kadangi pamynei t� leduliel�, kurioj an viso
    pasaulio nor�jai praryt, pamink nuodus �itos leduliulos, kurioj inkando, rei�kia, tok�
    ir tok� gyvul� </i>(Holy Virgin, as you have trampled on the snake that wanted to devour
    the whole world, do trample on the venom of the snake that has bitten, so to say, some
    animal) (LTR 4325 (253); <i>�vintas Jokubai, atimk sopi nuo NN. Yra in dangaus dvi
    zvaigzdes</i> <i>seserys:</i> <i>viena Polia, kita Lidia </i>(St. Jacob, take away the
    pain from NN. There are two stars in the sky: one is called Polia, the other is called
    Lidia) (Mansikka, p. 90, N 118). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7) Descriptions of acts made by saints, for example: <i>Panele
    �vin�iausia, ana Mariut�, ana �egnojo savo �vintu runkeli, ligas</i> <i>pavietrius</i>
    <i>sutabdin�jo</i> (Holy Virgin, Mary, she would cross by her holy hand, she would stop
    illnesses and diseases) (Stuk�nait�-Decikien�, p. 136, N 104); <i>Tur�jo Ponas Jezusis
    penkias ronas ir u�gijos. Kaip tos</i> <i>ronos u�gijos,</i> <i>kad taip u�gyt ir �ia</i>
    (Lord Jesus had five wounds, and all of them healed up. Like the wounds that healed up, so
    may this wound heal up) (Mansikka, p. 72, N 36). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also mixed texts. However, comparisons, addresses to
    diseases, and acts performed by the spell-binder himself/herself prevail. Probably these
    are the most archaic spells. They are static, that is the action described in them takes
    place without any specification of place and time, or, in other words, �here and now�.
    This fully answers the purpose of casting a spell: being closely related with the ritual
    act they themselves perform an act within a word. Longer incantations with a more
    elaborate plot (usually epic, and widespread in the Slavic tradition) are dynamic: they
    give an account of somebody�s travel; as Christian characters are common in them, this
    may indicate that such texts developed relatively later. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Usually, the purpose of casting a spell does not determine the type of
    spell. For example, incantations against a snake can be of any type. However there are
    strategic preferences in the treatment of one or other disease. For example, incantations
    against the rose usually belong to the 7th type, that is a description of a travel taken
    by a powerful character and his/her manipulations with the metaphor of the disease (that
    is with the flower of rose) are given; in incantations against blood, a comparison between
    blood and the Jordan in which the flow of water ceased (or was stopped by Jesus) is made;
    incantations against heartburn represent just a list of comparisons; incantations against <i>gri�ius</i>
    (aching joints) are dominated by a dialogue. Possibly such distribution is connected with
    the circumstance that every disease had its own most effective way of treatment. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The analysis of each of the above-mentioned variants revealed that the
    expected effect was supposed to rest on the widely-known principle of similarity (similar
    treats similar): sometimes a disease was likened to an outwardly similar thing (for
    example, blood - river), sometimes the same was done on the grounds of similar
    manifestation (for example, heartburn gnawing like an animal), sometimes - on the basis of
    similar sounding of the word (for example, rose (a disease) was likened to rose (a
    flower), sometimes a parallel was drawn between <i>gry�ius</i> (a disease) and <i>grau�imas</i>
    (gnawing). If the use of the principle of similarity did not work, then the spell-binder
    tried to establish a personal contact with the disease, that is he/she addressed it
    directly. Such method was common in incantations against a snake, a dog, and <i>gumbas</i>
    (stomach ache). Address directed to third persons was usually used in difficult cases when
    the spell-binder lacked self-confidence. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though spell casting techniques may differ, all texts share common
    structure. By this specific structure spells can be distinguished from other folklore
    texts. As almost all such texts purpose to restore the system of the world disturbed by
    diseases or other misfortunes, or to create a closed circle (as is done during a magic
    rite), this attempt can be observed also in the structural elements of the text. For
    example, in the repetition of sentences, words or even sounds: <i>A�ua�adu nuo
    kirm�l�s baltam arkliui. Neken�ia tav�s saul�, neken�ia tav�s m�nuo, neken�ia
    tav�s �vaig�d�s, neken�ia tav�s dangus, neken�ia tav�s pati, neken�ia tav�s
    vyras, neken�ia tav�s vaikai, neken�ia tav�s visa pamilija, ir</i> <i>a� tav�s
    neken�iu. Amen, amen, amen</i> (I am uttering the words against a worm for a white horse.
    The sun hates you, the moon hates you, the stars hate you, the sky hates you, the wife
    hates you, the husband hates you, the children hate you, the whole family hates you, and I
    hate you. Amen, amen, amen) (Mansikka, p. 77, N 59); <u><i>Saul� saule, m�nuo</i> <i>m�nesiu,
    �em� �eme, up� upe</u>! Nueik tu, gyvate, skradu �eme!</i> (LT, p. 895, N 9283); <i><u>Grau�
    gry�i�</u>, da<u> grau� geriau</u></i> (Mansikka, p. 96, N. 148). The formation of an
    orderly image of the world can be also observed in the description of various objects: <i>Pauk�tis
    be pieno, akmuo</i> <i>be sparn�, vanduo be kraujo </i>(A bird without milk, a stone
    without wings, water without blood) (Mansikka, p. 81, N. 75). Objects are to form a
    harmonised whole. Sometimes this harmony may seem absolutely illogical. However here we
    encounter another logic, that is the logic of the magic world. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such absurd representation can be explained by another principle of
    spell magic, that is by the building of a reverse world model. In it, like in a mirror,
    the image of the real world is reflected. Surely, in the reverse world things are also
    interrelated. Consequently, they can exchange their places, or be likened to anything. No
    wonder that sometimes things seem to go against the principles of logic. For example, the
    illogical order of objects exists in the following incantation against a snake: <i>�ema
    �emynela, un pirkel�s upel�, un tos upel�s</i> <i>aniolas �vintasai </i>(<i>�ema</i>
    <i>�emynela</i>, a river on the hut, a holy angel on the river) (Mansikka, p. 80, N 72).
    It is possible that here certain characteristics of human thinking, namely the associative
    relation among antipodal and distant objects manifests itself. Such a reverse world model
    can be distinguished also in the structure of the text: even the words can be read in
    reverse order, for example: <i>Te, va, gi, da, jo, da, ru. du, var, nia, vel, skie, ku,
    nie, na, ma, Jonas [= Gyvate, juoda, ruda! vardu velnio</i> - <i>nek�skit mano Jono!]</i>
    (= Snake, black and brown! in the name of Devil - do not bite my Jonas!) (Mansikka, p. 77,
    N 58). It is interesting that in this text the only �normal� word is the name of the
    snake�s victim. As can be seen, objects belonging to �this� world are not turned
    upside down. That is, they remain unchanged. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chief purpose of a spell is not only to describe the magic world,
    or to put its constituent parts in good order. Spell also purposes to perform a definite
    act, namely to strike a blow. Therefore many texts are similar to a blow in terms of their
    outward characteristics, such as compression, curtness and precision. Sometimes even verbs
    are omitted, for example: <i>D�iovinto v�jo, pernyk��io sniego, �i� met� ledo,
    rup���s kraujo</i> (Parched wind, last year�s snow, this year�s ice, toad�s
    blood) (LTR 4035 (15); <i>Dangus Jezau, saul� Jezau, �em� Jezau, rasa Jezau</i>. <i>Amen
    Jezau Kristau</i> (The heaven, O Jesus, the sun, O Jesus, the earth, O Jesus, the dew, O
    Jesus. Amen, O Jesus Christ) (Mansikka, p. 82, N 82). Such expressive compression is
    characteristic of Lithuanian spells. In this respect they can be likened to a blow struck
    from the centre. (Contrary to the spells of East Slavs characterised by a search for the
    above-mentioned centre). In Lithuanian spells the centre is represented by a spell-casting
    human who can achieve his aim - to tie up blood, to gnaw up <i>gry�ius</i> (disease), to
    enter into an agreement with evil spirits, even to kill by means of a thunderbolt if
    needed - all by himself without any external help. The prevalence of nominatives in
    Lithuanian spells evidences once more their archaic character: it is commonly known that
    in human phylogeny the part of cortex responsible for nominatives was formed relatively
    early. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Characteristic features of Lithuanian spells described in this article
    are closely related with the problem of borrowings. It is obvious that various traditions
    share common plots. For example, the motif of rose can be found in German and other
    European spells. (It is not so common among Slavs). Certain plots (for example, a
    comparison between blood and the Jordan) may have been borrowed owing to the Christian
    influence. However there are universal methods of treatment reflecting, perhaps, common
    characteristics of human thinking. Probably, such universal methods represent the likening
    of herpes to a bough, the asking of a mouse to provide good teeth, etc. However every
    tradition prefers certain plots to other ones. By the distribution of such preferred and,
    therefore, highly elaborated plots we can form an opinion about borrowings. For example,
    Lithuanian texts �against <i>lamanina</i> (rheumatics)� or �against evil eye� are
    created according to a traditional Slavic scheme, consequently, they must have been
    borrowed. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes separate borrowed words in Lithuanian texts betray the route
    by which the borrowing arrived. If we pay attention to the vocabulary of Lithuanian
    spells, we shall see many Slavisms. This is quite understandable, bearing in mind the
    linguistic situation and close contacts between the nations throughout the historical
    times. However the most interesting thing is that the most important words used in spells,
    that is the names of diseases or addresses to diseases, such as: <i>Gumbas,<u>
    apsistanavyj</u>!</i> (Stomach ache, do stop!) (Stuk�nait�-Decikien�, p. 130, N 56); <i>Mumine
    �emine, Atimk savo<u> zjadus</u>, Atduok margai karvei sveikat�</i> (<i>Mumin�</i> <i>�emin�,</i>
    take back your venom, give back good health to the spotted cow) (LKAG 207 (46, 48); <i>�venta
    Gabija, b�k <u>spakaini</u> </i>(Holy <i>Gabija</i> the Fire, be calm) (Balys, p. 47, N
    299) are non-Lithuanian words. Maybe every culture regards a foreign nation or a foreign
    language as a dangerous and unusual phenomenon. It is interesting that in our case foreign
    language is also considered to be more effective in the fight against the world of evil
    forces, or even in the maintaining of closer relations with it. The belief that a foreign
    obscure word is more helpful than a clear native word determines the appearance of quite
    unintelligible texts. They are formed of mispronounced or misunderstood texts of foreign
    languages (usually Polish or Russian). Because of the same reasons equivalent texts
    repeated in several languages appeared, for example: <i>Viespato Jezus per jura plauke
    jura nustojo teketo, kad ir mano kraujas nustota tekete. Gospodz J. czerez more plyl more
    pierestalo tem cztoby I moja krow pierestala tecz.</i> (Jesus the Lord swam across the
    sea, and the sea stopped flowing; oh, that my blood would stop running) (LMD I 942 (16). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bearing in mind the situation at the Lithuanian border, it is
    interesting to note that it is this area that abounds in spells possibly related with the
    basic dichotomy of the archaic man�s outlook, namely the �one�s own - alien�
    dichotomy. �One�s own� culture surrounded by alien environment is to be able to
    protect itself from unknown and therefore dangerous world. </p>
    <p>In the territory of Lithuania, there are many texts of spells created by other nations,
    mostly by Poles and Russians. In some regions bilingual spell-binders can cast spells in
    several languages. However the genesis of such texts and the influence of translation on
    different traditions can be revealed only by means of a research into the cultures of
    nations living there. At present the folklore of Russian Old Believers residing in
    Lithuania is gathered actively (see published texts of spells - <i>Novikovas, Trimakas</i>).
    Maybe this material will help us answer the above-mentioned questions, or will invite a
    lot of new ones. </p>
