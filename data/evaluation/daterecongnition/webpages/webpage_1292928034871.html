<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/bluelines.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Bluelines">Marthastewart.com has a new blog called <A HREF="http://blogs1.marthastewart.com/blueprint/">Bluelines</A>. The blog is a personal style blog that was <A HREF="http://media.prnewswire.com/en/jsp/search.jsp?searchtype=full&option=headlines&criteriadisplay=show&resourceid=3416143">launched</A> for Martha Stewart Living's <I>Blueprint</I> magazine. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
With its third issue, Blueprint: Design Your Life, the newest lifestyle magazine from the creators of Martha Stewart Living, is introducing Bluelines, a daily blog today. In our need-to-know-it-now age, this blog is an immediate and essential extension of the new, bimonthly periodical, Blueprint. Bluelines features fun finds, favorite sources, inspiring ideas, and clever shortcuts for women ages 25-39 who are interested in creating and refining their own personal style. The Blueprint blog is part of the launch of the blueprintmag.com website, which links to marthastewart.com.
<BR><BR>
"Bluelines adds another exciting dimension to Blueprint. Readers are constantly looking for new ideas and the Blueprint editors are thrilled to share their latest and greatest discoveries with them on a daily basis -- from our favorite online handyman who will tell you how to fix anything to the new oversized tote the entire fashion department is ordering. Now our readers can enjoy an instant fix online along with the sumptuous, in-depth experience they get when reading the magazine," said Blueprint Editor-in-Chief Sarah Humphreys.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/marthasvideos.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Marthas Videos">MarthaStewart.com also has a couple other blogs mentioned <A HREF="http://blogs1.marthastewart.com/">here</A>. They include <A HREF="http://blogs1.marthastewart.com/homegrown/">Homegrown Gardening</A>, a blog written by Andrew Beckman and Margaret Roach. There is also a blog by Dawna Stone called <A HREF="http://blogs1.marthastewart.com/apprentice/">Being Martha's Apprentice</A>, which describes Stone's job as Director of Development for  <I>Body+Soul</I> magazine. However, the Apprentice blog hasn't been updated since 2006. But there may be more blogs on the way. The site says, "In upcoming months we will be adding more blogs; check back regularly to see our new offerings." While they don't have many blogs yet on MarthaStewart.com they have added a video library that includes how-to videos. There is no embedding feature for the videos -- they can only viewed on Martha's website.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/sonybmg.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Sony BMG">News.com <A HREF="http://news.com.com/Sony+to+musicians+Think+blogs,+not+demo+CDs/2100-1027_3-6172257.html">reports</A> that SonyBMG will no longer accept hard copy demo submissions starting on Monday. Instead, Sony wants musicians to blog about themselves and their music on two sites: <A HREF="http://www.columbiademos.co.uk/">www.columbiademos.co.uk</A> or <A HREF="http://www.rcademos.co.uk/">www.rcademos.co.uk</A>. Both of the sites are part of a collaboration with Six Apart's <A HREF="http://www.vox.com/">Vox</A>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Instead, budding musicians will be asked to sign up on a record label Web site such as www.columbiademos.co.uk or www.rcademos.co.uk to blog their music, photos and videos.
<BR><BR>
"Blogging is clearly one of the major trends in music, media and entertainment," said Sony BMG's U.K. and Ireland Music Entertainment Chairman and Chief Executive Ged Doherty.
<BR><BR>
"A hundred thousand new blogs go online each day at the moment, and the blogosphere is doubling every 230 days, so it makes complete sense for the major labels to use the process in a creative way to encourage, discover and communicate with new artists," he said.
<BR><BR>
The move echoes strategies used by start-ups such as Amsterdam-based Sellaband and San Francisco-based social-networking site Bebo to attract talent and get artists known quickly to a fast-growing audience. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article1588288.ece">Times of London</A> calls it SonyBMG's plan to reinvent itself.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
From Monday the next Arctic Monkeys must upload a video or MP3 audio package to a new SonyBMG website where it will be assessed by label bosses and any musician or fan who chooses to log on at columbiademos.co.uk or rcademos.co.uk.
<BR><BR>
The change is necessary because Mr Doherty does not believe that recorded music, overall, will recover. "Digital sales are not going to make up the decline in physical CD revenue," he says. "By 2010 income from CDs will be down 50 per cent. The old world is gone for ever.
<BR><BR>
"We need to enter into a new relationship with our artists, where they see us as partners rather than the enemy." The demo blogs are designed to create an open, transparent access point for musicians.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
There are a couple of interesting things in the <A HREF="http://demosfaq.vox.com/">Demo Faq</A>. In this excerpt from the faq they explain why they are using blogs.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
<LI>Blogging is one of the major trends in music, media and entertainment, and we think it's about time that a major record label uses the new medium to find and communicate with new artists
<LI>We want to offer all those artists out there a new, efficient way of presenting yourself to our label's A&R managers, and using blogs for this purpose will be drastically easier for all involved parties.
<LI>Because we are open for submissions and conversations with interested artists, and the market-place, in general.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
It also sounds like they will check with blogging peers to measure the interest in the music before offering a deal.

Venturebeat has an <A HREF="http://venturebeat.com/2007/03/30/look-at-facebook/">article</A> on Facebook and it looks like strong growth is continues on the social network. Facebook is claiming 1.5 billion daily pageviews and 20 million registered users. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Facebook tells us the site is seeing about 1.5 billion page views a day, up from about 1 billion daily views last month - statistics that haven't been released until now. That's a huge jump.
<BR><BR>
First, myself and non-college friends appear to be getting more unsolicited invites from others - including those not in school - to connect on Facebook. Facebook is going mainstream.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Facebook's user and traffic growth is impressive but the Venturebeat article also looks like at Facebook's API called <A HREF="http://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook Developers</A> that could provide additional growth for the company.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
But there�s an undercurrent of development happening, suggesting Facebook may be seeing serious momentum in other ways. It's old news that Facebook opened its application programming interface last year, which lets software developers outside Facebook build other applications on top of Facebook's platform and data. The open project is called the Facebook Platform. But Facebook�s growth over the past several months, and improvement to its API policy, deserve attention.
<BR><BR>
Imagine Facebook user profiles and networks everywhere. In a suite of office software. In an online classroom. In a family's entertainment system. In whatever application developers choose to connect with.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Facebook users are going to have to not mind that their data is pulled out for use in other applications but so far that doesn't appear to be a problem. Venturebeat's article also lists several companies looking to use data and/or build applications from Facebook including <A HREF="http://www.mosoto.com">Mosoto</A>, <A HREF="http://www.slide.com">Slide</A>, <A HREF="http://www.jobster.com">Jobster</A> and <A HREF="https://auctomatic.com/">Auctomatic</A>.

Soyapi Mumba has an <A HREF="http://soyapi.blogspot.com/2007/03/potential-of-twitter-in-africa.html">interesting post</A> (hat tip <A HREF="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/03/30/twits-and-wits-malawian-bloggers-on-new-technologies-nature-myths-zimbabwe-and-a-hard-work-ethic/">Global Voices Online</A>) about the future of Twitter in Africa.  Twitter has the potential to be very big in African countries because many more people there have cell phones than computers with Internet access. Soyapi Mumba is blogging from Lilongwe, Malawi.  You can see where that is located <A HREF="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=Lilongwe%2C%20Malawi&btnG=Google+Search&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wl">here</A> on Google Maps</A>. Soyapi says that in Malawi there are about 700,000 mobile phone users but just 50,000 Internet users.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
So the launching of Twitter provides a good alternative considering that the use of mobile phones is much higher than that of computers. In Malawi for example, there are about 50,000 Internet users against about 700,000 mobile phone users out of a population of about 12 million. Twitter allows users to post a small update via SMS, instant messaging client and the web. Anyone who chooses to follow you will get that update on the Twitter home page, or their mobile phone of they choose to. Unlike most mobile phone web services, you can update via SMS from anywhere in the world and from virtually any handset.
<BR><BR>
Although Twitter was designed to let users announce what they're doing at the time of posting, we have already seen other uses coming up. The train system in San Fransisco (BART) uses Twitter to announce changes in schedules; conference participants use it to post notes of the sessions at the conference and there are updates from news companies like BBC via Twitter.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Soyapi also listed some uses for Twitter in Africa such as news, gossip, keeping up with family, soccer scores, political campaigns and notes from religious services.

A <I>Fortune</I> <A HREF="http://money.cnn.com/2007/03/27/magazines/fortune/fastforward_photobucket.fortune/">article</A> on CNN/Money says Photobucket has 38 million members and they are adding over 80,000 each day. Photobucket CEO Alex Welch told <I>Fortune</I> that the site is fad-proof because Photobucket is where social networking members store their graphics and photographs and they continue to use the photo storage service even they migrate to other social networks.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
There is a secret sauce here -- once somebody has stored their photo somewhere they will guard it zealously. Their online social life, so built around images, depends on it. That is what excites CEO Welch. "We're fad-proof," he declares. "If one social networking site goes away and another comes up the user just moves, but their content stays with Photobucket." He tries hard not to compete with the sites where his users congregate, which he calls "the social edge." "We focus very much on not being a community," Welch explains. "We let the communities build around us."
<BR><BR>
A recent story on News.com tried to poke holes in the Photobucket, so to speak, by saying that "critics" claimed the business would be at risk if MySpace ever withdrew permission to host links there. But that's about as likely as MySpace simply ejecting members by the millions. If it prohibited their precious links it would face a user revolt.
<BR><BR>
But in fact the flexibility Photobucket gives users to shift their links to other sites does enable them to flee MySpace, something many teenagers have recently been doing as they migrated to Facebook, where security and control provisions are greater.
<BR><BR>
The real risk to Photobucket would be if the next hot social network were able to become popular while prohibiting linking from the outset. But given how users have learned to behave, that might be difficult to achieve. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Photobucket does have rivals in the storage business but they appear to be at the top of the pack based on a <A HREF="http://www.bloggersblog.com/cgi-bin/bloggersblog.pl?bblog=623061">report</A> last year that showed Photobucket had 44% of the marketshare. You can see lists of competitors <A HREF="http://www.listible.com/list/online-image-storage-and-sharing">here</A> and <A HREF="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web/Web_Applications/Photo_Sharing/">here</A>. TechCrunch has a <A HREF="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/29/how-much-is-photobucket-worth/">post</A> about how much Photobucket is worth. <A HREF="http://valleywag.com/tech/flipmeat/the-marketing-of-photobucket-248186.php">Valleywag</A> says Photobucket will probably be sold to News Corp.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/twitter.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Twitter"><A HREF="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</A> continues to be plagued by outages and periods of slowness. The popular microblogging service has been down this morning. Marshall Kirkpatrick <A HREF="http://marshallk.com/twitters-downtime">wonders</A> just how much bigger Twitter would already be if it wasn't for all the downtime. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
How much growth has Twitter lost because of all the time it's unavailable? I have never engaged in sustained use of a web app that is down this much - I can imagine large numbers of other people just walk away and never come back. Everybody says Evan Williams has struck gold in this wildly succesful new service - but I'm sure he knows there's a real risk of that never proving true do to constant service problems. Good luck to the Twitter folks - I sure wish the site was up!
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The folks at Twitter are constantly working on it but it must be difficult when the number of people trying to log on and sign up is growing faster than your ability to add new servers and increase the website's capacity. The growing mainstream press may also be helping to cripple Twitter's website. They've been featured on <A HREF="http://cbs5.com/video/?id=21973@kpix.dayport.com">CBS</A>, <A HREF="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1603637,00.html?cnn=yes">Time</A> and <A HREF="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_14/b4028052.htm">Businessweek</A> just this week. People have also been noticing other tweaks Twitter has made to reduce load on the service. Yesterday, we noted on our <A HREF="http://twitter.com/bloggersblog">Twitter microblog</A> (after <A HREF="http://twitter.com/steverubel">Steve Rubel</A> noted it) that Twitter had reduced the refresh rate on people's Twitter pages from every two minutes to every ten minutes. During the downtime Twitter fans may be forced to blog about today's news events -- like <A HREF="http://www.mediacynic.com/cgi-bin/mediacynic.pl?cynic=329071">Karl Rove's crazy rap</A> -- instead of Twittering about them.

<I>Editor & Publisher</I> <A HREF="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/pressingissues_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003564636">reports</A> that President George Bush cited some blogs posts from Iraqi bloggers in a speech as evidence the surge is going well. However, the blog posts President Bush cited turned out to be older posts that had been reprinted in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> earlier this month. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
So the bloggers weren't even talking about current conditions in Baghdad. That left it to Rajiv Chandrasekaran, former Baghdad bureau chief of The Washington Post -- and author of the heralded 2006 book "Imperial Life in the Emerald City" -- who appeared on MSNBC's "Countdown" tonight to debunk this idea of a newly-safe Baghdad. "I talk to Iraqis all the time," he said.
<BR><BR>
He revealed that there had been steady insurgent artillery shots falling in the supposedly safe "Green Zone" all week, at least two Americans had died there in recent days, and U.S. Embassy staff had been instructed, in a switch, to wear their protective vests outside at all times. He also disclosed that the embassy's pool, scene of much partying in the recent past, has now been declared off-limits to extended stays.
<BR><BR>
To back up his point that pulling out of Iraq would be a disaster, President Bush had said today, "They have bloggers in Baghdad, just like we've got here," in a speech to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.
<BR><BR>
Then he quoted two of them: "Displaced families are returning home, marketplaces are seeing more activity, stores that were long shuttered are now reopening. We feel safer about moving in the city now. Our people want to see this effort succeed."
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Editor & Publisher</I> also points out that both the bloggers were dentist brothers who had met President Bush in 2004. They also write a blog called <A HREF="http://iraqthemodel.blogspot.com/">IraqTheModel.com</A> that can be found on the conservative <A HREF="http://pajamasmedia.com/">Pajamas Media</A> blog network.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>
Only hours later did the White House reveal that the bloggers were brothers, Mohammed and Omar Fadhil, and these supposedly little-known average Joes had met Bush in the Oval Office in 2004. They are dentists and write an English-language blog from Baghdad called IraqTheModel.com, also available via Pajamas Media. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Pajamas Media refers to the two Iraqi bloggers <A HREF="http://pajamasmedia.com/2007/03/president_bush_quotes_pjm_bagh.php">here</A> as the "illustrious Pajamas duo." The <I>Editor & Publisher</I> <A HREF="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/columns/pressingissues_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003564636">article</A> ends with two recent posts from the Fadhil brothers that are not upbeat about current the situation in Iraq.

Macworld <A HREF="http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/03/22/insurance/index.php">reports</A> (hat tip <A HREF="http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2007/03/27/insurance-co-blogs-are-a-liability">WebProNews</A>) that a law firm in New Jersey decided to hold off on setting up a blog after their insurance company told them the blog would not be covered under their malpractice insurance policy.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
James Paone, a partner at Lomurro, Davison, Eastman and Munoz in Freehold, N.J., said that the firm's insurer - The Chubb Corp. - said several weeks ago that it would not add the blog to the existing policy. "We were in the process of beginning to set up a blog, having internal discussions about what areas of law would be the subjects," he said. "We wanted to cover the first base, which is [Chubb's] coverage. Our insurance carrier said [a blog] is not a risk they were interested in insuring. The entire discussion stopped."
<BR><BR>
Paone said his firm contacted Chubb to ask about insurance coverage in case someone tried to sue it over content in the blog. Now, the law firm is in the process of setting up a meeting with Chubb "so we can understand what their rationale is for saying they weren't interested in covering that kind of risk," Paone said.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Chubb is a big publicly traded insurer so it surprising they appear to find blogs to risky to cover. They do have an <A HREF="http://www.chubb.com/businesses/csi/chubb912.html">Internet liability section</A> on their website. Lawyer and blogger Dennis Kennedy, who was quoted in the article, blogs about the issue <A HREF="http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2007/03/no_malpractice_insurance_for_law_firm_blogs.html">here</A>. Kennedy points out that lawyers have been using websites and phones for years and he doesn't think any new rules are needed for blogs. He also says, "My rule of thumb on these issues is to simply substitute the word 'telephone' for 'blog' and then see if there is any new issue raised by blogs that aren't raised by telephones."

The blog is called the <A HREF="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/">Deal Journal</A>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The new blog will be led by Mergers&Acquisitions reporter Dennis Berman and former Bloomberg reporter Dana Cimilluca. It will also incorporate reporting from Wall Street journal correspondents in New York, London and Hong Kong, as well as WSJ.com editors and Dow Jones Newswires private equity reporters.
<BR><BR>
The site is free for both journal subscribers and non-subscribers. In a press release, the paper billed the blog as "the centerpiece to an expanded arena of deals coverage by the Journal, with additional community tools, graphics and video to launch in coming months."
<BR><BR>
"Deal news itself is quickly commoditized on the Web," said Berman in a statement. "Where the Journal provides value is our insight, experience and intellect. Our collective observations on a given situation are what make all the difference -- and we hope to deliver a bit of humor and entertainment, too."

The Blog Herald also has a <A HREF="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/03/26/wall-street-journal-online-launches-deal-journal-blog">post</A> about the WSJ's new blog.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
There are three criteria that Sports Media Challenge use to rank blogs for the top 10 - Influence, Fan Engagement and Quality. These criteria combine quantitative aspects, including the number of incoming links that connect to the blog, number of fan comments as well as qualitative measurement by Sports Media Challenge analysts.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Sandra Gidley, the Liberal Democrat MP, hasn't posted since January 2006. In one of her last entries, she wrote, "I made a new year's resolution to resume the blog, but to be honest the beginning of the year was depressing" (Gidley was one of those who called for Charles Kennedy to go). Tory MP Theresa May hasn't posted since December, stating the obvious with the comment: "OK, so my previous promise to make my blogs more frequent may have fallen by the wayside."

Celebrity blogs are faring little better. "Oh my goodness, I am so sorry it has taken me so long to write!!" posts the actor Gillian Anderson in one of the last entries on her website in August last year, which shows she can't have been that sorry. Barbra Streisand's sideline in political commentary can't be dependent on keeping up the pressure - her last entry was four months ago. Some blogs, such as Mariah Carey's, in which she famously left rambling, incoherent messages before going into therapy, seem to have disappeared altogether.
<BR><BR>
"You have to be opinionated and passionate about what you write, or your enthusiasm will wane," says Drew Benvie, social media adviser for Lewis PR and a blogging expert. Benvie thinks now is the time to dig out your old password and get back to blogging. "Companies are starting to see them as a way of promoting their products. Write about films and you might get tickets to screenings; write about gadgets and you might be sent gadgets to test."
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
There is no question that many bloggers do not keep to a daily or even weekly schedule. Many blogs have probably also been abandoned over the past couple years. However, people still have plenty to say and love talking about themselves so the idea that blogging will go away completely is silly. What will happen is that blogging will peak at some point but there will always be networked communication and publishing tools that resembles blogging. The peak could literally be once every young person has some kind of profile somewhere. This seems like it is almost the case for the 13-21 year-olds. Tools like Flickr and Twitter and social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace also show that blogging can take a wide variety of forms: blogs, microblogs, photoblogs, social network profiles, etc. These variations on blogging will also make it very difficult to pinpoint exactly when blogging has peaked.

Kathy Sierra, who blogs at <A HREF="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</A>, has canceled her appearance and presentations at the eTech conference after receiving death threats. She explains some of the threats she received in <A HREF="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html">this post</A>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
As I type this, I am supposed to be in San Diego, delivering a workshop at the ETech conference. But I'm not. I'm at home, with the doors locked, terrified. For the last four weeks, I've been getting death threat comments on this blog. But that's not what pushed me over the edge. What finally did it was some disturbing threats of violence and sex posted on two other blogs... blogs authored and/or owned by a group that includes prominent bloggers. People you've probably heard of. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Kathy Sierra's post is currently the <A HREF="http://www.techmeme.com/070326/p72#a070326p72">lead story</A> on Techmeme and has over <A HREF="http://www.technorati.com/search/headrush.typepad.com%2Fcreating_passionate_users%2F2007%2F03%2Fas_i_type_this_.html">225 inbound links</A> according to Technorati. Some bloggers are talking about how <A HREF="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/03/misogyny_and_an.html">anonymity</A> can allow bad thoughts to be published. Climb to the Stairs has a <A HREF="http://climbtothestars.org/archives/2007/03/26/death-threats-in-the-blogosphere/">good roundup</A> of some of the blogs discussing the news.
<BR><BR>
Robert Scoble is also <A HREF="http://scobleizer.com/2007/03/26/taking-the-week-off/">very concerned</A> about the threats and is taking the week off.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
I'm physically ill after reading what happened to Kathy Sierra. Maryam and several others here at PodTech asked me about it and are concerned since the same sites that are attacking Kathy also mentioned me and Maryam. Maryam is really freaked out about it. So am I.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Scoble also writes about the snide comments that often appear in videos he posts that feature a female technologist.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
It's this culture of attacking women that has especially got to stop. I really don't care if you attack me. I take those attacks in stride. But, whenever I post a video of a female technologist there invariably are snide remarks about body parts and other things that simply wouldn't happen if the interviewee were a man.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
YouTube certainly has a lot of commments of that nature underneath some videos. Some of the blogs in the celebrity gossip category also contain numerous comments that would be considered demeaning toward women. Many of these are probably by people who are very young. These nasty comments are bad enough but it is another matter entirely when flame wars and insults escalate to the level of death threats. Hopefully, the people behind the threats will be dealt with and everyone can get back to blogging and feeling safe while they are doing it.

One very pessimistic article found <A HREF="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/business/story.asp?ID=181126">here</A> in the <I>Spokesman Review</I> asks, "Why is blogworld atwitter over Twitter?." They say Twitter may be one of this era's silliest fads.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
But the service of San Francisco-based Obvious Corp. might go down as one of the era's silliest fads, along with unreadable MySpace designs and blog widgets that display pictures of recent visitors.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
It also pokes fun at Twitter users.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
These deep thoughts leap into the world as blog posts � as well as text and instant messages to blather-stream subscribers. But it probably won't take many posts about midnight fridge raids and toenails ripping through socks for readers to conclude their Twitter pals are turning into twits.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
However, they do compare the talking about nothing aspect of Twitter to <I>Seinfeld</I>. They may have meant this to be a negative but <I>Seinfeld</I> was a very successful and long running tv show.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Remember the "Seinfeld" episode in which Jerry and George pitch NBC "a show about nothing"? At one point Costanza asks a network executive, "What did you do today?"
<BR><BR>
"I got up and came to work," the exec replies.
<BR><BR>
"There's a show!" George exclaims. "That's a show."
<BR><BR>
That's also a Twitter.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The latest estimates for Twitter's number of users is 80,000. The pessimists don't want to hear it but Twitter has probably already reached a point where it will continue growing exponentially even if some of the early adopters drop out. See <A HREF="http://www.atsweb.neu.edu/math/cp/blog/?id=15&month=04&year=2005&date=2005-04-25">this post</A> about exponential growth -- it analyzes the "Sniper Zero" episode from the show <I>Numb3rs</I>. Exponential growth is likely for Twitter providing they can continue adding enough servers and bandwidth to keep the service operating smoothly and providing they can add new features that make more users and publishers interested in Twitter.

<I>USA Today</I> has an <A HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/2007-03-15-podcast-directory_N.htm">article</A> about how people are using podcasts to learn more about some very specific topics like "Lectures on Byzantine emperors" and "Five-minute drills on grammar."
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
"The people are leading the charge into podcasting, and we don't take it for granted that all they want is American Idol," says Ron Bloom, CEO and co-founder of PodShow.com, a podcast network that offers links to 60,000 podcasts in 135 categories.
<BR><BR>
Podcasts with wide audiences are not so new; the president, the pope and even the Queen of England all have them. But an increasing slice of the podcast menu is more specialized and education-oriented.
<BR><BR>
One podcast tracking site lists nearly 1,300 podcasts in its education category out of a total of about 30,000 tracked; another lists more than 1,900 out of about 32,000. On iTunes, ground zero for the podcast universe, a dozen education-related podcasts regularly rank in the daily top 100 podcasts based on subscriptions.
<BR><BR>
"Almost any category you pick in podcasting is exploding," says Dave Hitt, a talk-show podcaster (Quick Hitts) who also helps run the Podcast Peer Awards, in which podcasters vote on the best in 16 categories. "Podcasting didn't exist 2&#189; years ago, so the number (of podcasts) has gone from zero to estimates of more than 50,000" in a short time.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

A long commute can be a great opportunity to learn something instead of just listening to the radio and being bombarded with commercials.

Paid Content is <A HREF="http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-idgs-infoworld-magazine-to-close-down-focus-on-online-events/">reporting</A> that IDG's <I>InfoWorld</I> is shuttering its print edition to focus on its events and <A HREF="http://infoworld.com/">website</A>. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Another storied print magazine is coming to an end in print, and the focus is shifting to online and events: InfoWorld, the weekly magazine owned by IDG, is closing down, and the announcement will come Monday morning, paidContent.org has confirmed. It was first reported in <A HREF="http://www.mediasurvey.com/index.php">MediaSurvey</A> premium newsletter here. InfoWorld has been a pioneer online and has been the earliest to embrace new techniques and forms of journalism and advertising, including blogging, podcasts, RSS (and ads in it), screencasting and others, so this move probably makes sense.
<BR><BR>
The worst thing: the staff internally didn't know about this until this story came out, and got picked up by <A HREF="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=19&entry_id=14710">SF Chronicle</A> and <A HREF="http://valleywag.com/tech/rumormonger/infoworld-to-fold-246793.php">Valleywag</A> among others. From what my sources told me, there won't be too many layoffs as most of the team had been working on multiplatform already: print, online and events. And don't discount the events side, as that was a major source of revenue for the brand. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Print titles closing while the websites survive is a growing trend. A few other recent titles include <A HREF="http://www.cracked.com/"><I>Cracked</I></A>, which will <A HREF="http://www.writenews.com/deadzone/deadzone.php?zone=302071">cease publishing</A> the recently relaunched print magazine but keep the website; <I>FHM USA</I>, a men's title that is also <A HREF="http://www.writenews.com/deadzone/deadzone.php?zone=104071">terminating</A> the print title but keeping the <A HREF="http://www.fhmonline.com/">website</A>; and <A HREF="http://www.premiere.com/"><I>Premiere</I></A>, which is <A HREF="http://www.writenews.com/deadzone/deadzone.php?zone=306071">shuttering its print title</A> but expanding its online website. 
<BR><BR>
The trend will probably mean growing competition for independent online websites and blogs as media companies with print magazines dump them to focus more on the Internet.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The topics are limitless and may range from counterfeit cigars to a new spirit on the market, to a memorable round of golf at a storied track.
<BR><BR>
The blogs are free for all to view, and subscribers to Cigar Insider can also submit posts and enjoy a direct dialogue with the editors.
<BR><BR>
"The blogs give the editors of Cigar Aficionado a unique opportunity to write on a variety of topics, not always about cigars and at times on a whim," said Marvin R. Shanken, editor and publisher of Cigar Aficionado. "They have been hugely popular with our sister site, WineSpectator.com and we are confident the same will be true for Cigar Aficionado."
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
As you might expect the blog posts discuss cigars. For example, James Suckling is <A HREF="http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Blogs/Blog_Detail/0,4695,36,00.html">surprised</A> by the strength of petit cigars and Gordon Mott <A HREF="http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Blogs/Blog_Detail/0,4695,34,00.html">remembers</A> his first great Cuban cigar.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
More than one in every eight children has been bullied by email or text message, psychologists have claimed.
<BR><BR>
The phenomenon - dubbed 'cyber-bullying' - is becoming more common, with girls most likely to be targeted.
<BR><BR>
A five-year survey of almost 15,227 children aged 11 to 13 found a steady increase in the number receiving nasty or threatening emails and texts.
<BR><BR>
Twenty-one per cent of girls were victims of cyber-bullying last year, while ten per cent of boys were victimised.
<BR><BR>
Fifteen per cent of pupils reported suffering harassment via text or the Internet.
<BR><BR>
The survey was carried out by psychologists Nathalie Noret of York St John University College and Ian Rivers, of Queen Margaret University College in Edinburgh.

<I>The Detroit News</I> is <A HREF="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007703220463">reporting</A> that a Michigan Catholic school called St. Hugo of the Hills Catholic School will no longer allow students that have MySpace profile to attend the school.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Students at a suburban Catholic school are being ordered to take down their photos, snappy comments, or anything else they may have posted on MySpace.com.
<BR><BR>
Friday is the deadline for students at St. Hugo of the Hills Catholic School to follow orders or risk suspension. School Principal Sister Margaret Van Velzen sent letters home to parents this week saying, in part, that if families allow children to continue their MySpace.com sites, they will not be allowed to return to school. The school plans to use its computer-savvy staff members to monitor the site for student activity.The principal declined comment, but St. Hugo office manager Judy Martinek said the principal just wants to keep the students safe.
<BR><BR>
"We've stated our position and we hope all students are in the process of taking down their sites by tomorrow," said Martinek.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
It may sound like a big overreaction to deny students access to the school just because they have a MySpace profile but this is what is happening. The article cites a country sheriff and a local parent who both agree with the school's decision. MySpace is not the only social network on the Internet so the ban won't even necessarily prevent the kids from using social networks. Still the ban may prevent naive high school students from posting stuff on a MySpace profile they may regret later when applying to college or trying to get a job.

The AP is <A HREF="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070321/tc_afp/malaysiamediainternetblogs">reporting</A> that Malaysia's Information Minister is telling people not to trust blogs.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Information Minister Zainuddin Maidin said most websites were aimed at being provocative and were run by frustrated journalists and political pundits, the Star daily reported.
<BR><BR>
"Do not quote them because you are disgracing yourself as you are the authority. Do not give credit to such anarchist websites," Zainuddin was quoted as saying.
<BR><BR>
Malaysia's media is kept under tight control, while blogs have seen an increase in popularity as Malaysians take to cyberspace to discuss politics and social issues.
<BR><BR>
Blogs run by Malaysians in recent months have alleged corruption by government figures in writings that later sparked mainstream news reports.
<BR><BR>
"The information posted on the blog website may be something provocative, politically motivated, inaccurate and is mostly rumour floated for the interests of certain parties," Zainuddin was quoted as saying by the state Bernama news agency.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The article says Malaysia's press is tightly controlled. This leaves blogs as the primary source of independent political thought and criticism of the government. This criticism clearly makes Malaysia's government unhappy.
Here in the U.S. the White House has had both <A HREF="http://www.bloggersblog.com/cgi-bin/bloggersblog.pl?bblog=301061">good and bad</A> things to say about blogs.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/newscorpnbcuniversal.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="News Corp and NBC Universal">
The <I>L.A. Times</I> is <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-youtube22mar22,0,326504.story">reporting</A> that <A HREF="http://www.newscorp.com/">News Corp.</A> and <A HREF="http://www.nbcuni.com/">NBC Universal</A> are teaming up to fight <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube.com</A>. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
News Corp. and NBC Universal plan to announce as soon as today that they are creating an online video site stocked with TV shows and movies, plus clips that users can modify and share with friends, according to people close to the negotiations.
<BR><BR>
The two companies enlisted help from some of Google's biggest Internet rivals. The News Corp.-NBC Universal partnership has deals with Yahoo Inc., Microsoft Corp., Time Warner Inc.'s AOL and News Corp.'s MySpace to place videos in front of their collective audience of hundreds of millions.
<BR><BR>
Despite Hollywood's dismal track record in creating successful joint ventures, these players see little choice but to band together to compete against Google and Apple Inc., which are becoming powerful distributors of entertainment.
<BR><BR>
News Corp. and NBC Universal want to control how their shows are watched online and to hold onto advertising dollars migrating to the Web. Google is expected to gobble up nearly a third of all online advertising revenue this year, according to research firm EMarketer Inc.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The <I>L.A. Times</I> article says there will be clips users can "share with friends." Hopefully, this means the site will have the technology that allows people to embed video clips and not just the "email this to a friend" kind of sharing. It will be difficult -- if not impossible -- for a new website to duplicate YouTube's traffic but if they offer embedding News Corp. and NBC Universal will still be able to benefit from the viral exposure their videos get when bloggers embed the clips in blog posts. Google also apparently has an internal nickname for the News Corp-NBC duo of <A HREF="http://newteevee.com/2007/03/22/clown-co/">Clown Co.</A> which probably won't go over very well with either News Corp. or NBC Universal.
<BR><BR>
<I>Update</I>
<BR><BR>
The <A HREF="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070322005690&newsLang=en">press release</A> for the deal lists AOL, MSN, MySpace and Yahoo! as distribution partners for the video website. This will obviously help drive traffic to the site. Here is a sample of the content that will be intially available.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At launch, full episodes and clips from current hit shows, including Heroes, 24, House, My Name Is Earl, Saturday Night Live, Friday Night Lights, The Riches, 30 Rock, The Simpsons, The Tonight Show, Prison Break, Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader and Top Chef, plus hits from the studios' vast television libraries, will be available free, on an ad-supported basis, within a rich consumer experience featuring personalized video playlists, mashups, online communities and video search. Plus, the extensive programming lineup will include fan favorite films like Borat, Little Miss Sunshine, Devil Wears Prada, The Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy with bonus materials and movie trailers. Post-launch, plans will be considered for acquiring additional content as well as producing and licensing original programming for the new site's audience.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The press release doesn't really make it clear the extent to which videos will be embeddable in blogs but it does suggest that MySpace users will be able to embed and share the video clips from the new website.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/snipurl.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Snipurl">A lot of people using <A HREF="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</A> are using <A HREF="http://www.tinyurl.com">Tinyurl.com</A> to shorten URLs. Tinyurl.com has held up very well under the heavy usage and the only observed downtime was very briefly earlier this morning.  Another option for shortening URLs is <A HREF="http://snipurl.com">SnipUrl</A>. SnipUrl has some useful features for people that register that Tinyurl doesn't currently offer. Here are some of the features.
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
<LI>View your snipped URLs
<LI>Edit your snipped URLs, including their nickname etc
<LI>Search through your snipped URLs
<LI>View popularity statistics on your own snipped URLs
</BLOCKQUOTE>
These tracking statistics are in addition to the Url shortening and redirection service. SnipUrl also allows you to change where the shortened URL points to later. You can read more about SnipUrl's features in their detailed <A HREF="http://snipurl.com/faq">Faq</A>. These features might be useful in Twitter where bloggers are constantly shortening URLs.

Google Operating System has a <A HREF="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/03/how-google-blog-search-ranks-results.html">very interesting post</A> about how <A HREF="http://blogsearch.google.com/">Google Blog Search</A> ranks search results. They found the information in a <A HREF="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220070061297%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20070061297&RS=DN/20070061297">patent</A> filed by Google. These are some of the positive things that can help your blog rank better in Google Blog Search.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
<LI>links from blogrolls (especially from high-quality blogrolls or blogrolls of "trusted bloggers")
<LI>links from other sources (mail, chats)
<LI>using tags to categorize a post
<LI>PageRank
<LI>the number of feed subscriptions (from feed readers)
<LI>clicks in search results
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The negative things that can hurt your blog's ranking in Google Blog Search are spam indicators like duplicated content, spammy keywords and adding posts at a predictable time. Having very few feed subscribers or no little on important blog rolls would also be a negative.
<BR><BR>
The <A HREF="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220070061297%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20070061297&RS=DN/20070061297">patent</A> itself is worth reading. Scroll down the part that says "Determining a Quality Score for a Blog Document." For example, Google does not just look at the number of feed subscribers. They also take a very close look at the number of individual feed subscribers in an attempt to help rule out spam blogs.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The popularity of the blog document may be a positive indication of the quality of that blog document. A number of news aggregator sites (commonly called "news readers" or "feed readers") exist where individuals can subscribe to a blog document (through its feed). Such aggregators store information describing how many individuals have subscribed to given blog documents. A blog document having a high number of subscriptions implies a higher quality for the blog document. Also, subscriptions can be validated against "subscriptions spam" (where spammers subscribe to their own blog documents in an attempt to make them "more popular") by validating unique users who subscribed, or by filtering unique Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the subscribers. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Google Operating System <A HREF="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/03/how-google-blog-search-ranks-results.html">says</A> Google develops a relevance score called an IR score to rank search results.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
To rank the search results, Google combines a quality score obtained by mixing those signals with a relevance score (IR score) that depends on the query. "The IR score may be determined based on the number of occurrences of the search terms in the document. The IR score may be determined based on where the search terms occur within the document (e.g., title, content, etc.) or characteristics of the search terms (e.g., font, size, color, etc.). A search term may be weighted differently from another search term when multiple search terms are present. The proximity of the search terms when multiple search terms are present may influence the IR score." (the quote was slightly altered for clarity)
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
If you can improve your inbound links and feed subscribers these are two things that will probably boost your blog's rank in Google Blog Search. A lot of times people are searching Google Blog Search for recent posts (which are sorted by date) so blogging frequently about current issues is also helpful.

CNET has an <A HREF="http://news.com.com/2100-1025_3-6168681.html">article</A> about the start of blogging that includes an interesting timeline on blogging. The article discusses several early bloggers including <A HREF="http://www.links.net/vita/web/story.html">Justin Hall</A>, <A HREF="http://diary.carolyn.org/">Carolyn Burke</A>, <A HREF="http://www.robotwisdom.com/">Jorn Barger</A> and <A HREF="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</A>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Was the first blogger the irascible Dave Winer? The iconoclastic Jorn Barger? Or was the first blogger really Justin Hall, a Web diarist and online gaming expert whom The New York Times Magazine once called the "founding father of personal blogging"?
<BR><BR>
Or did all three merely make incremental improvements on earlier proto-blogs? The answer is most likely "yes" to all of the above. In truth, awarding the title "first blogger" is more than a little tricky because the definitions of blog and blogger are slippery. Any definition should probably include posts sorted by date, with the newest posts at the top and the rest archived for future use (criteria that would eliminate the Drudge Report, for instance).
<BR><BR>
Winer is a pioneer of Web syndication techniques and editor of Scripting News, which launched on April 1, 1997.
<BR><BR>
He boasts on his site that Scripting News "bootstrapped the blogging revolution" and that it is the "longest currently running Web log on the Internet." A decade ago, however, Winer wasn't actually using the term "Web log," nor does he claim to have invented the term. Winer did not respond to repeated requests for comment from CNET News.com until after this article appeared. He replied in a post claiming "the first blogs were inspired" by Scripting News. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
There were also a lot of lesser known people keeping web journals and online diaries back in the mid 90s before anyone called it a blogging. The article also talks about the .plan files that people used to pass around in Unix.

A technical paper has proven what most everyone already knew.  That fake websites and blogs exist and the reason they exist is to get people to click on ads. The <I>Times</I> <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/19/technology/19spam.html?ex=1331956800&en=2541002ad3db4156&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">article</A> says the study (<A HREF="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hchen/paper/www07.pdf">PDF Link</A>) found that the search spam and fake sites exist because the spammers are after the ad revenues.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The researchers said large advertisers were to blame for a significant share of the spam problem.
<BR><BR>
"Ultimately, it is advertisers' money that is funding the search-spam industry, which is increasingly cluttering the Web with low-quality content and reducing Web users' productivity," they write in the paper, which will be presented in May at the International World Wide Web Conference in Banff, Alberta.
<BR><BR>
Mr. Wang, group manager and senior researcher for cybersecurity and systems management at Microsoft, said, "The good guys are part of the problem."
<BR><BR>
The researchers' specific findings included evidence that some blog-hosting services have permitted an explosion of phony doorway pages. For example, the researchers noted that such pages were far more prevalent in Google�s blogspot.com service than in other hosting domains. The Microsoft Research team has worked extensively with the managers of Microsoft's Spaces blog-hosting service to detect and identify search-engine spam, Mr. Wang said. Google would not comment for the record on its own efforts to combat such practices.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Many bloggers have encountered splogs that either copy content from a blog's feed or mix headlines or nonsense content from various feeds with the keywords they are trying to target. Everyone knew these existed but the study itself is interested because it shows how the spammers utilize search engines, splogs and doorway pages to generate revenues at the expense of bloggers. The study also found some of their favorite keywords like drugs and ringtones. Some of the blog farms (aka splog farms) out there are getting pretty sophisticated and these annoying spammers will probably continue to get more sophisticated over time.

Vecosys has a <A HREF="http://www.vecosys.com/2007/03/19/the-twitterfication-of-the-blogosphere/">post</A> about Twitter that includes a graph showing posts about Twitter soaring on BlogPulse. Because of its popularity there are quite a few new tools and applications emerging for twittering twits. For those not in the know Twitter is a new form of microblogging where entries can only be a maximum of 140 characters long and there are no graphics. Entries can be submitted via IM or text message or through the web-based interface. It may sound dull at first but Twitter has a social component, including friends, that helps make it more addictive. This post describes a few of the new tools available to Twitter users.
<BR><BR>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.twitterholic.com/">Twitterholic</A> is a new a-list for Twitter that shows the Top 100 Twits. It isn't perfect because some top Twits are not there. For example, John Edwards has well over 1,000 followers but he isn't currently listed.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.booktwo.org/swotter/">Swotter</A> reads books to you in Twitter if you can handle it. Currently Swotter is reading James Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>.
<LI><A HREF="http://twittermap.com/twittervision">Twittervision</A> is an addictive mashup of Google Maps and new Twitter posts. It shows recent Twitter posts, the Twitterer's avatar and the location in the world the Twitter entry came from in real time. 
<LI><A HREF="http://twittermap.com/search/">Twittersearch</A> allows you to search through twitter posts. It uses Lego heads to rank search popularity.
<LI><I>Wired's</I> Monkey Bites has a twitter tool <A HREF="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/03/8_cool_twitter_.html">post</A> that discusses Twitter client tools for the Mac and Windows like <A HREF="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific/">Twitterrific (Mac)</A> and <A HREF="http://rareedge.com/twitteroo/">Twitteroo (Windows)</A>.
<LI><A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/">Tinyurl</A> appears to the top choice for make URLs short enough to fit on Twitter. Was David Berlind at ZDNet not <A HREF="http://www.howtoweb.com/cgi-bin/insider.pl?zone=1211061">crazy</A> when he <A HREF="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Berlind/?p=200">suggested</A> that TinyURL could be the next YouTube? <A HREF="http://slink.in/">Slink.in</A>, <A HREF="http://www.shorturl.com/">Shorturl</A>, <A HREF="http://snipurl.com/">Snipurl</A> and <A HREF="http://lnk.in/">Ink.in</A> are alternatives. So far Tinyurl has held up well under what must be an increasing server load.
<LI>The <A HREF="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/">Twitter Fan Wiki</A> lists many more tools, mashups and apps.
<LI>Finally on the silly side is <A HREF="http://twitter.com/Hasselhoff">The Hoff's Twitter</A> which was funny at first but it appears to be a bot that quickly starts repeating things David Hasselhoff is doing like "Having teeth whitened."
<BR><BR>
Things that would be very useful would a service that lets you put a Twitter blog on your own domain and/or more flexibility in adding code to Twitter pages. You can keep up with more Twitter stuff on our <A HREF="http://twitter.com/bloggersblog">Twitter microblog</A>.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/youtube.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="YouTube">The Associated Press is <A HREF="http://mashable.com/2007/03/18/youtube-video-awards/">reporting</A> (hat tip <A HREF="http://mashable.com/2007/03/18/youtube-video-awards/">Mashable</A>) that YouTube is going to release a list of the best YouTube videos from 2006 tomorrow. The AP says the list of nominees is at <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/YTAwards">www.youtube.com/YTAwards</A> but the page is either not loading or that is not the right URL. But the AP does list some familiar faces as nominees.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The video-sharing Web site announced Monday that it will hold the first YouTube Video Awards to recognize the best-user created videos of 2006. The awards will be handed out in seven categories: most creative, most inspirational, best series, best comedy, musician of the year, best commentary and "most adorable video ever."
<BR><BR>
The nominees, picked by YouTube, are compiled in a gallery at www.youtube.com/YTAwards. YouTube community members can vote on their favorites beginning Monday and concluding on Friday. The winners, as chosen by the community, will be announced March 25. Each will be prominently featured on YouTube and receive a trophy, the design of which will be revealed later.
<BR><BR>
Among the nominees are noted "vloggers" Paul Robinett ("Renetto") and Peter Oakley ("Geriatric1927"). The comedy of Barats and Bereta, and Smosh, is also nominated, as are series such as Lonelygirl15's and "Ask a Ninja." The power pop band OK Go is perhaps the most professional of the nominees; it's nominated for the famous treadmill-choreographed music video, "Here It Goes Again."

Robert Scoble <A HREF="http://scobleizer.com/2007/03/18/youtube-copies-vloggies/">points out</A> that these YouTube Video Awards are a copy of the annual Vloggies.  Vloggies is a much better name.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
I have the pleasure of confirming the rumors: Heather Harde, currently the SVP of Mergers and Acquisitions at Fox Interactive Media, will start her new job as the CEO of the TechCrunch Network (and my boss) by the end of the month. This isn't the way I hoped to announce this news, but Om Malik broke the story after an internal Fox email got out.
<BR><BR>
It was tough to talk Heather into leaving Fox, where she�s been for the last ten years. In that time she's had a combination of operating and corporate development roles. Most recently, she was part of the founding executive team of Fox Interactive Media. At FIM she ran the mergers and acquisitions team, which was responsible for eight acquisitions, totaling $1.3 billion, and two equity investment deals. Prior to Fox, Heather was at business school at Harvard.

<A HREF="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Robert Scoble</A> used to work for Microsoft and was often referred to as the Microsoft blogger.  But Scoble now has some tough words for his former employer according to a <I>Times Online</I> <A HREF="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article1529988.ece">article</A>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
At a "global summit" of its most-valued software developers, Microsoft repeatedly declared that it would "win" in search and other parts of its Windows Live internet strategy.
<BR><BR>
"The words are empty," Scoble responded. "Microsoft�s internet execution sucks (on the whole). Its search sucks. Its advertising sucks. If that's 'in it to win', then I don't get it."
<BR><BR>
He continued: "Microsoft isn't going away. Don't get me wrong. They have record profits, record sales, all that. But on the inter-net? Come on.
<BR><BR>
"Microsoft: stop the talk. Ship a better search, a better advertising system than Google, a better hosting service than Amazon, a better cross-platform web development ecosystem than Adobe, and get some services out there that are innovative."
<BR><BR>
Scoble's comments reflect wider concerns - shared by some Microsoft insiders - that the poorly understood Windows Live initiative is failing to make the impact expected when it was unveiled 18 months ago.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
It would probably be much easier for Microsoft if there were not lots of other bloggers that agree with Robert Scoble. Microsoft had <A HREF="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/15/microsoft-hires-michael-gartenberg-as-new-evangelist/">hired</A> Michael Gartenberg to replace Robert Scoble as its new blogging evangelist but he <A HREF="http://www.901am.com/2007/scoble-replacement-quits-microsoft-after-5-minutes.html">quit</A>.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Anna Wintour is as picky with words as she is with her wardrobe. According to one Vogue-er, "They are expanding the Vogue Web site and getting more involved with the Internet. But Anna hates the word 'blog' so much, she refuses to call anything on her site a blog and has charged her staff with coming up with a new word that isn't as garish-sounding. She wants it ASAP - in time for launch." However, a source close to Wintour said, "Anna just doesn't want people to refer to stories as blogs, because they're not. It's an improper use of the word." A rep said, "Anna has nothing against blogs."
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
So don't ever expect to find anything called a blog on <A HREF="http://www.style.com/vogue/">Vogue's website</A>. It will be interesting to see what Vogue's staff comes up with to replace the word blog. Eat the Press <A HREF="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2007/03/16/need-to-know-031607-c_e_43568.html">suggests</A> "blogue" for the new word. The Writer's Blog is <A HREF="http://www.writerswrite.com/wblog.php?wblog=316071">asking its readers</A> to help Anna's staff out by coming up with a fashionable alternative to the "garish" word blog.

90% of my blogging is now on Twitter...
<BR><BR>
If you want to hear my thoughts going forward I suggest joining my twitter group: http://twitter.com/JasonCalacanis
<BR><BR>
you'll get like 2-15 alerts on your phone/AIM a day with my links, thoughts, discussions, etc.
<BR><BR>
I'm thinking of doing a week of Twitter-only blogging.... so, join now!
<BR><BR>
500 people are already on the group... crazy!
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Clearly, Twitter is already reducing blog posts for some users.  Some are suggesting that Twitter will become the place for short posts while regular blogs are used for longer posts and analysis. That's the long and short of it for now anyway.

A <I>New York Times</I> <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/17/business/17online.html?ex=1331784000&en=4c67e4073a190938&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">article</A> discusses analysis by venture capitalist <A HREF="http://lsvp.wordpress.com">Jeremy Liew</A> that indicate that it may take monster traffic to build a company that makes $50 million a year in ad revenues. Liew's analysis says a general interest website would need four billion pageviews a month in order to earn $50 million in ad revenues a year.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Let's say you wanted to build an advertising-supported online media business that took in $50 million a year in revenue. How many users would you have to attract to get there?
<BR><BR>
Probably too many for most people to even try, if the numbers run by Jeremy Liew, a venture capitalist at Lightspeed Venture Partners, are accurate. On his blog (lsvp.wordpress.com), Mr. Liew determined that even the type of site that can get the largest advertiser payments per user would have to be immensely popular before it made that kind of money.
<BR><BR>
The analysis is "sobering," wrote Tim O'Reilly, the chief executive of O�Reilly Media, a publisher of computer books. "This may be why more entrepreneurs are going for low-investment sites that don�t need an exit but provide 'lifestyle businesses' for their owners," he wrote on Radar, his company's blog (<A HREF="http://radar.oreilly.com">radar.oreilly.com</A>).
<BR><BR>
That is, rather than seek venture financing and hire a staff, it may be better for one or two people to create a relatively simple site � say, a hobbyist blog for guitar enthusiasts � and use a service like Google AdWords to, hopefully, make enough money to live on. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
There have been many multi-million dollar investments in Web 2.0 companies that hope to make their money solely from ad revenues. You have to wonder how good of an idea that is given that it appears to be very difficult to build a company that can bring in $50 million a year in advertising revenues. Jeremy Liew's posts about building $50 million online media companies can be found <A HREF="http://lsvp.wordpress.com/2007/02/26/three-ways-to-build-an-online-media-business-to-50m-in-revenue/">here</A> and <A HREF="http://lsvp.wordpress.com/2007/03/14/more-on-building-an-online-media-company-to-50m-in-revenues/">here</A>.

Personal Bee's founder will come in as VP of business development at Technorati; we're not sure whether the value of the target was in engineering, where Technorati's been weak. Any significance beyond that?

You may already know that Twitter was a <A HREF="http://www.bloggersblog.com/cgi-bin/bloggersblog.pl?bblog=311073">big hit at SXSW</A>. This was where the big upswing in Twitter posts started. Since then Steve Rubel has been asking if people will <A HREF="http://www.micropersuasion.com/2007/03/twitter_human_a.html">blog less</A> now that are twittering more. Dave Winer offers some <A HREF="http://stories.scripting.com/2007/03/14/theFutureOfTwitter.html">thoughts on Twitter's future</A>. He asks whether Twitter will have competitors. Tara at HorsePigCow <A HREF="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2007/03/15/twits-twittering-for-the-sake-of-tweets-or-thats-not-why-i-twitter/">blogs</A> about why Twitter matters to her. She has been using Twitter since last May or June. Hitwise offers <A HREF="http://weblogs.hitwise.com/heather-hopkins/2007/03/twitter_stats_growing_but_stil.html">more Twitter traffic data</A>. 
<BR><BR>
Meanwhile, some bloggers are already ready for Twitter to crash and die. Some argue that Twitter has already peaked or that it is just a fad. For example, Web1797 <A HREF="http://web1979.wordpress.com/2007/03/14/rip-twitter-2007-2007/">thinks</A> that "Twitter will flame-out before the end of 2007." Creating Passionate Users <A HREF="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/sxsw_interactiv.html">reminds everyone</A> that it is the face-to-face interactions that matter most.
<BR><BR>
Like many other bloggers we have also set up a <A HREF="http://twitter.com/bloggersblog">Twitter</A> for Bloggers Blog for random thoughts or ideas or for stuff that's just too short to blog. We also didn't want to be left lonely and twitterless. Twitter might be more useful to publishers if you could have Twitter on your own domain but that's definitely a feature or service that could (and should) be added in the future. It is impossible to accurately predict what will happen with Twitter but Twitter does seem to have already reached a traffic level that makes it unlikely to just fade away -- especially with zealous Twitters like <A HREF="http://twitter.com/scobleizer">Robert Scoble</A> and <A HREF="http://twitter.com/steverubel">Steve Rubel</A>. 
<BR><BR>
For Twitter noobs there is the <A HREF="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/">Twitter Fan Wiki</A> which has links to lots of articles and resources. Webware has also posted a <A HREF="http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9697867-2.html">Newbies Guide to Twitter</A>. Even professionals can make use of Twitter -- <A HREF="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/03/15/eight-ways-twitter-is-useful-professionally/">Web Worker Daily</A> list eight reasons why.

An <A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/cnnm/070302/030107_new_house_marketing_method.html?.v=1&.pf=real-estate">article</A> on CNN/Money talks about the "YouTubing" of real estate and how homeowners are using videos to help sell their homes. Some of the videos are more elaborate than others.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Nearly 80 percent of home buyers start their search on the Internet - soon they'll have more to look at.
<BR><BR>
On its Web site, the Peninsula on Indian River Bay development in Delaware has begun using high-quality, television news-style presentation to sell homes. On the site, viewers take interactive tours of the property, led by two on-line hosts, through different site "channels."
<BR><BR>
According to Roland Varesko, president of Ecendent Interactive, the production company that put together Peninsula's site, nobody is doing this on as grand a scale as the Peninsula. "It's like having your own TV show," he says.
<BR><BR>
But the trend is sure to spread. Even now, the economics are such that a development of 50 to 100 homes could afford a Web site like Peninsula's, according to Varesko. And big real estate brokers, such as Century 21, Coldwell Banker (both part of Realogy) and Re/Max, are quickly ramping up.
<BR><BR>
"I believe streaming videos on Web sites is the wave of the future," says Charlie Young, vice president for marketing for broker Coldwell Banker.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The article appears to be correct in identifying a growing use of video in selling homes. There are thousands of home videos on YouTube. 
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/homesforsaleonyoutube.gif" ALT="Homes for Sale on YouTube">
<BR><BR>
If you search <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=house+for+sale&search=Search">house for sale</A> on YouTube you get over 3,000 listings. A <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=home+for+sale&search=Search">Home for sale</A> search gives over 4,000 videos. It is a good way to showcase a house and with the growing housing bubble people probably need any advantage they can get. Some of the videos are placed by individual owners and other are placed by realty companies. For example, the <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=HFRealty">HFRealty channel</A> currently has videos for nine homes including a <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYmWZlj8vmQ">3 bedroom home</A> in Kissimmee, Florida.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
I have been called a patriot, and treated like a criminal. I have been called a Soldier and treated as the enemy. I have been told to get a hair cut and not to eat the civilians. My humor misses most people. Sometimes it is too rough, too dark, and too close to home. But that is what happens when you have seen too much and spoken too little. It finds a way to the surface. A way to be heard.
<BR><BR>
I have stood by long enough.
<BR><BR>
I have been mistreated, and I have seen others mistreated. I had the system that is supposed to help me, hurt me. I have seen it hurt others. I have seen this place break a Soldier down. I have seen the hope slowly leeched from a Soldier. Vibrant and full of pride, ready to be healed and return to the fight, broken down, spirit trampled, and hope taken from them. I have seen it. And I have been that Soldier.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/rugsdonerightblog.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Rugs Done Right Blog">We thought you would want to know that a retailer of rugs called Rugs Done Right has launched a <A HREF="http://www.rugsdoneright.com/blog/">blog</A>. The rug blog combines rug care tips with decorating and purchasing advice. A press release can be found <A HREF="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/3/prweb511789.htm">here</A> for the blog which is focused on area rugs.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The Rugs Done Right Blog focuses on area rugs, highlighting new styles and trends, care and cleaning tips, purchasing advice and decorating ideas. Blog posts are written by Jamie Carney, an area rug proprietor and the BuyRugsDirect.com site owner. The move to RugsDoneRight.com offers Carney the opportunity to provide additional services to her Buy Rugs Direct customers, and the blog is the first of these new features.
<BR><BR>
Blog topics vary, but the central theme is always area rugs. Posts are short and succinct, quickly making a point or offering advice before directing readers to a link with more information. Recent posts have discussed: what to look for when choosing an area rug for your home; the proper care and cleaning of rugs; the pros and cons of different materials; and how to install and protect area rugs throughout your home.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
They have gone a little tag crazy on the blog with several dozen tags per post. Despite the overuse of tags the blog definitely makes the rug retail website more interesting. For example, <A HREF="http://www.rugsdoneright.com/blog/index.cfm?commentID=11">this post</A> shows how not using a proper rug pad under an area rug allowed the hardwood floor underneath it to sustain damage.  Over $6000 in damage was done to the hardwood floor. The post includes a picture of the damage and it isn't pretty.

These sets within sets are called collections. The collections are represented by a mosaic icon.  That's an example of a collection on the right.  You can see a few more <A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eric/collections/">here</A>.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Flickr collections visually differentiate themselves from Flickr sets by using the mosaic-style icon you see in the screenshot above. Unfortunately it looks like collections are Flickr Pro-only, though any plain old Flickr account holder knows you don't get enough sets with you free account to have much of a need for collections anyway.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/projectredstripe.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Project Red Stripe"><A HREF="http://www.economistgroup.com">The Economist Group</A>, the publisher of <I>The Economist</I>, has a launched a site called <A HREF="http://www.projectredstripe.com">Project Red Stripe</A>. Project Red Stripe is a six-member team comprised of The Economist Group's employees that has the task of creating an innovative and web-based product, service or business model by July 2007. The team is doing their own in-house research and they are also soliticing ideas from the outside. Ideas can be submitted on the Project Red Stripe website. 
<BR><BR>
Some bloggers have poked fun at Economist Group's web business idea seekers. You can see a few funny headlines <A HREF="http://buzzfeed.com/buzz/Project_Red_Stripe">here</A> on Buzzfeed. You will also see a photograph of Red Stripe beer there. Many <A HREF="http://slashdot.org/articles/07/03/10/2158202.shtml">Slashdot commenters</A> were also critical of the new site from <I>The Economist</I>. Team Red Stripe <A HREF="http://projectredstripe.com/blog/2007/03/13/talking-among-toffs/">discussed</A> some the criticism on their <A HREF="http://www.projectredstripe.com/blog/">blog</A>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
We were not surprised, then, when many Slashdot users either derided or hammered our idea collection effort after a news item about it was posted on the site's homepage on Sunday morning. Some suggested we'd be better off drinking lots of Jamaican beer. Another commenter wrote: "This is the most stupid idea I have ever heard out of [The Economist]. They actually will compensate you, with a rocking 6-mo web-subscription to economist.com (street value: roughly $50)... Perhaps the Economist should actually talk to their economists, and ask them what 'Incentive Compatibility' means. If I were the Economist, I'd be terribly embarrassed about this."
<BR><BR>
As often with such debates on Slashdot, however, they raise an important point, which is then only superficially discussed before moving on to other more fundamental things (the debate quickly digressed to talking about democracy, Hitler, the Soviet Union and, of course, Ayn Rand). Yet the underlying issue is indeed a crucial one � and one we probably need to resolve somehow if we want to make this project a success: How can we cleverly combine � to mutual benefit - ultimately for-profit efforts such as Project Red Stripe and "commons-based peer production", in the words of Yochai Benkler, a professor at Yale Law School.

Apparently, you don't have to use the form if you don't want to.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
And if our terms and conditions really keep you from submitting your great idea, you can always do what Jeff Jarvis, the creator of the popular blog <A HREF="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2007/03/09/the-innovation-race/">BuzzMachine</A>, has suggested - and some have already done: post them on you own blog. But don't forget to send us a link.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
You can also post your comments on a blog like Shel Israel did <A HREF="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2007/03/blogger_base_ca.html">here</A> because he did not want to post it "on any steenking form." At least two of Shel's ideas involved <I>The Economist</I> hiring Shel or someone like Shel. It looks like <A HREF="http://projectredstripe.com/blog/2007/03/12/keep-them-coming/">they will</A> hit their goal of 250 idea submissions. They admit their traffic has been thanks to the Slashdot post and posts from bloggers.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/vhb.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Vancouver Housing Market Blog">The blogger at the <A HREF="http://van-housing.blogspot.com/">Vancouver Housing Market Blog</A> was blogging regularly until one day readers of the blog loaded up the site's homepage (or their RSS reader) to find this shocking message.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Things have changed on the off-line front. I have to go now. It has been a lot of fun. I might be back sometime in the future, but I need to stop for awhile anyway.
<BR><BR>
TaTa For Now.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
And just as things are looking pretty grim on the housing front especially in the subprime market. The departure of the blogger at the Vancouver Housing Market Blog (VHB) resulted in <A HREF="http://www.thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2007/02/20/VHB/">this article</A> appearing in <I>The Tyee</I> called, "Pop Goes Real Estate Bubble Blogger." The article says some of the blog's daily readers were shocked to read the blogger's goodbye message.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Usually, the VHB provides links, charts, stats and commentary (like about the number of properties on the Vancouver market and their average prices, historical patterns, comparisons between Vancouver and other cities) that have the implicit questions -- is this a bubble and will it crash?
<BR><BR>
His last post on Friday left no indication that a halt was in the works, so those who visited his blog on Monday morning expressed surprise. "This is very sudden and I am sad to hear that the mysterious VHB will no longer be making the prescient posts I have become used to reading over the past 12+ months," said a commenter named Mohican.
<BR><BR>
"Please!!! Don't go! She'll come round!! Just involve her more...She can do some graphs and you guys can research, together," said a commenter named Mighty Mouse.
<BR><BR>
"Well good luck with that. If you can, keep the site alive. It will be interesting to go back and check the comments in the future. We are going to look like either prescient geniuses or ignorant boobs. I don't think there is much in between," said a commenter named Freako.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
When a local blogger covering a niche subject like the housing market disappears it can leave quite a hole. All that good fresh coverage and insight just stops coming. Since leaving the VHB blogger has returned to leave this message.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Thanks to all who have posted such nice things over the past few weeks. Life is going very well, thank you. I do miss blogging in a way, but on the whole it is better to get on with the coolness that is life. Enjoy the crash! (Whenever it comes . . .) VHB out.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
It look like someone else will have to pick up the slack in local housing market coverage for Vancouver.

PaidContent.org says the companies is worried about the effect search engine influence may have once they move the site to Topix.com.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Topix.net, the news search site majority owned by Gannett, McClatchy and Tribune, has bought its .com domain after paying a Canadian company $1 million in January (late last year Topix received $15 million funding), and is planning to move the site onto Topix.com, reports WSJ. The story, which makes a bigger point about search engine influence on other sites, says it is worried about the effect on its Google rankings after this. About 50 percent of visits to Topix come through a search engine, and about 90 percent out of that is through Google...Even if traffic to Topix, which gets about 10 million visitors a month, dropped just 10 percent, that would essentially be a 10 percent loss in ad revenue, CEO Rick Skrenta said in the story. Topix will run its site at both Topix.net and Topix.com for awhile, in order to get over any unpredictabilities in Google and other search results.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

Viacom says YouTube has about 160,000 unauthorized video clips that people have viewed over 1.5 billion times. The BBC has a <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6446193.stm">more detailed story</A> that includes comments from Viacom's statement.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
"YouTube's strategy has been to avoid taking proactive steps to curtail the infringement on its site," said Viacom in a statement.
<BR><BR>
"Their business model, which is based on building traffic and selling advertising off of unlicensed content, is clearly illegal and is in obvious conflict with copyright laws."
<BR><BR>
Last month, Viacom, which also owns cable networks VH1 and Comedy Central, told YouTube to remove 100,000 "unauthorised" clips.
<BR><BR>
Viacom said its demand came after YouTube and Google failed to install tools to "filter" the unauthorised video clips following negotiations.
<BR><BR>
"There is no question that YouTube and Google are continuing to take the fruit of our efforts without permission and destroying enormous value in the process," it said. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The article says that Google hasn't responded yet to Viacom's court action. Viacom's press statement can be found <A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/070313/nytu068.html">here</A>. Viacom owns Comedy Central, MTV, BET, Spike, Nickelodeon, DreamWorks and several other film and tv networks.

A new blog called <A HREF="http://blog.vcu.edu/nascar/">The View from Here: The Business of NASCAR</A> from two Virginia Commonwealth University professors is discussing the business behind the popular sport of NASCAR racing. Richmond.com <A HREF="http://www.richmond.com/sci-tech/output.aspx?Article_ID=4608787&Vertical_ID=127&tier=1&position=7">reports</A> that the blog is an offshoot of a NASCAR business class taught by the two professors.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Here in Richmond, at Virginia Commonwealth University, professors Jon Ackley and Michael Pitts decided to explore the business of NASCAR by creating a class titled "From Dirt Tracks to Madison Avenue." The class, a five-week honors module, has been offered three times during the fall semester and will be offered again in the fall of 2007.
<BR><BR>
The class featured a variety of speakers from all different aspects of NASCAR, including Katherine Wintsch from The Martin Agency, the advertising firm that handles the NASCAR account, and Nate Ryan, motor sports columnist for USA Today.
<BR><BR>
"Our goal is to give the students an overview of the business side of NASCAR," Ackley said. "We talk very little about actual racing although we don't bypass that discussion when questions are raised. In the end, when students indicate that they might still not be fans but appreciate the magnitude of the sport, we believe we have accomplished our goal."
<BR><BR>
Now the two professors have broken out of the classroom and onto the Internet with a new blog. The blog, "The View From Here: The Business of NASCAR," was launched on Feb. 15. Like the class, it explores the money end of NASCAR.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The blog is updated weekly instead of daily. There are already some interesting posts like <A HREF="http://blog.vcu.edu/nascar/2007/03/hey_how_much_do_you_make.html">this post</A> about driver's salaries and <A HREF="http://blog.vcu.edu/nascar/2007/02/cheating_and_toyotas_welcome_1.html">this post</A> about Daytona 500 infractions.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/twitter.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Twitter">There is a lot of buzz lately about <A HREF="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</A>, which is a new mobile communications service from <A HREF="http://obvious.com/">Obvious</A>. Twitter lets you establish a page on twitter.com and update it from a mobile phone, IM or webpage with short messages about what you are currently doing. If you set up a page on Twitter you can send an SMS to Twitter and it will update your page. You can also update your page from the web or by sending an instant message. Twitter can be useful for telling people where you are going or communicating with a group of friends. Short Attention Spaz <A HREF="http://jay.vox.com/library/post/twitter-rocks-my-sxsw-world.html">calls</A> Twitter a "a mix between IM, SMS and social networking." There was a lot of discussion of Twitter at the recent SXSW conference see <A HREF="http://roj.as/entries/2007/03/11/that-was-fast-2/">here</A>, <A HREF="http://www.brianalvey.com/2007/03/10/putting-the-twit-in-twitter/">here</A>, <A HREF="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2007/03/11/twitter_crowd_goes_bananas_at_sxsw.html">here</A>, <A HREF="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2007/03/twitter_tips_th.html">here</A>, <A HREF="http://www.drumsnwhistles.com/2007/03/11/twitter-this/">here</A>, <A HREF="http://www.ericrice.com/blog/?p=422">here</A>, <A HREF="http://www.johnwiseman.ca/blogging/web-20/twitter-at-sxsw/">here</A>, <A HREF="http://ourfounder.typepad.com/leblog/2007/03/why_do_i_twitte.html">here</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tomorrowstrends.com/2007/03/twitter_explode_1.html">here</A>, <A HREF="http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9696343-2.html?part=rss&tag=feed&subj=Webware">here</A>, <A HREF="http://www.onebyonemedia.com/twitter-is-the-new-flickr/">here</A>, <A HREF="http://www.krempasky.com/?p=1358">here</A>, <A HREF="http://brandcurve.com/whoa-twitter/">here</A>, <A HREF="http://benbarren.blogspot.com/2007/03/federated-media-vs-twitter.html">here</A>, <A HREF="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/03/twitter_is_ruli.html">here</A> and <A HREF="http://www.bestdamntech.com/sxsw-report-its-official-twitter-just-blew-up/">here</A>.

The SXSW conference even had its own <A HREF="http://sxsw.twitter.com/">Twitter account</A> set up.

The Twitter blog <A HREF="http://twitter.com/blog/2007/03/text-join-sxsw-to-40404.html">notes</A> that even presidential candidate John Edwards is <A HREF="http://twitter.com/johnedwards">twittering</A>. John Edwards seems to be trying out every Web 2.0 service he can.
<BR><BR>
Mashable has <A HREF="http://mashable.com/2007/03/11/twitter/">created</A> a funny graphic called the evolution of blogging, cat version. It shows blogging move from Blogger (posts about what the cat is doing), to Flickr (cat photos), to YouTube (cat videos) and finally to Twitter which shows brief text messages about what the cat is doing every couple minutes.
<BR><BR>
Twitter is a not really an evolution of blogging. It is a much shorter form of blogging using SMS messages. Twitter entries are much shorter than most blogger entries. A twitter entry can only be up to 140 characters in length. We don't yet know how many twitters people will be willing to send or receive before it reaches a Twitter annoyance threshold. What's clear is that Twitter has the potential for both very useful and very annoying uses. Lifehack.org offers a <A HREF="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/5-ways-to-use-twitter-for-good.html">post</A> about five good ways to use Twitter.
<BR><BR>
We've set up a <A HREF="http://www.bloggersblog.com/twitter/">Twitter category</A> on BloggersBlog.com. So far this is only the second post in the Twitter category -- we mentioned Twitter once in a <A HREF="http://www.bloggersblog.com/cgi-bin/bloggersblog.pl?bblog=1028061">post</A> last October about the launch of Obvious Corp. Given the buzz over Twitter we expect more Twitter coverage be needed in the future.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/myyahoobeta.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="My Yahoo Beta">Yahoo is offering a beta of the new My Yahoo at <A HREF="http://cm.my.yahoo.com/upgrade">http://cm.my.yahoo.com/upgrade</A>. The new My Yahoo is a sleeker version of Yahoo's customizable homepage service.  The upgrade includes the ability to read the full feed in the My Yahoo Reader -- something many people have been hoping for. You can also make new pages to cover specific categories like you can on <A HREF="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</A>. The new My Yahoo also offers some Packaged Pages that include pre-built pages for topics like Geeks, Gamers, Celebrity Gossip, Fashion Forward and Parenting. These pages make it easy to quickly add a My Yahoo page that carries feeds from some of the top blogs and web publishers. As Screenwerk <A HREF="http://gesterling.wordpress.com/2007/03/09/myyahoo-20/">notes</A> the My Yahoo beta also includes social features like sharing and bookmarks.  Local content from Local Yahoo is also included. 
<BR><BR>
TechCrunch's <A HREF="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/08/all-new-my-yahoo/">post</A> about the My Yahoo explains how Yahoo provides a default set of content based on what it already knows about the user.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
But the most significant changes are are under the hood. Instead of presenting a default set of content to new users to start them off, My Yahoo is now analyzing known data about the user (zip code from IP address and the areas of Yahoo that the user visits often) to create a customized version right at signup. So, for example, if the user tends to go to the Yahoo Movies property occasionally, a Yahoo Movies module will be auto added when they create a new My Yahoo account.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Read/Write Web has an <A HREF="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/my_yahoo_web20_makeover.php">extensive post</A> about the new My Yahoo. Read/Write Web says that widgets will eventually be part of My Yahoo. Jeremy Zawodny has a <A HREF="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001474.html">post</A> about the My Yahoo beta as well. Zawodny's post includes information about the My Yahoo crawler and about how to ping My Yahoo.
<BR><BR>
Also <A HREF="http://myyblog.com/blog/">this blog</A> claims to be a My Yahoo blog by Yahoo that is coming soon. Yahoo, Inc. is the <A HREF="http://whois.domaintools.com/myyblog.com">registrant</A>. Currently the blog just has a post from March 8th, 2009 that says "stay tuned."

This one is called the <A HREF="http://www.positron.org/projects/bluechute/">blueChute e-ink tablet</A>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Until e-ink gets cheap and ordinary people can gaze into their very own super high contrast electronic copy of the NY Times, we'll have to settle for sneak peeks at concept devices like this, E Ink's blueChute e-ink tablet. Even though the exact functionality of the device has yet to be decided -- currently it's functioning as a glorified demo platform -- the blueChute's Bluetooth support and microSD slot would suggest that it could be used to display maps streamed from a mobile phone, or have it display widget-like information from a nearby tethered computer.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Eventually many people will be reading blog posts on portable devices similar to this one.  But like Engadget said it won't happen until electronic ink displays become cheap and mass produced.

Emarketer is <A HREF="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?1004636">reporting</A> on a recent <A HREF="http://www.youth-trends.com/">Youth Trends</A> study of 17-to-25-year-olds. For both males and females <A HREF="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</A> was the number one website. What's most interesting about the study is that two blogs were among the top ten most popular website for females aged 17 to 25. The two blogs (both celebrity gossip blogs) are <A HREF="http://www.pinkisthenewblog.com">Pink Is the New Blog</A> and <A HREF="http://www.wwtdd.com">What Would Tyler Durden Do</A>. In case you don't know Tyler Durden is a character from the <I>Fight Club</I> movie. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The survey is conducted quarterly, and the previous quarter marked the first time that Facebook was tops among both women and men.
<BR><BR>
Two blogs were in the female top 10 list for the first time: Pink Is the New Blog and What Would Tyler Durden Do? (WWTDD). Both blogs have an entertainment/gossip focus, which Mr. Weil says "is consistent with Gen Y females' current adoration with content surrounding celebrities and their 'uh oh' moments."
<BR><BR>
MySpace was second on the top 10 list for females, but it remained sixth for males, with the percentage of 17-to-25-year-old males listing it as their favorite moving up slightly from 13% in the previous quarterly listing to 14%. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Blogs are getting very popular if they are now among the top websites young people visit.  It is surprising that the <A HREF="http://www.perezhilton.com">Perez Hilton</A> blog was not one of the the top sites as it is often referred to as the most popular celebrity blog.

It would be interesting if Google would tell us more about the popular items in Google Blog Search sort of like Technorati does in its <A HREF="http://technorati.com/pop/">Popular</A> section.  Technorati also has a list of the <A HREF="http://technorati.com/pop/youtube/">most popular videos</A>.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
However, on a day-to-day basis for those of us here in the International Zone in the middle of Baghdad, this has meant that our nights are filled with explosions and gunfire and lots and lots of helicopters flying overhead. It really seems, at times, as if they're flying in circles around our trailers, just to see how many of us they can wake up! (However, as one of my friends pointed out, at least you know that you've got someone keeping you safe this way.)
<BR><BR>
I'm usually in the office until 9 or 10 p.m., so I miss the lightshows that my friends have been telling me about--all those explosions have a visual aspect, apparently. But in terms of the noise of it all, it's kind of like sleeping through the 4th of July or New Year's Eve for weeks on end! (Or trying to sleep through it...)

It's now been more than two years since the first story was submitted and dugg on Digg. Since then you guys have helped Digg move from a personal project amongst a group of friends to a huge online community.

<BR><BR>
I'd like to let this post serve as a thank you from me to you - the Digg community faithful. You've not only made it possible for the Digg team to continue the Digg concept in new and exciting ways, but you've also driven us, with a sense of pride and excitement that genuinely makes going to work a lot of fun.

In the future human bloggers may face a new threat - robots that blog. These robot bloggers may have the advantage of having processors that are faster than our human brains and the ability to interface directly with the Internet. No typing necessary. The BBC is <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6425927.stm">seriously reporting</A> that South Korea is already concerned with ethical issues involving robots. They will be releasing the Robot Ethics Charter at the end of the year. South Korea's government also predicts robot surgeons by 2018.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
A recent government report forecast that robots would routinely carry out surgery by 2018.
<BR><BR>
The Ministry of Information and Communication has also predicted that every South Korean household will have a robot by between 2015 and 2020. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The article also says that a UK study predicts that robots will demand the same rights as human beings before 2060. If the robots are smart enough to demand rights they will have no problem blogging.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2>
Other bodies are also thinking about the robotic future. Last year a UK government study predicted that in the next 50 years robots could demand the same rights as human beings.
<BR><BR>
The European Robotics Research Network is also drawing up a set of guidelines on the use of robots.
<BR><BR>
This ethical roadmap has been assembled by researchers who believe that robotics will soon come under the same scrutiny as disciplines such as nuclear physics and Bioengineering.
<BR><BR>
A draft of the proposals said: "In the 21st Century humanity will coexist with the first alien intelligence we have ever come into contact with - robots.
<BR><BR>
"It will be an event rich in ethical, social and economic problems."  </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Even if all these robot predictions come true we humans should have at least another decade or two to blog freely without the threat of robotic competition.

A <A HREF="http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=367">post</A> on Crunchnotes says the traffic at <A HREF="http://www.techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</A> is now big enough that they sometimes overwhelm the websites of small startups when they blog about them.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
As TechCrunch traffic continues to grow, a problem is popping up more and more often - the traffic we send to a site when we write about it on its launch day can (and often does) take it down. It's not that TechCrunch traffic is that massive, but it's enough that if there's a bug somewhere in application that wasn�t noticed with small traffic testing, it can be exploited and quickly take the site down. The last week, we�ve averaged one site down per day.
<BR><BR>
Examples: We wrote about Spotplex and it went down fast, as did Amie Street and Kegulator tonight (Kegulator is more of a toy, so it doesn't really count).
<BR><BR>
Another problem is that the traffic doesn't last. See this Alexa chart for Spotplex as an example. There's a spike, and then most of the people never come back. Hopefully a few stick around, register and tell their friends, but building an application to scale to handle a TechCrunch post is a long term solution to a short term problem.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The post says sometimes startups write in and ask not to be mentioned because they aren't ready. There are startups out there in beta mode that might not yet want a flood of traffic. At the same time it is hard to have sympathy for the startups. It seems like startups should try and remain better hidden if they don't want to be mentioned on a blog.  Once you have launched a public website it is difficult to hide and blogs like TechCrunch are trying to be the first to report news of new Web 2.0 companies and websites.

The <A HREF="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1483840.ece">Times Online</A> and the <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6427355.stm">BBC</A> are reporting that an Instanbul court has blocked access to YouTube because it claims a video on YouTube offends Mustafa Kemal Atat&uuml;rk, the founding president of the Turkish Republic. It is illegal in Turkey to insult Ataturk or "turkishness."
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The court order was issued yesterday and most internet users logging onto the site in Turkey are met with a holding page with a Turkish message, which translates as: "Access to this site has been denied by court order ! ..."
<BR><BR>
Greek and Turkish YouTube users have been trading video insults over the past few months, attracting much coverage in the Turkish press. Greek videos reportedly accused the founding president of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, of homosexuality; a Turkish user responded by calling Greece the birthplace of homosexuality.
<BR><BR>
It is illegal to criticise either Ataturk or Turkishness in Turkey and the prosecutor's office in Istanbul acted despite YouTube's agreement to take down the offending videos. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The BBC says users trying to visit www.youtube.com in Turkey get the following message: "Access to www.youtube.com site has been suspended in accordance with decision no: 2007/384 dated 06.03.2007 of Istanbul First Criminal Peace Court." 
<BR><BR>
Erkan Saka at Metroblogging Instanbul <A HREF="http://istanbul.metblogs.com/archives/2007/03/istanbulites_ha.phtml">says</A> most Turkish citizens see Atat&uuml;rk as a sacred figure but questions the necessity of blocking a whole website for a single video.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The video is ugly. It insults the founder of the Republic. Like it or not, Atat&uuml;rk is a sacred figure for most of Turkish citizens. And an insulting video would trigger such a popular reaction. However, would it be necessary to legally stop the access to Youtube? In Brazil, a legal step was taken recently. But compared to this one, it is a minor intervention. In terms of net regulation, Turkey is now in league with China, Iran and some other countries in the same line....
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Turkey is trying to join the European Union but the European Union does have an issue with Article 301, the law that forbids people from insulting turkishness. YouTube is far from the first creative outlet to run into problems with the law. Nobel prize winning author <A HREF="http://www.writerswrite.com/wblog.php?wblog=1012061">Orhan Pamuk</A> almost went to jail for "insulting Turkishness."

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
It is a curious pairing. Cisco, with 55,000 employees, makes networking equipment for telecommunications providers and other big companies. Tribe.net, run by a company with eight employees, has been trampled by newer social sites like MySpace and Facebook.
<BR><BR>
But along with the recent purchase of a social network design firm, Five Across, the deal will give Cisco the technology to help large corporate clients create services resembling MySpace or YouTube to bring their customers together online. And that ambition highlights a significant shift in the way companies and entrepreneurs are thinking about social networks.
<BR><BR>
They look at MySpace and Facebook, with their tens of millions of users, as walled-off destinations, similar to first-generation online services like America Online, CompuServe and Prodigy. These big Web sites attract masses of people who have dissimilar interests and, ultimately, little in common.

enter the software social networking business. It would be even more puzzling if Cisco really wanted a goofy social network like Tribe but it turns out they do not. What Cisco <A HREF="http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/corp_030507.html">really wants</A> (hat tip <A HREF="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/03/06/cisco-buys-utah-street-networks-but-not-tribenet/">Blog Herald</A>) are the people who can make sites like Tribe and the technology behind it.

Utah Street Networks was founded in 2003 and has seven employees based in San Francisco, Calif.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Eons, the 50-plus media company for loving life on the flipside of 50, today announced $22 million in Series B financing led by Charles River Ventures, with participation from new investors Intel Capital and Humana Inc., as well as existing investors General Catalyst Partners and Sequoia Capital. The financing will fuel Eons' accelerating growth as it continues to inspire boomers to see, learn, and be more on the way to the reachable goal of living to 100.
<BR><BR>
"We're very excited that Charles River Ventures is taking a lead in this round, especially given their proven track record of investing in companies poised to establish a leadership position in emerging markets," said Jeff Taylor, founder and CEO, Eons. "Boomers are ready to play hard on the Web, and Eons is not only changing the way they connect with each other, but also how corporate America reaches this desirable demographic. Our active community, proprietary tools - such as Eons' search engine cRANKy - and expert advice are shaping a new era of activity on the Web for this audience.�
<BR><BR>
Taylor added, "We are equally pleased with Intel Capital's investment as well as the participation from our founding venture backers, General Catalyst Partners and Sequoia Capital, whose continued support is a strong endorsement of our market and our strategy."

The 50 plus demographic includes retired people as well as people still active in the workforce. A UK study <A HREF="http://www.surferssurf.com/cgi-bin/surfblog.pl?surfblog=222071">recently found</A> that 41% of "silver surfers" consider surfing the Internet a favorite pastime. Given the results of that study Eons has the potential for a very large audience.

The channel includes the <A HREF="http://www.videonacho.com/cgi-bin/vnblog.pl?video=305071">video</A> for her new song as well as videos for several of her past hit songs. The new song "With Love" has the same name as a new fragrance coming out from Hilary Duff in April called "With Love...Hilary Duff."
<BR><BR>
Hilary Duff and her record label Hollywood Records are smart to recognize how quickly YouTube is becoming a music hot spot.  We mentioned several weeks ago that the <A HREF="http://www.bloggersblog.com/cgi-bin/bloggersblog.pl?bblog=128071">YouTube channels of several young musicians</A> including Ashley Tisdale, Mia Rose, Terra Naomi and Esmee are quickly growing subscriber bases. Even mainstream artists would be wise to establish channels on YouTube. If they don't or wait too long they will probably find that they face young and upcoming artists that have suddenly become very popular on YouTube and have tens of thousands -- possibly even hundreds of thousands -- of subscribers. Since launching the channel a week ago Hilary Duff has already accumulated nearly 3,000 subscribers.

Sahar Sarid at the Conceptualist <A HREF="http://conceptualist.typepad.com/the_life_of_sahar_sarid_a/2007/03/the_inevitable_.html">brings up the possibility</A> of a blogging subscription model emerging in the future. Sarid points out that newspapers, radio, television, etc all have subscrption models. Scott Karp, writing at the Blog Herald, discussed the concept more in <A HREF="http://www.blogherald.com/2007/03/04/could-blogging-adopt-a-paid-content-business-model/">this post</A>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
The issue of whether any paid content online is "better than what you can get for free" has been debated since the dawn of the Web. What arguably makes some of the top blogs better than other blogs is that, by dint of their success, they have become scoop magnets, e.g TechCrunch, Engadget. That doesn't necessarily make their reporting or analysis better, but you can always get the information there first. Of course, if they were behind a pay wall, that advantage might disappear.
<BR><BR>
That's why the Seth Godin consultant model might be more viable. Darren Rowse at Problogger, for example, offers advice to bloggers equivalent to what you might get from a paid consultant.
<BR><BR>
The argument against a paid content model for blogging begins of course with ideology - there are many blog purest who would refuse to call a paid blog a blog. Blogging, traditionally, has been about openness and inter-connectivity, which a paid subscriber wall certainly does not foster.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
In the future there will probably be some blogs run by experts in a particular field that will be able to charge a fee for access to their blog or feed. However, this will most likely be blogs/feeds that have to do with legal, medical and financial subjects that require an extensive knowledge base. There 
have always been financial newsletters that people are willing to pay a fairly high fee for and there is no reason why this won't translate into paid blogs. But paying for blogs that simply offer blogging or marketing advice seems highly unlikely because there is so much of this information already readily available. If someone offering blogging or marketing advice tries to move their blog behind a subscription wall people will just go to other blogs offering similar content. There is no shortage of good blogging or marketing advice on the Internet.
<BR><BR>
The paid blogging model technically already exists as the <I>New York Times</I> has some blogs that are behind the <I>Times Select</I> subscriber wall. The <I>Times</I> has a blog called the <A HREF="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/">Opinionator</A> that can't be read without a subscription. There are several other blogs behind the <A HREF="http://select.nytimes.com/pages/timesselect/index.html">Time Select</A> wall as well -- see the "select features" section on the right.

The pay must have been good for the bloggers the <I>WSJ</I> talked to.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Most self-employed bloggers take in between $2,000 and $10,000 a month from ad sales, says Henry Copeland, founder of BlogAds.com, a Web advertising concern based in Carrboro, N.C. The few that have huge audiences make significantly more, he adds. During election time, for example, a political blogger can bring in $20,000 to $30,000 a month, says Ken Layne, West Coast bureau chief for Wonkette.com, a political gossip blog owned by Gawker Media.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
That's much hire than what most bloggers make. Self-employed bloggers also put in many hours.  Mario Lavandeira, who blogs at the popular <A HREF="http://www.perezhilton.com">PerezHilton.com</A> blog, says he puts in 19 hour days.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Self-employed bloggers set their own schedules. Writers of breaking-news blogs say 40- to 60-hour workweeks are the norm. To scoop his competitors, Mario Lavandeira, author of the celebrity-gossip blog PerezHilton.com, says he averages 19-hour workdays that start at 5:15 a.m.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Those 19-hour days must help Perez keep ahead of his competition in the celebrity blogosphere. The <I>WSJ</I> piece says bloggers often start out with free blogging services.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
CAREER PATH: Most bloggers start out using free Web sites such as WordPress.com and Blogger.com. They say it takes at least six months to build readership and clout in the blogosphere. Mr. Lavandeira advises picking an area you'll enjoy discussing for a long time because "you have to be passionate about what you're writing." A background in journalism or communications helps but usually isn't required. "I don't want to hear where candidates went to college or where else they worked," says Ryan Block, managing editor of Engadget.com, who hires most of the site's employees. "I review writing samples."
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The blogging field is changing a little bit with many journalists becoming bloggers as part of their writing responsibilities with the magazine or newspaper they work for. However, many self-employed bloggers do start out on free blogging services and eventually migrate to their own web domains.

According to the Ning team on the Ning blog <A HREF="http://blog.ning.com/2007/03/tan_rested_and_ready.html">many people</A> have decided to create Ning social networks. Over 7,000 have already been created.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
What a week! We added 7,723 new social networks in the past four days. Wow! Here's a few of them. We've also gotten great ideas, feedback, and suggestions from the folks creating them. It's been fantastic, so thank you!
<BR><BR>
We worked through the night to make your networks on Ning faster than a speeding bullet. The issues folks saw with our database bug earlier in the week are resolved and, while something new can always show up, our servers are happy as clams under the current high load. God, I hope I didn't just jinx it by saying that :-)
<BR><BR>
In all seriousness, we've been up, stable, and fast for the past 18 hours and responding to issues within minutes. In total, we took Ning down for 3 hours over the past 4 days. We had intermittent slowdowns for an additional 6 hours. The benefit of monitoring absolutely everything is that we can tell you that we've had 97% uptime since our launch. Not too bad for the first week of a brand spanking new product.

Things look good for Ning in the early going. At a minimum they've created a popular social network hosting service. They are likely to face many new competitors later this year and on into 2008.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/freekarem.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Free Karem">Egyptian blogger Abdel Karim Suleiman was recently sentenced to four years in prison because of several posts he made on his blog. A Reuters <A HREF="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=internetNews&storyid=2007-02-22T130227Z_01_L22432925_RTRUKOC_0_US-EGYPT-BLOGGER.xml&src=rss&rpc=22">article</A> says Suleiman was convicted because his writings insulted both Islam and the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. A blog called <A HREF="http://freekareem.org/">Free Karem</A> has been documenting Karem's plight and linking to news stories covering his arrest. The blog also has a <A HREF="http://www.freekareem.org/kareem-faq/">very useful faq</A> that explains the situation. It also lists exactly what Karem was accused of by the Eygptian government.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
What did the Egyptian government accuse him of?<BR>
According to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, Kareem stands charged with the following alleged crimes: (1) Spreading data and malicious rumors that disrupt public security; (2) Defaming the President of Egypt; (3) Incitement to overthrow the regime upon hatred and contempt; (4) Incitement to hate "Islam" and breach of the public peace standards; (5) Highlighting inappropriate aspects that harm the reputation of Egypt and spreading them to the public.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
This certainly sets a bad precendent in Egypt. Free Karem says Karem's blog is located <A HREF="http://karam903.blogspot.com/">here</A> on blogspot.com. They also have been hosting blog rallies from the Free Karem blog.  You can see photographs <A HREF="http://www.freekareem.org/2007/02/01/report-on-the-rally/">here</A> from a rally held in New York City.  Some of the signs people are waving read "Shame on Egypt" and "Blogging is Not a Crime." 
<BR><BR>
Reporters Without Borders has also <A HREF="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=21075">crticized Egypt</A> for jailing Karem. They said, "It is time the international community took a stand on Egypt's repeated violations of press freedom and the rights of Internet users." Egypt is also on the Reporters Without Borders <A HREF="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19603">list of Internet enemies</A>.

The video news service will be run like it is has actually been around for 75 years. <I>The Onion's</I> <A HREF="http://www.theonion.com">website</A> often behaves in a similar manner. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
In late March, the company will launch The Onion News Network, a service that will stream original clips every week produced by a team of 15 new hires, including an entire production team. (That pushes the Onion empire to roughly 145 staffers.)
<BR><BR>
"Prepare for a news shit storm," says Mills.
<BR><BR>
Footage is based on the premise that the paper has been running a 24-hour news service for the past 75 years, only no one knew about it. Clips will cover the past seven decades, as well as current events. "We're not taking things we've done on the site or in print and applying video to them. This is its own enterprise," says Mills.
<BR><BR>
The Onion's dive into video production is one of many as traditional rags try to figure out how to survive in the digital world. Larger publishing empires have been scrambling for years to turn a profit on their web enterprises and are now taking a cue from YouTube by producing online videos they hope will boost ad revenue.
<BR><BR>
Despite laying off 100 employees last year, including high-ranking execs, publisher Time said this month that it would launch an in-house studio to help its 130 magazines develop online videos. Washingtonpost.com hopes that syndicating its multimedia content to other sites will increase ad revenue by broadening viewership.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
It is good to see a media company producing video content that understands the blogosphere and understands the traffic and promotional benefits of offering embedded video clips. If the videos are anything like the online articles they should be pretty amusing to watch.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Reuters hopes to draw from the 70,000 subscribers of its messaging service as a starting point for its foray into the fast-growing sector of community websites.  
<BR><BR>
"You will see us, later in the year, launch a version of MySpace for the financial services community," said the chief executive, Tom Glocer. "It won't have the latest hot videos and the 'why I am into Metallica and the Arctic Monkeys' blogs. Instead we are going to give our financial services users the ability to post their research or if they are traders, their trading models."
<BR><BR>
The website will also be exclusive to Reuters subscribers. "People don't want to have 100 friend requests from teenage girls in Florida if they are trading the credit derivatives market, but they probably are interested in being able to share research," said Mr Glocer.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/bbcyoutubechannel.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="BBC YouTube Channel">The BBC has cut a deal with YouTube. The story is reported <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6411017.stm">here</A> on the BBC news website. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Three YouTube channels - one for news and two for entertainment - will showcase short clips of BBC content.
<BR><BR>
The BBC hopes that the deal will help it reach YouTube's monthly audience of more than 70 million users and drive extra traffic to its own website. 
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
Two of the BBC's channels are already on YouTube: <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/BBC">BBC</A> and <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/user/bbcworldwide">BBC Worldwide</A>. The BBC will eventually offer news clips on YouTube when it launches a news channel later this year.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
BBC News: The news channel, which will be launched later this year, will show about 30 news clips per day. It will be advertising funded like a similar deal with Yahoo USA. BBC News is also offered to non-UK subscribers of Real Networks.
<BR><BR>
Because of the advertising, these clips can be seen outside the UK only. Any UK users clicking on a link to one of the news clips on YouTube will get a message that they have no access to this clip.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
It looks like the embedding feature has been disabled on the videos currently on the BBC YouTube channels which is unfortunate. It seems a little pointless to upload videos to YouTube and then disable embedding because disabling the embedding feature will limit the exposure and distribution of the videos. The BBC would get much more exposure to their videos if they let blogs ebmed the videos and show them to their readers. On the positive side at least the video content will be available in YouTube's video database. UK residents will not be able to see the videos due to a blackout requested by the BBC.

Dean and I are so excited that our official myspace page is set up. We have so many things to share with you. First of all, our baby boy is due at the end of March! I can't believe I have a whole month left considering I feel like I'm ready to pop. At this point in the game i'm getting very exhausted and a little uncomfortable. Not to mention my little man is an active one.I think he spends most of his day either kung fu fighting in my belly or having a mean game of of twister with his umbilical cord. But, we cannot wait to meet him! And, we have another baby being born in March...Our new B&B (bed and Breakfast). We took it over a little while ago and renovations are in full swing. It was an older colonial B&B in Temecula that we are turning modern and chic for our generation...and its of course run by us. Yes, you read correctly... Tori Spelling will actually make your bed and serve you muffins if you stay there.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/usersubmitter.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="User Submitter">Wired reporter Annalee Newitz has written a <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/internet/0,72832-0.html">story</A> (hat tip <A HREF="http://www.techmeme.com/070301/p43#a070301p43">Techmeme</A>) about buying votes on <A HREF="http://www.digg.com">Digg</A> with <A HREF="http://www.usersubmitter.com/">User/Submitter</A>.  Newitz says that buying votes helped her get a <A HREF="http://www.crowdhacking.com/blog/">blog</A> with pictures of crowds on Digg's front page. She created the blog just for this Digg experiment. If this blog had been more extensive and had more crowd photographs it may have been the kind of story that <A HREF="http://www.boingboing.com">Boing Boing</A> eventually picks up. 
<BR><BR>
Newitz posted the story on Digg with the headline, <A HREF="http://www.digg.com/design/Why_are_people_fascinated_by_photographs_of_crowds">Why Are People Fascinated By Photographs of Crowds?</A>.  But no one cared and after 4.5 hours Newitz's story just sat there with only the one initial digg. So Newitz turned to <A HREF="http://www.usersubmitter.com/">User/Submitter</A>, one of those pay for Digg votes services that isn't supposed to work. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Four and a half hours later, I was the only person who had dugg my story. That's when I hired a Digg-gaming service called User/Submitter, or U/S. This enterprise, run by one or more zealously anonymous individuals, advertises that it can help "submitters" get Digg stories noticed by paying "users" to digg them. There's a $20 sign-up fee and each digg costs $1, which gets split evenly between the service and the digger. U/S refunds money paid for any diggs the submitter doesn't get in a 48-hour period. I put down $450 for 430 diggs, but wound up getting refunded all but roughly $100 of that. (Wired News is owned by Cond�Net, which also owns Digg competitor reddit.)
<BR><BR>
If the corporate brass at Digg were right, this would be a complete waste of my money. CEO Jay Adelson told me before I conducted this experiment that all the groups trying to manipulate Digg "have failed," and that Digg "can tell when there are paid users." Adelson added, "When we identify a (Digg user) who is part of a scam, we don't remove their account so they don't realize they've been identified. Then we let them continue voting, but their votes may count a lot less. Then the scam doesn't work."
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The U/S service worked well enough that non-payed Digg users started getting interested in the story and digging it. Some clever Digg users didn't completely understand why there was so much interest in the story.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Ten hours after hiring U/S, I had 40 diggs. The vast majority of them had also dugg the Photoshop tutorial or the $35 offer. This was the moment when I reached a tipping point, and I began to get a lot of organic diggs and comments. The crowd on Digg is drawn to what's popular, and many of them second-guessed themselves when they checked out my blog and saw how crappy it was. Quomen commented, "None of those photographs really appeal to me. Am I defective? or just a loner."
<BR><BR>
Despite their doubts, Diggers kept digging my blog. There's a perverse incentive here: Diggers who vote early on stories that become wildly popular become more "reputable" in the Digg system. If you're trying to move up the Digg ranks, it's in your best interest to vote on anything that looks like it's gaining popularity. And my blog, with its flurry of paid votes, fit the pattern.
<BR><BR>
When I woke up in the morning, my story had been awarded the "became popular" tag and had 121 diggs. U/S had done what it promised: The company had helped me buy my way into Digg popularity, and my site traffic had gone way up -- overnight, I'd been hammered with so many hits that the diggers had to set up a mirror.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The story did become popular on Digg but eventually Digg users wised up and buried the story proving that crowds are both stupid and wise. They were dumb for digging the story in the first place because they thought it might be a cool story but they were eventually wise enough to bury it.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Ultimately, however, my story did get buried. If you search for it on Digg, you won't find it unless you check the box that says "also search for buried stories." This didn't happen because the Digg operators have brilliant algorithms, however -- it happened because many people in the Digg community recognized that my blog was stupid. Despite the fact that it was rapidly becoming popular, many commenters questioned my story's legitimacy. Digg's system works only so long as the crowds on Digg can be trusted.

Another interesting tidbit in Annalee Newitz's article is that she noticed a few other entries on Digg, including an advice article and a discount coupon, were getting dugg by the same people that were digging her blog about fascinating crowd photographs.

Michael Arrington at TechCrunch <A HREF="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/01/digg-should-sue-wired/">argues</A> that Digg should sue Wired over this story. Wired owns <A HREF="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</A>, a Digg competitor. Frantic Industries also <A HREF="http://franticindustries.com/blog/2007/03/01/wired-is-going-too-far-against-digg/">believes</A> <I>Wired</I> is going too far against Digg. It may be a negative story about Digg by a competitor but there doesn't appear to be anything inaccurate in Annalee Newitz. She also disclosed that <I>Wired's</I> parent company Conde Nast owns Reddit in her story. What would be unfair would be to tell <I>Wired</I> they can't report on one of the most popular Web 2.0 companies.

<IMG SRC="http://www.bloggersblog.com/pics/msnbcfirstperson.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="MSNBC FirstPerson">MSNBC.com has joined CNN, Reuters and The New York Times Co. in the hunt for the best user generated content. MSNBC.com's citizen journalism feature is called <A HREF="http://firstperson.msnbc.com/">FirstPerson</A>. One category of user submitted photographs and video they are looking for is Americana.
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2> 
Is there a quirky landmark in your town?  An unsung hero or an eccentric?  Do you frequent a little-known locale that has a claim to fame � or deserves one? We want to know about them. MSNBC.com will be featuring notable locations across the U.S., submitted by you. Send us photos and videos of the best-kept secrets in your area.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
They also want winter sports photos, vintage car photos, silly dog photos and stories about caring for an aging parent. A welcome to FirstPerson from Jennifer Sizemore, the editor in chief of MSNBC.com, can be found <A HREF="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16713129/">here</A>. MSNBC does not appear to be aggressively pursuing breaking news photos and videos from users like CNN is with its <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/exchange/">I-Reports</A> - at least not yet.
