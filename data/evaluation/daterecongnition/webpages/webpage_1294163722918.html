"In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit
the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to
live in a world that no longer exists."
--- Eric Hoffer

<hr />

An Western Canadian was visiting Montreal and was wandering through a park
with a local.  Suddenly a  strange bird scurried in front of
them.

Asked by the visitor what the bird was, the Quebecer replied, "That&#039;s a
bird of paradise."

The Western Canadian walked on in silence for a moment, then said,
"Long way from home, isn&#039;t it?"

goes to crooked gas buyers in San Antonio

Sent in by Deeli

<B>Not Neighborly</b>
SAN ANTONIO (UPI) -- A "pump malfunction" sold premium gasoline 
for 38 cents a gallon to crooked customers for several hours 
at a San Antonio convenience store, the manager says.

Jim Duke, manager of the Dill Food Mart, said he checked it out 
Thursday after watching an unusually large crowd gassing up 
at one particular pump Wednesday afternoon.

"I was inside and they were paying at the pump and nobody 
came in so nobody told me what was happening," Duke told WOAI-AM.

He found to his chagrin that "a decimal point had slipped" and 
instead of selling premium gas for $3.89 a gallon, the pump was 
dispensing it for 38 cents a gallon.

"We lost a lot of money," Duke said, although he wasn&#039;t sure yet
how much. Business was way down at that pump Thursday afternoon.

A man returned from a very fancy hospital and was telling his friend
all about his experience.

Man: The hospital I was in was very specialized.

Friend: How so ?

Man: They had a food nurse who gave you food. They had a drug nurse
who gave you drugs. They had a coffee nurse who gave you coffee.

Then there was the head nurse...

The old man was a witness in a burglary trial.The
defense lawyer asks Sam, "Did you see my client commit
this burglary?"

"Yes," said Sam , "I saw him plainly take the goods."

The lawyer asks Sam again, "Sam, this happened at
night. Are you sure you saw my client commit this
crime?"

"Yes" says Sam, "I saw him do it."

Then the lawyer asks Sam, "Sam listen, you are 80
years old and your eyesight probably is bad. Just
how far can you see at night?"

Sam says, "I can see the moon, how far is that?"

started a fight with the other two men. The police came
and took the drunk guy to jail.The next day the man
went before the judge. The judge asked the man, "Where
do you work?"


The man said, "Here and there."

The judge asked the man, "What do you do for a living?"

The man said, "This and that."

The judge then said, "Take him away."

The man said, "Wait, judge, when will I get out?"

Old man Zack had an incredible mule.  They had been together 
for years and stayed pretty much to themselves.  One day, Zack 
and his mule were walking down the road when a passerby asked 
if Zack needed a ride to town.  Zack accepted the offer and the 
driver asked, "What about your mule?" 

Zack said, "Oh, don&#039;t worry about him.  He&#039;ll keep up."  Then 
Zack got into the truck while his mule ran along behind. 

The driver was a little cruel and decided to speed up a little. 
The mule was right in back of them as they reached 55 mph. 
The driver accelerated and the mule and stayed with them. 
They reached 70 miles per hour and the mule was still right 
behind them.  The driver couldn&#039;t believe this.  He turned to 
Zack and said, "I&#039;m worried about your mule.  His tongue is 
hanging out." 

Zack said, "Which way?" 

The driver said, "Left." 

And Zack said, "Well, stay in this lane, he&#039;s about to pass."

During class, the chemistry professor was demonstrating the
properties of various acids. "Now I&#039;m going to drop this
silver coin into this glass of acid. Will it dissolve?"

"No sir," one student called out.

"No?" queried the professor. "Perhaps you can explain why
the silver won&#039;t dissolve in this particular acid."

"Because if it would, you wouldn&#039;t have dropped it in!"

goes to Belgian sports minister Michel Daerden

<B>Olympic drunk is sports minister</b>
A drunk fan of Olympic competitors from Belgium has been 
identified as the country&#039;s sports minister.

A loud Belgian fan had been shouting out during a doubles 
match between Argentinian and Belgian players.
Eventually Argentine tennis ace David Nalbandian 
lost his temper and told him to be quiet.

But other Belgian supporters recognised the "very drunk" 
man as sports minister Michel Daerden, media in the 
country have reported.

Daerden was also spotted drunk when cheering on the 
Belgian hockey team from the stands, say reports.
One Belgian fan, Marc Demeyer, said: "He was drunk 
as a skunk. It&#039;s an embarrassment for the nation."

Two American women stopping at the Hotel in Lisbon wanted
another chair in their room. The steward who answered their
ring could not understand English.

One of the women pointed to the only chair in the room, then
tried pantomime, seating herself in an imaginary chair.

With a knowing smile, the steward bowed and motioned for her
to follow him. At the end of the corridor, he stopped, smiled,
and bowed again, and pointed triumphantly to the door of the
Ladies Room.

<hr />

A doctor examined a woman and took her husband aside. "I don&#039;t
want to alarm you," he said, "but I don&#039;t like the way your
wife looks at all."

"Me neither, Doc." said the husband. "But she&#039;s a great cook
and real good with the kids."

Re: leave computer on at night?
<I>
Hi Webby,
I leave my computer on 24/7.  Should I turn it off at night? 
How much electricity is it using to keep it on? What is 
better for the machine.
 
Love your advice and daily newsletter and jokes. This is 
not the first time I have picked your brain and probably 
won&#039;t be the last!
Thanks Webby.

Dear Debby
Yes, it is much better to turn your computer off at night.
It saves electricity both directly and indirectly, since you 
don&#039;t need AC to get rid of the 500 Watts of heat it produces. 
So you actually save 1 KW per hour.

Turning it off also saves wear and tear on the hard drive.
Have FUN!

On the first day of school, the principal made his rounds, and 
heard a terrible commotion coming from one of the classrooms. 
He rushed in and spotted one boy, taller than the others, who 
seemed to be making the most noise.  He seized the lad, dragged 
him to the hall, and told him to wait there until he was excused. 

Returning to the classroom, the principal restored order and 
lectured the class for half an hour about the importance of 
good behavior.  When he was finished, he said, "Now, are 
there any questions?" 

One girl stood up timidly and said, "Please, sir, 
may we have our teacher back?"

Install a toilet paper roll holder on the edge of your craft
table to hold your crochet balls.  It makes it easy to dispense
yarn as your work on your project.  If you want to use more than
one color at the same time, you can install a more than one

The tiresome jury selection process continued, each side hotly 
contesting and dismissing potential jurors.  Another man was 
called for his question session. 

"Property holder?" 

"Yes, I am, Your Honor." 

"Married or single?" 

"Married for twenty years, Your Honor." 

"Formed or expressed an opinion?" 

"Not in twenty years, Your Honor."

Meetings are indispensable when you don&#039;t want to do anything. 
--- John Kenneth Galbraith

<hr />

A busload of new recruits arrived at the reception center, and was greeted
by an old drill sergeant. He began his speech: "Welcome to Fort Dix, men.
From now on, I want you to think of the Army as your family and as your
home."

Hearing this, one of the recruits broke formation, sat down and lit a
cigarette.

"Private, what on earth are you doing?" asked the sergeant.

"Well," said the private, "I&#039;m just making myself at home. Like you said,
this is my home."

Thinking fast, the sergeant said, "Son, you listen good, and you&#039;re right.
This is your home. So, as soon as you finish that cigarette, I want you to
report to the mess hall to help your mother with the dishes for the next 
two weeks."

goes to a burglar in Wichita, Kansas

Sent in by Ross

<B>Burglar flees in boxers, with jeans left in washer</b>
A Kansas burglar apparently likes to be clean - but isn&#039;t 
so good about clean getaways.

Police in Wichita say it appears a man broke into a house 
Friday night to wash his clothes but fled in boxers, with 
his jeans still in the washer.

Here&#039;s what happened: A woman reported that she returned 
home, found her basement laundry room in disarray and went 
upstairs to call her husband.

That&#039;s when a man wearing only blue boxer shorts came upstairs, 
grabbed her purse and ran out the door.

Police Sgt. Diane Varnell says the woman chased him and 
recovered her purse, but the burglar is still on the loose.

Every morning for years, at about 11:30, the telephone operator in a
small Sierra-Nevada town received a call from a man asking the exact
time. One day the operator summed up nerve enough to ask him why the
regularity.

"I&#039;m foreman of the local sawmill," he explained. "Every day I have to
blow the whistle at noon so I call you to get the exact time."

The operator giggled, "That&#039;s really funny," she said. "All this time
we&#039;ve been setting our clock by your whistle.

<hr />

A minister told his congregation, "Next week I plan to preach
about the sin of lying. To help you understand my sermon, I
want you all to read Mark 17."

The following Sunday, as he prepared to deliver his sermon,
the minister asked for a show of hands. He wanted to know
how many had read Mark 17.

Every hand went up.

The minister smiled and said, "Mark has only 16 chapters.
I will now proceed with my sermon on the sin of lying."

Re: IE crashing
<I>
Dear Webby
I run my machine as clean as fresh out of the box, but about
two or  three times a day, IE crashes. What is the cause of
that?
Harry
</i>
Dear Harry
the cause of that is sloppy programming. There is nothing
you can do about it. It happens to me too, and seems to be
related to some of the piece-meal bits of the SP3 that Microsoft
rams down our hard drives with the regular updates. I don&#039;t 
think they are purposely trying to poison XP, it seems to be
just routine klutziness.

Just use FireFox. If you visit exactly the same sites in the 
same time period with FireFox, there won&#039;t be a single 
browser crash.

For those sites that require IE, you can use Maxthon, the 
Chinese IE clone. It seems to be more stable than the 
original IE.

Have FUN!

<B>Organizing Baby Clothes</b>
Baby or toddler clothes often come in outfits, matching top and

together, fold them and put them in large zip-lock bags before
putting them away. You will be able to easily see the outfit and
the bags and be used over and over again.

 I have a friend who filled his car with gas at a self-service
 gas station. After he had paid and  driven away, he realized
 that he had left the gas cap on top of his car. He stopped and
 looked and, sure enough, it was lost.

 Well, he thought for a second and realized that other people
 must have done the same thing, and that it was worth going
 back to look by the side of the road since even if he couldn&#039;t
 find his own gas cap, he might be able to find one that fit. Sure
 enough, he hadn&#039;t been searching long when he found a gas cap. He
 tried it on, and it went into place with a satisfying click.

 "Great," he thought, "I lost my gas cap, but I found another one
 that fits.  And this one&#039;s even better, because it locks..."

"Do you see that couple? How devoted they are?
He kisses her every time they meet. Why don&#039;t you do that?"
"I would love to," replied the husband, "but I don&#039;t know
her well enough..."

goes to a school teacher in Haverfordwest, England

<B>Woman �tricked into sex� by penis cream treatment</b>
A Syrian-born airline pilot allegedly tricked a schoolteacher from 
Haverfordwest into having sex with him by pretending he had 
to administer ointment on the end of his penis, a jury heard Tuesday.

The teacher claims she put up with the treatment for nine 
months before telling her doctor.

Sbano was arrested at Heathrow while attending a pilots&#039; 
training facility. He claimed the woman had invented the entire 
story about the "treatment".

Sbano, from Harrow, London, denies nine charges of rape 
and 11 or obtaining money by deception.

During the trial, the prosecution had alleged that Syrian-born 
Mr Sbano fooled the woman into believing he could cure her 
herpes by having sex using cream.

He was also accused of deceiving both the woman and her 
mother into giving him thousands of pounds to buy the cream 
and to receive treatment for cancer.

The trial ended before Mr Sbano could give evidence, when
the judge halted it because "matters had come to light which 
would require more investigation".

A boy was smoking and leaving smoke rings into the air.
A girl standing next to him got irritated with the smoke
and said to the boy
"Can&#039;t you see the warning written on
the cigarette package, smoking may be bad for your health" ?

The boy replied: "I am a software engineer. we don&#039;t worry about
warnings, we only worry about errors"

 A wife is sitting in the living room watching TV, when all of a sudden
she hears her husband in the bedroom, swearing up a storm. He is using
every bad word in the book. The wife runs into the bedroom to see what
is going on. She finds her husband just sitting on the bed.

She asks her husband, "honey, what happened? Did you fall down and get
hurt or something?"

The husband looks up and replies, "no, I&#039;m fine. I&#039;m just practicing."

The wife gets a real confused look on her face, and said, "practicing?
Practicing for what?"

Then the husband says, "The company golf tournament tomorrow!"

Re: Save to CD
<I>
OK I give up......I have been trying to figure out how to file
to a CD.   I have lots of recipes on my hard drive that I need 
to remove to another file (a CD).   I have read the directions 
from the book that came with my computer....& I just can&#039;t 
figure out how to file to a CD.  I have Outlook Express and 
Word XP on computer.    There has got to be a simple
easy way to do this.    Can you help me?
Mary in FL
</i>
Dear Mary
First save those files to an easy to find location, for example
a desktop folder.

Then put a writable CD into the burner. After a few seconds
a File Explorer window will open, showing you the CD.
Squish that File explorer window to the side, so that you can
see it, and the desktop folder with the recipes.
Highlight the recipe folder, hold down CTRL, and drag it
to the File Explorer window that shows the CD.

Don&#039;t take the CD out yet!
Right-click in the File Explorer window and select "Write
these files to CD". They are just ready to be written, but
not completely nailed down yet. At this stage you can still
weed out stuff like thumbs.db and similar accidentally copied
but not needed files. After you click on "Write these files to CD",
it is too late. Then they are already burned onto the CD.

Once the burning has been completed, the CD tray usually
opens automatically. 

Have FUN!

A man is on his death bed with his wife by his side. In his faint,
dying breath he tells her that there are two times he suspects she
cheated on him and he would like to know the truth, the whole truth,
before he dies.

Rather hesitantly, she agrees to tell him everything ... the full truth.

"Well first," she begins, "remember when you lost your job and a week
later you got it back with a big raise?"

He slowly nods understandingly.

Then she tells him, "Do you remember when the IRS was going to do the
big audit on you and a week later they dropped the audit and gave us a
big refund instead?"

He again weakly nods in understanding.

Then he strains to ask, "Were there any more times that 
you cheated on me."

Even more hesitantly, she says "Yes dear. There was just 
one more time."

"Ohhhh," he sighs in agony. "You must tell me."

"Ok ... but only because you insist, dear," she stammers. 
"Remember the time when you were elected president of 
the golf club, but you were so sure you were going to lose 
by 23 votes?"

"Oh yes ... I remember," winced the dying old man. 
SUDDENLY, he shot up in his bed and exclaimed, 
"DAMN ... and I won by 45 votes!!"

A church had a man in the choir who couldn&#039;t sing. Several
people hinted to him that he could serve in other places,
but he continued to come to the choir.

The choir director became desperate and went to the priest.
"You&#039;ve got to get that man out of the choir," he said. "If
you don&#039;t, I&#039;m going to resign. The choir members are going
to quit too. Please do something."

So the priest went to the man and suggested, "Perhaps you
should leave the choir."

"Why should I get out of the choir?" he asked.

"Well, five or six people have told me you can&#039;t sing."

That&#039;s nothing," the man snorted. "Fifty people have told
me that you can&#039;t preach!"

Zoo: An excellent place to study the habits of human beings.
--- Evan Esar

<hr />

Thanks to Sandie for this story:
I was talking on the phone with my son, who was stationed in 
Hawaii with the Air Force. He was explaining how the troops 
were learning to scuba-dive. 

"We used the buddy system," he said, "and occasionally 
dived into shark-infested waters."

Listening on the extension, my daughter asked, "What do you 
do if you see a shark?"

My son said, "Swim faster than my buddy."

goes to Holly Highfield of Jacksonville, Florida

<B>Not safe to be let out in public</b>
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (UPI) -- Police in Jacksonville, Fla., 
said they arrested a woman who allegedly crashed two 
cars and hit a bicyclist before fleeing authorities in the nude. 

Holly Highfield allegedly struck a bicyclist intentionally 
with her SUV before stripping off her clothes and allegedly 
attempting to make a getaway in another vehicle, 
WJXT-TV, Jacksonville, Fla., reported Tuesday. 

Children who were in the SUV with Highfield prior to the 
incident said she pointed out the bicyclist before striking 
him with the vehicle. 

"Do you think this biker is going to get hit? Do you have 
faith? Are you afraid?" she allegedly asked the children 
before steering the vehicle to strike the cyclist. 

A couple riding in a van stopped to help the bicyclist, 
who was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, 
and police said Highfield jumped into the van and 
attempted to drive off but was foiled when the vehicle 
hit a nearby fence. 

Highfield, who police said appeared to be under the 
influence of drugs, was arrested and charged with 
battery, carjacking, driving under the influence while 
accompanied by a minor and DUI while causing 
damage to property.
Other charges may be added.

Thanks to Sandie for this story:
I was scheduled to fly from North Carolina to Germany, where 
my husband was stationed in the military. As I checked in at the 
airport, the ticket agent asked me some standard security 
questions.

"Has anyone given you any packages you didn&#039;t pack yourself?" he asked.

I told him that my mother-in-law had given me a parcel to take to her son.

He looked at me very carefully and slowly asked, 
"Your mother-in-law? Does she like you?
Maybe we better have some experts look at that package!"

<hr />

The census taker rang the doorbell and was quite surprised when the door
was opened by a nude woman.

"Don&#039;t be alarmed," she said, "I&#039;m a nudist."

Although somewhat embarrassed, the man proceeded to ask the routine
questions. When his asked, "How many children do you have?"

The lady replied, "Ten."

"Lady," he gasped, "you&#039;re not a nudist, you just don&#039;t have time to get
dressed!"

Dear Denise
Never heard of it.
Let the owner of that "known email address" tell you all about it.
Stuff like that I dump instantly.
If somebody is too lazy to tell me about it, 
but just wants to collect for finding yet another dumb sucker,
then they can stuff it where the sun don&#039;t shine.

Now they are probably sending out
"invitations" with your address forged in.

Yeah, I am an ornery old goat, but when it comes to weird sites,
that attitude comes in handy.

looked up and smiled. He exclaimed, "Doggoned it Maw, I done

Maw got up and looked over his shoulder at the
lines scrawled across the paper.  "What does it say?" Maw asked.

Two elderly people are living in a Florida mobile home park.
He&#039;s a widower and she&#039;s a widow. They&#039;ve known each other
for quite a number of years. One evening there&#039;s a community
supper and these two are at the same table. As the meal goes
on, he gives her a few admiring glances and finally gathers
up the gumption to ask her: "Will you marry me?"

After a few seconds of &#039;careful consideration,&#039; she smiles: "Yes,
 Yes, I will!"

Their meal ends and with a few more pleasant exchanges they return
to their respective residences.

Next morning, the old man is troubled. "Did she say &#039;yes&#039; or did she
say &#039;no&#039;?" He can&#039;t remember. Try as he will, he just can&#039;t bring it
back. With trepidation, he goes to the telephone and calls her. First,
he explains to her that he doesn&#039;t remember as well as he used to.
Then he reviews their lovely evening together. As he gains a little
more courage, he inquires, "When I asked if you would marry me, did
you say &#039;Yes&#039; or did you say &#039;No&#039;?"

To his great delight he hears her say "Why, I said, &#039;Yes, yes I will&#039;
and I meant it with all my heart." Then she continues, "And I am so
glad that you called, dear, because I couldn&#039;t remember who asked me!"

Thanks to Sandie for this story:
A bricklayer at my husband&#039;s construction job routinely 
complained about the contents of his lunch box. 
"I&#039;m sick and tired of getting the same old thing!" he shouted 
one day. "Tonight, I&#039;ll set my wife straight."

The next day, the men could hardly wait until lunchtime to 
hear what happened. 
"You bet I told her off," the bricklayer boasted. 
"I said, &#039;No more of the same old stuff. Be creative!&#039; 
We had one heck of a fight, but I got my point across."

He had indeed. In front of an admiring audience, he opened 
his lunch box to find that his wife had packed a coconut and 
a hammer.

He is now dating the sandwich girl from the Deli.

goes to Candy Klein, 37, of Rapid City, South Dakota

<B>Drunk driver asked deputy for help</b>

STURGIS, S.D. (UPI) -- An alleged drunken driver near Sturgis, S.D., 
stopped for directions at a residence that turned out to be the home 
of a sheriff&#039;s deputy, authorities said.

Meade County Sheriff Ron Merwin said Candy Klein, 37, became lost 
while allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol and stopped for 
directions at a home of a female sheriff&#039;s deputy, the Rapid City 
Journal reported.

Merwin said the deputy, whose name was not released, suspected 
Klein was intoxicated and refused to allow her to drive. He said the 
suspect then became enraged and attacked the deputy.

The sheriff said Klein was arrested and charged with felony driving 
under the influence and simple assault of a law enforcement officer. 
Suspect allegedly stole clothes to hide.

My sister had been ill, so I called to see how she was doing. 
My ten-year-old niece answered the phone &#039;Hello,&#039; she whispered. 
&#039;Hi, honey. How&#039;s your mother?&#039; I asked. 
&#039;She&#039;s sleeping,&#039; she answered, again in a whisper. 
&#039;Did she go to the doctor?&#039; I asked. 
&#039;Yes. She got some medicine,&#039; my niece said softly. 
&#039;Well, don&#039;t wake her up. Just tell her I called. What are you 
doing, by the way?&#039; 
Again in a soft whisper, she answered, &#039;Practicing my trumpet.&#039;

my son the question. &#039;Dad, I know that babies come from mommies&#039; 
tummies, but how do they get there in the first place?&#039; he asked innocently. 
After my son hemmed and hawed awhile, my grandson finally spoke up 
in disgust. &#039;You don&#039;t have to make something up, Dad. It&#039;s OK if you 
don&#039;t know the answer.&#039;

Re: Running programs on a removable drive
<I>
Dear Webby,
I have given up on CD&#039;s, as you say you can only rewrite a few times, 
found that a Attach� USB 2.0 Drive is just what I need.
Another question on this, could one down load QUICKEN on this and 
keep it off the main drive?
Roland
</i>
Dear Roland
Yes, sure.
Just select the E: drive as the drive to install it to.
When it is plugged in, it acts just like any other hard drive.
You can run any program, even the Operating System,
on any drive. 

Because most viruses and trojans look for the Windows
registry on the C: drive, I frequently partition the primary
hard drive into C: and E:, and put XP onto the E: drive.

Some programs need access to the Windows Registry to hide
their serial number and pass codes, but the bulk of the program,
and especially the data produced by it, can be on any drive.
Have FUN!

Thanks to Cookie for tis story:
My wife left the car unattended for only a minute, but it was 
long enough for our two-year-old to climb in, throw the car 
into reverse and crash into a lamppost. He was fine, but the 
car wasn&#039;t, and I had a hard time explaining who was behind 
the wheel to the insurance company. 

After a pause, the adjuster asked, &#039;Do you let him drive often?&#039;

A lunatic is sitting in his cell playing solitaire. Another
patient, who has been watching, suddenly cries,
"Wait a minute! I just caught you cheating yourself."
The first man puts his finger to his lips.
"Shhh," he whispers. "Don&#039;t tell anybody, but I&#039;ve been
cheating myself at solitaire for years."
"You don&#039;t say," says his surprised pal. "Don&#039;t you ever
catch yourself cheating?"
The first man shakes his head.
"Naw," he says proudly. "I&#039;m much too clever."

goes to Brendon Alan Erhardt, 39,

Sent in by Ross

<B>Australian man with rifle and 10lbs of pot caught 
driving over 90mph while taping himself masturbating </b>

Father of three Brendon Alan Erhardt, 39, told the court 
he was masturbating before being pulled over by police 
for driving over 90mph and recording himself on video 
as well. 

Erhardt -- who was disqualified from driving -- also told 
officers his act was "not dangerous&#039;&#039; as the "only person 
he could hurt was himself&#039;&#039;. 

In the car was a loaded .22 rifle, a cooler in the 
trunk containing over 10 pounds of cannabis, drug pipes, 
and a back seat with cannabis plants on it. 
The "visibly agitated" Erhardt said he planned on smoking 
it all at home in Noonamah, Australia.

He said the drugs were found at a rest stop, and that the 
rifle was for shooting kangaroos as he drove. 

Brendon Alan Erhardt, 39, was granted bail so he could marry 
his girlfriend of six months before he goes to jail.

Re: Storage media

Hi Webby,
I guess I&#039;m still in the dark ages.  I either save documents to 
my hard drive or to my A drive on a floppy.  I want to get more 
modern, but am not sure about CD&#039;s.  I know one can save 
information on a CD but can you write over it, such as to edit 
a document?
Thanks .......
Carol
</i>
Dear Carol
There ARE re-writabe CD&#039;s, but there is a limit to how often 
you can re-write them.
They tend to become useless without warning.

A much better solution is to buy a USB hard drive enclosure 
and stick a hard drive into it.
Quite often the drive from a retired machine is good enough 
for that.
You can also get brand new drives now at incredible bargains. 
I have seen 500 GB drives advertised for around $100. 
Check priceGrabber for a store near you.

You probably have a 20 or 40 GB drive now. Imagine the 
storage on a 250 GB or 500 GB drive!
Have FUN!

An aspiring young actor asked a young lady&#039;s father if he 
could have his daughter&#039;s hand in marriage. The father said, 
"I would never let my daughter marry an actor."

The actor said, "Sir, I think you may change your mind if you 
see me perform. Won&#039;t you at least come and see the play?"

So the father went to see the play, and the next day he called 
the actor, "You were right. I did change my mind. Go ahead 
and marry my daughter. You&#039;re no actor. Don&#039;t give up your
day job just yet!"

I was on a panel for prospective jury duty. The first lawyer 
questioning us began right off as an intimidating showman.

When he came to his question, "Do any of you here today 
dislike lawyers?"

Before the pause became too long, the judge announced, 
"I do."

<hr />

Advertising is the modern substitute for argument; 
its function is to make the worse appear the better.
--- George Santayana

<hr />

Thanks to Cookie for bringing back this Classic:

A new priest, born and raised in Texas, is nervous about hearing 
confessions, so he asks the older priest to sit in on his sessions.

The new priest hears a couple of confessions&#039; and  then the old 
priest asks him to step out of the confessional for a few suggestions.
 
The old priest suggests, &#039;Cross your arms over your 
chest, and rub your chin with one hand and try saying things like 
&#039;yes, I see,&#039; and &#039;yes, go on,&#039; and &#039;I understand.&#039;

The new priest crosses his arms, rubs his chin with  his hand 
and repeats all the suggested remarks to the old priest.
 
The old priest says, &#039;Now, don&#039;t you think that&#039;s a little better 
than slapping your knee and saying, &#039;No sh**... what happened next?&#039;

goes to Kirk Gossett in Gilbert, Arizona

<B>Too dumb to use an umbrella</b>
GILBERT, Ariz. (UPI) -- The insurer for an Arizona high 
school has rejected a father&#039;s claim for damages 
because this year&#039;s graduation ceremony was held in 
the rain. 

Kirk Gossett sought $400 from the Arizona School Risk 
Retention Trust for a sports coat he says was ruined while 
he watched his son graduate from Gilbert High School and 
for the cost of flying his daughter from Utah for the 
ceremony, The Arizona Republic reports. 

Insurance adjuster Thomas Mullen, in a letter rejecting 
the claim, said that the high school made a "good faith 
effort" to hold the ceremony and to do the best by its 
graduates and their families. While some schools in the 
area moved graduation indoors because of the 
unexpected, and, for Arizona, unusual, rain, Gilbert 
officials decided to go ahead with an outdoor ceremony. 

"The fact that it rained and caused some disruption and 
an abbreviated ceremony is unfortunate but does not 
create a liability," Mullen said. 

Assistant Gilbert Superintendent Clyde Dangerfield said 
the rain was the first he has seen on graduation day in 
15 years in the town. He said Gossett&#039;s claim was a first too.

I heard the dog barking before he and his owner actually 
barreled into our vet practice. Spotting a training video we 
sell, the owner wisely decided to buy one.

"How does this work?" she asked, handing me a check. 
"Do I just have him watch this?"

The world&#039;s first fully computerized airliner was ready for its maiden
flight without pilots or crew.

The plane taxied to the loading area automatically, its doors opened
automatically, the steps came out automatically.

The passengers boarded the plane and took their seats.

The steps retreated automatically, the doors closed, and the airplane
taxied toward the runway.

"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen," a computer voice intoned.

"Welcome to the debut of the world&#039;s first fully computerized airliner.
Everything on this aircraft is run electronically. Just sit back and relax.
Nothing can go wrong ... Nothing can go wrong...nothing can go wrong...."

Thank you for the info but is this Roboform for anyone such

they charge.

Dear Robert
Yes, RoboForm is 100% safe. 
I would not give them a link in the Humor Letter every day, 
if it was not perfectly safe. I have used it for many years, and 
would be totally lost without it.

And Yes, anybody can use Roboform.
The free version is for amateurs and small businesses, 
and they have a paid version for big business.
Both work fine and are easy to use.

You can get the <a href="http://webby.com/roboform">free version</a> at 
<a href="http://webby.com/roboform" target="_blank" >http://webby.com/roboform</a> or from my toolbox at <a href="http://webby.com/tools." target="_blank" >http://webby.com/tools.</a>

Dear Mom and Dad, 

We are having a great time here at Lake Typhoid.  Scoutmaster 
Webb is making us all write to our parents in case you saw the 
flood on TV and were worried.  We are okay.  Only 1 of our 
tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away.  Luckily, none of us 
drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for 
Chad when it happened.  Oh yes, please call Chad&#039;s mother and 
tell her he is okay.  He can&#039;t write because of the cast. 

I got to ride in one of the Search and Rescue jeeps.  It was 
neat.  We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn&#039;t 
been for the lightning.  Scoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad 
for going on a hike alone without telling anyone.  Chad said he 
did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn&#039;t 
hear him. 

Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow 
up?  The wet wood still didn&#039;t burn, but one of our tents did, 
also, some of our clothes.  John is going to look weird until his 
hair grows back. 

We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car 
fixed.  It wasn&#039;t his fault about the wreck.  The brakes worked 
just fine when we left.  Scoutmaster Webb said that when a car 
is that old, you have to expect something to break down; that&#039;s 
probably why he can&#039;t get insurance on it.  We think it&#039;s a neat 
car.  He doesn&#039;t care if we get it dirty, and if its hot, sometimes 
he lets us ride on the tailgate.  It gets pretty hot with 10 people 
in a car.  He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the 
highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. 

Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy.  Don&#039;t worry, he is a good 
driver.  In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive.  But he only 
lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn&#039;t any traffic. 
All we ever see up there are logging trucks. 

This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and 
swimming out in the lake.  Scoutmaster Webb wouldn&#039;t let me 
because I can&#039;t swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because 
of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake.  It was 
great.  You can still see some of the trees under the water from 
the flood.  Scoutmaster Webb isn&#039;t crabby like some scoutmasters. 
He didn&#039;t even get mad when we lost the life jackets.  He has to 
spend a lot of time working on the car, so we are trying not to 
cause him any trouble. He said next time he is going to steal
a much newer one.

Guess what?  We have all passed our first aid merit badges. 
When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how 
a tourniquet works.  Also Wade and I threw up. 

Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning 
from the leftover chicken.  I have to go now.  We are going into 
town to mail our letters and buy bullets and dynamite.  
Don&#039;t worry about anything.  We are fine. 

Love, Cole 

P.S.  How long has it been since I had a tetanus shot?

Thanks to Sandie for this story:
The other day, my wife and I got into some petty argument. 
(I say it was petty. She would say it was Armageddon). 
As is our nature, neither of us would admit the possibility, 
that we might be in error.

To her credit, she finally said, "Look, I&#039;ll tell you what. 
I&#039;ll admit I&#039;m wrong if you admit I was right."

"Fine," I said.

She took a deep breath, looked me in the eye and said, 
"I&#039;m wrong."

I grinned and replied, "You&#039;re right."

<B>Kodiak voters get Tagalog election pamphlets</b>
Many Kodiak residents were a bit confused when they received 
election pamphlets urging them to "Bumoto!" The pamphlets 
for four ballot initiatives being decided Aug. 26 weren&#039;t in 
English but in Tagalog, a language widely spoken in the 
Philippines.

An apparent mix-up at the printers was discovered when 
a resident called Alaska&#039;s Division of Elections looking for 
an English version.

Division of Elections spokeswoman Shelly Growden expects 
pamphlets printed in English to be in voters&#039; mailboxes 
shortly after the election. Meanwhile, both English and Tagalog 
versions of the pamphlet are available on the division&#039;s Web site:

A salesman, tired of his job, gave it up to become a policeman. 
Several months later, a friend asked him how he liked his new role.

"Well," he replied, "the pay is good and the hours aren&#039;t bad, 
but what I like best is that the customer is always wrong."

<hr />

A travelling salesman finds himself stranded in the tiniest town in
Australia.

He knocks on the door of a little hotel.

"Sorry, we don&#039;t have a spare room," says the manager, "but you&#039;re welcome
to share with a little red-headed schoolteacher, if that&#039;s okay."

"Oh, that&#039;ll be great," says the salesman, grinning from ear to ear. "And
don&#039;t worry, I&#039;ll be a real gentleman."

"Just as well," says the manager. "So will the little red-headed
schoolteacher."

Re: Powerpoint defaults
<I>
Dear Webby;
I have Open Office, as you suggest, and also power point, 
however when I open a PP type presentation it opens in 
Open Office and I would much prefer the PP presentation.  
How do I configure Open Office so PP is the "prefered" 
program for those presentations please without having to 
go to the F5 key..  Thanks as always for your help.

Dear Ann
By default, a.ppt file opens as an automatically running slide show,
pps opens as a working view with the thumbnails on the left and 
the big pictures on the right.

If you want a file to always open as a running slide show, 
just rename it&#039;s extension to ppt.
That doesn&#039;t change the file, it just tells programs how you 
want them to open that file.
Have FUN!

I can&#039;t say I&#039;ve ever gotten a shave from a barber, but I&#039;ve seen
others who have.  I was in a shop once, and an obviously new
barber nicked a customer several times while giving him a
shave.

The new man, in an effort to smooth things over asked
solicitously, "Do you want your head wrapped in a hot towel?"

"No thanks." said the customer.  "I&#039;ll carry it home under my
arm."

<B>Going to a New School</b>
If your kids are going to new school, take a tour of the campus
before school starts so they can get a feel for the layout. It
will make their first day of school much less stressful if they
know the lay of the land. Check with your school to see if they
offer an orientation for new students.

Our high school principal has each teacher report class
attendance over the intercom. The instructor must state the
number of students present by gender, for example, "I have
fourteen boys and thirteen girls in attendance."

One day our principal was more than a little miffed at
having to remind several teachers of the correct procedure.

He was apparently somewhat forgetful, too, when he checked
on the girls&#039; physical-education instructor. "I have twenty-
seven pupils present, sir," she announced. "Lady," he
shouted through the intercom, "I need sex!"

Success didn&#039;t spoil me, I&#039;ve always been insufferable.

You&#039;re in incredible shape," the doctor said. 
"How old did you say you are?" 

"I am seventy-eight," the man said proudly. 

"Seventy-eight!" the doctor exclaimed.  "That&#039;s great.  You 
look like a sixty year old.  How do you stay so healthy?" 

The old man explained, "Well, my wife and I made a pact when 
we got married.  Whenever she got mad she would go into the 
kitchen and cool off and I would go outside to settle down." 

"What does that have to do with it?" asked the doctor. 

And the old man said, "I&#039;ve pretty much lived an outdoor life."

goes to an Israeli couple currently in Paris

<B>&#039;Don&#039;t we have five children?&#039;</b>
Staff at an airport in Israel have found a three-year-old girl 
alone in a duty-free shop after her parents accidentally took 
a plane without her.

The parents boarded the flight to Paris from Ben Gurion 
Airport with four of their five children, reports the BBC.

The parents did not realise their mistake until the captain 
of the plane informed them after take-off, according to police.

The girl was put on the next flight to Paris. The parents will 
be questioned when they return to Israel.

"It is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage 
but not a child. This never happens," a police official said.

Some tourists in the Chicago Museum of Natural History 
were marveling at the dinosaur bones.  One of them asked 
the guard, "Can you tell me how old the dinosaur bones are?" 

The guard replied, "They are 3 million, 
four years, and six months old." 

"That&#039;s an awfully exact number," said the tourist. 
"How do you know their age so precisely?" 

The guard said, "Well, the dinosaur bones were 
three million years old when I started working 
here, and that was four and a half years ago."

I stopped at the local Burger King for a cold drink and was 
reading the menu over the counter.  I noticed a sign to the 
side that stated "Picture Menu Available".  I had to ask the 
clerk what it was for and she told me that they had a number 
of customers who couldn&#039;t read and they used that. 

Of course, I asked how they would know this picture 
menu was available and her answer was the classic, 
"Well, it says so on the sign, doesn&#039;t it?"

I have downloaded the MS links that are available

A young mother of a newborn girl announced to her husband, 
"I&#039;ve made up my mind.  We&#039;ll call our daughter Eulalia." 

The new father did not care for this choice at all, but he was 
a very tactful young man.  He said, "That&#039;s fine, honey.  The 
first girl I loved was named Eulalia, and it will evoke pleasant

The wife was silent for a moment, then said,

When ironing ribbons that are difficult to lay flat try holding

goes to Teah Limitone, 22, of Seminole, Florida

<B> Nude passenger leads to five-car crash</b>

SEMINOLE, Fla. (UPI) -- Authorities in Seminole, Fla., said a five-car 
wreck was caused by a motorist who was distracted by a naked 
woman changing clothes in her back seat.

Pinellas County sheriff&#039;s deputies said Teah Limitone, 22, 
was traveling north in the middle lane of Seminole Boulevard 
when she heard her changing passenger, Ayla Gabriel, make 
a distressed-sounding noise, the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times 
reported.

The deputies said Limitone turned her head to see if Gabriel 
was alright and ran a red light while she was not looking at
the nude Ayla instead of the road. 

Limitone&#039;s 2003 Acura struck a 2000 Saturn in the intersection 
before sliding between two cars in the southbound lanes and 
striking a fourth vehicle.

Deputies said Limitone was issued a citation for running a red 
light after the July 21 incident. No serious injuries were reported.

A modern Orthodox Jewish couple,
Preparing for a religious wedding
Meets with their rabbi for counseling.
 
The rabbi asks if they have any last questions before they leave. 
 
The man asks, 
"Rabbi, we realize it&#039;s tradition 
For men to dance with men, and
Women to dance with women at the reception.
 
But we&#039;d like your permission to dance together, like the rest of the
world.
 
"Absolutely not," says the rabbi. 
"It&#039;s immodest. 
Men and women always dance separately." 
 
"So after the ceremony 
I can&#039;t even dance with my own wife?" 
 
"No," answered the rabbi. 
"It&#039;s forbidden." 
 
"Well, okay," says the man, 
"What about sex? 
Can we finally have sex?" 
 
"Of course!" replies the rabbi. 
"Sex is a mitzvah a good thing within marriage, 
To have children!" 
 
"What about different positions?" 
Asks the man 
 
"No problem," says the rabbi 
"It&#039;s a mitzvah!" 
 
"Woman on top?" the man asks. 
 
"Sure," says the rabbi. 
"Go for it! It&#039;s a mitzvah!" 
 
 "Doggy style?" 
 
"Sure! Another mitzvah!" 
 
"On the kitchen table?" 
 
"Yes, yes! A mitzvah!" 
 
 "Can we do it on rubber sheets 
With a bottle of hot oil, 
A couple of vibrators, 
A leather harness, 
A bucket of honey and a porno video?" 
 
 "You may indeed. It&#039;s all a mitzvah!" 
 
 "Can we do it standing up?" 
 
 "No." says the rabbi." 
 
 "Why not?" asks the man. 
 
"Could lead to dancing!"

Morty and Saul, are out one afternoon on a lake
when their boat starts sinking.

Saul the banker says to Morty, "So listen, Morty, you
know I don&#039;t swim so well."

Morty remembered how to carry another swimmer from his
lifeguard class when he was just a kid. So Morty is begins
tugging Saul toward shore. After twenty minutes, he begins
to tire.

Finally about 50 feet from shore, Morty asks Saul,

"So Saul, do you suppose you could float alone?"

Saul replies, "Morty, this is a hell of a time to be asking
for money!"

The priest was instructing a class of third-graders at All
Saints grammar school. "There were two brothers, and one of
them chose the wicked path of Satan. The brother was evil
and corrupt and did great damage to many people, and wound
up a convicted criminal.

"But the other brother studied hard and became a successful,
knowledgeable lawyer. "Now, children, what is the difference
between these two brothers, who both started out in the same
place?"

Little Johnny raised his hand and said, "Easy. One of them

goes to 26 teen cheerleaders in Texas

<B>26 teen cheerleaders rescued from elevator</b>
How many cheerleaders can cram into an elevator? Apparently 
not 26. A group of teenage girls attending a cheerleading camp 
on the University of Texas got stuck and had to be rescued 
after trying to squeeze into an elevator at a residence hall 
Tuesday night.

One girl fainted and was treated at a hospital and released. 
Two others were treated at the scene.

The elevator doors refused to open after the pack of 14- to 
17-year-olds descended from the fourth to the first floor, 
police said. Responding to a few panicked cell phone calls 
from the group, police and firefighters summoned an 
elevator repairman, who spent about 25 minutes extricating 
them.

Campus officials weren&#039;t amused.
"It&#039;s dangerous, actually," said a school police spokeswoman, 
Rhonda Weldon. "They&#039;re lucky that that&#039;s all that happened."

Little Johnny had bought Grandma a book for her birthday and wanted to
write a suitable inscription. He racked his brain until suddenly he
remembered that his father had a book with an inscription of which he was
very proud, so Johnny decided to copy it. You can imagine Grandma&#039;s
surprise when she opened her book, a Bible, and found neatly inscribed the
following phrase: "To Grandma, with the compliments of the author."

There was this gracious lady mailing an old family Bible to her brother in

"Is there anything breakable in here?" asked the postal clerk. "Only the
Ten Commandments," answered the lady.

Re: IE7 latest version

I had a good laugh today. 

Emails from from "admin@microsoft.com", not asking me to
stop pointing out Vista problems, but inviting me to download
the latest version of IE7 !

DUH! I use and recommend the IE7 BLOCKER. Why would I want
to download the latest version of a program that I am blocking?

MailWasher flagged them as spam, but the sender name 
caught my eye.

Closer inspection revealed that the sender address was
From: "admin@microsoft.com" <humor@webby.com> 
That was what had triggered MailWasher.

The download link didn&#039;t go to Microsoft either. It went to
dariocondes.iespana.es/images/update.exe
The site appears to be a juvenile dating site, that allows
members to upload their images, or vicious trojans.
They are too dumb to restrict uploads to JPG or GIF.

If you see ANY solicitation to update or upgrade, dump it.
When you do want an update, use a fresh browser window
and go straight to the vendor&#039;s site by typing it into the
address bar. Don&#039;t jump there from a link.

As I left the grocery store, I noticed two little kids, maybe 
six or seven years old, selling candy bars in front of the 
store to raise money for their school band.

"I&#039;ll buy a chocolate bar on one condition," I said to the boys. 
"You eat it for me."

I bought one and handed the candy back to one of the boys. 
He shook his head. "I can&#039;t," he said.

"Why not?"

Looking me in the eye, he responded gravely, 
"I&#039;m not supposed to take candy from strangers."

There are only two kinds of scholars;

Thanks to Dianne for bringing back this classic:
As  the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she 
became aware that her leather skirt was too tight to allow 
her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus.

 Slightly  embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus
 driver,  she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little,
 thinking  that this would give her enough slack to raise 
 her leg. She tried  to take  the step, only to discover that 
 she couldn&#039;t.

 So,  a little more embarrassed, she once again reached
 behind  her to unzip her skirt a little more, and for the
 second  time attempted the step.

Once  again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise 
her leg. With a little  smile  to the driver, she again reached 
behind to unzip a little more and  again was unable to take 
the step.

 About this  time, a large Texan who was standing
 behind her  picked her up easily by the waist
 and  placed her gently on the step of the bus.

 She  went ballistic and turned to the would-be  Samaritan
 and screamed,  &#039;How  dare you touch my body!
 I  don&#039;t even know who you are!&#039;

 The Texan smiled  and drawled,
 &#039;Well,  ma&#039;am, normally I would agree with you,

 but  after you unzipped  my fly three times,
 I  kinda figured we  was friends.&#039;

goes to Jomo Sexton, 34 of Salinas, California

<B>Car thief turned in car jacker</b>

SALINAS, Calif. (UPI) -- Police said a Salinas, Calif., man 
stole a Chevy pickup truck only hours before the vehicle 
was taken from him at gunpoint. 

Police Cmdr. Kelly McMillin said Edward Bishop, 33, complained 
to police that after he stole the Chevrolet Silverado truck at about 
1 a.m. Saturday,  that later that day, another man, -- identified by 
police as Jomo Sexton, 34 -- entered the truck and pointed a gun 
at him. He told police Sexton made him drive around Salinas. 
When the truck ran out of gas, Jomo told Bishop to push the truck,
at which point Bishop said he escaped and phoned police. 

Bishop was arrested on suspicion of vehicle theft and booked 
into the Monterey County Jail. 

Jomo Sexton was taken to a hospital for treatment after crashing 
the stolen truck into a flag pole in front of Salinas Fire Station II the 
next day, and was then released into police custody. He was 
arrested on suspicion of kidnapping, carjacking, reckless driving, 
driving under the influence, unlicensed driving, hit and run 
and violating his parole. 

"You couldn&#039;t make up something stranger than this," McMillin said.

A woman with a baby came into the doctor&#039;s office. She was told
to go into a room and wait for the doctor.

After arriving, the doctor examined the baby and asked the woman,
"Is he breast fed or on the bottle?"

"Breast fed" she replied.

"Well, strip down to your waist,"the doctor ordered.

She did.

He pressed, kneaded and pinched both breasts for a while in a
detailed examination. Motioning to her to get dressed he said,
"No wonder this baby is hungry. You don&#039;t have any milk."

"Naturally," she said, "I&#039;m his Grandma. But I&#039;m glad I came."

<hr />

An Amish boy and his father were visiting a mall. They were 
amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two 
shiny, silver walls that could move apart and back together again.

The boy asked his father, "What is this, Father?" 

The father [never having seen an elevator] responded 
"Son, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I don&#039;t 
know what it is."

While the boy and his father were watching wide-eyed, an 
old lady in a wheel chair rolled up to the moving walls and 
pressed a button. The walls opened and the lady rolled between 
them into a small room.

The walls closed and the boy and his father watched small 
circles of lights with numbers above the walls light up. They 
continued to watch the circles light up in the reverse direction.

The walls opened up again and a beautiful 24-year-old woman 
stepped out. The father said to his son, "Go get your mother."

Re: CrapCleaner and passwords

Webby, I notice when I use Crap Cleaner, it wipes out all the 
passwords I have used before. Will it do that to Robo Form too
if I download it?

Dear Carolyn
You can check and uncheck a whole bunch of stuff in CrapCleaner.
If you have a checkmark on Cookies, then of course all those
passwords, that are held in cookies, are dumped.

I don&#039;t use a checkmark on cookies.

CrapCleaner does not interfere or mess with RoboForm at all. 
Roboform stores it&#039;s stuff securely encrypted in a special place, 
not in cookies.

The only difference between a rut and a grave is their dimensions.

<hr />

A guy wanted to get in the temple on Yom Kippur, but without a
ticket they don&#039;t let you in on the Jewish high holidays.
He said, "Look, I have to give an emergency message to a
doctor friend in there."

The guy at the door says, "Sorry, you got to have a ticket."

The first guy replies, "Just let me in for one minute, I&#039;ll give the doctor
the message and then I&#039;ll be right out."

"All right," says the guy at the door, "but I better not catch you
praying."

goes to US organized labor, all the big unions in the US.

Sent in by Jolie

<B>US Organized Labor too chicken to defend Labor Day</b>

When a noisy Islam minority at Tyson foods in Shelbyville, Tennessee
wanted a paid Muslim holiday in exchange for Labor Day, 
Tyson agreed.

They didn&#039;t give up MLK day, or President&#039;s day, 
but LABOR day, 
the day legislated in the 1880s to honor ALL workers!

And what did organized labor, all the big unions, do about
having THEIR day trashed and replaced by a Muslim holiday?

Apparently it wouldn&#039;t be demoohcratic and might upset Obama,
if the big unions made a ruckus defending their day. So they
meekly chickened out and pretended it did not happen.

Independence day is next.

<a href="http://www.onenewsnow.com/Business/Default.aspx?id=204060" target="_blank" >http://www.onenewsnow.com/Business/Defa ... ?id=204060</a>

If Labor Day is taken away from you in your town, you are
most welcome to come to Canada and celebrate Labor Day here.
On Labor Day.

"And will there be anything else, Ma&#039;am?" the bellboy asked 
after setting out an elaborate dinner for two.

"No, thank you," the lady replied. "That will be all."

As the young man turned to leave, he noticed silk pajamas on
the chair by the bed. "Anything for your husband?" he asked.

"Nah," the lady said. "I&#039;ll pick up a postcard for him in the morning."

<hr />

Some race horses staying in a stable. One of them starts to boast
about his track record. "In the last 16 races, I&#039;ve won 8 of them!"

Another horse breaks in, "Well in the last 27 races, I&#039;ve won
20!!"

"Oh that&#039;s good, but in the last 37 races, I&#039;ve won 29!" says
another, flicking his tail.

At this point, they notice that a greyhound dog has been sitting

"I don&#039;t mean to boast," says the greyhound, "but in my last 91
races, I&#039;ve won 89 of them!"

The horses are clearly amazed. "Daaaaaaaamn!" says one, after a
hushed silence.

"A talking dog!"

Although this married couple enjoyed their new fishing boat
together, it was the husband who was behind the wheel
operating the boat. He was concerned about what might happen
in an emergency. So one day out on the lake he said to his
wife, "Please take the wheel, dear. Pretend that I am having
a heart attack. You must get the boat safely to shore and
dock it."

So she steered the boat to shore and docked it.

Later that evening, the wife walked into the living room where
her husband was watching television. She sat down next to him,
switched the TV channel, and said to him, "Please go into the
kitchen, dear. Pretend I&#039;m having a heart attack and set the
table, cook dinner and wash the dishes."

<B>Frugal Toys - Squirt Bottles</b>
Water fights can be a lot of fun in the summer time. Squirt
bottles and spray bottles for dish soap or hand soap that are
thoroughly cleaned can make great water guns for small children.
Fill up some water balloons as well and let the games begin.

<hr />

After 4 years of separation, my wife and I finally divorced
amicably. I wanted to date again, but I had no idea of how
to start, so I decided to look in the personals column of
the local newspaper. After reading through all the listings,
I circled three ads that seemed possible in terms of age and
interest, but I put off calling them.

Two days later, there was a message on my answering machine
from my ex-wife. "I came over to your house to borrow some
tools today and saw the ads you circled in the paper. Don&#039;t
waste your time with the one in the second column. It&#039;s me."

It takes hundreds of nuts to hold a car together, 
but it takes only one of them to scatter it all over the highway.
--- Evan Esar,

<hr />

A kind-hearted fellow was walking through Central Park in New
York and was astonished to see an old man, fishing rod in hand,
fishing over a beautiful bed of red roses.

"Tsk Tsk!" said the passerby to himself. "What a sad sight.  That
poor old man is fishing over a bed of flowers. I&#039;ll see if I can
help." So the kind fellow walked up to the old man and asked,
"What are you doing, my friend?"

"Fishin&#039;, sir."

"Fishin&#039;, eh. Well how would you like to come have a drink with
me?"

The old man stood, put his rod away and followed the kind stranger
to the corner bar. He ordered a large glass of vodka and a fine
cigar.

His host, the kind fellow, felt good about helping the old man,
and he asked, "Tell me, old friend, how many did you catch today
?"

The old fellow took a long drag on the cigar, blew a careful
smoke ring and replied, "You are the sixth today, sir!"

goes to the Virginia DMV and Geralynn Banks

<B>Government con-artists?</b>
PORTSMOUTH, Va. (UPI) -- A Portsmouth, Va., woman said she 
is being sued by the state for $75,000 after she backed into 
another car during a Department of Motor Vehicles road test. 

Antoinette Bowser said she learned recently -- two years after 
the failed road test -- that the state expects her to pay the fine 
to cover the medical expenses and lost wages of the DMV 
employee administering the test, The (Norfolk, Va.) 
Virginian-Pilot reported. 

The state&#039;s lawsuit claims Bowser hit the car with such 
"force and violence" that the employee, Geralynn Banks, 
suffered "great pain of body and mind." 

However, Bowser said she recalls the accident as a minor 
fender-bender. 

"I know I walked away. And I know she walked away," she 
told the newspaper. 

Bowser, who has yet to get her driver&#039;s license, said she 
doesn&#039;t know how she could afford to pay the fine. 
"I don&#039;t have $75,000 laying around," Bowser said to The Virginian-Pilot.

Normally instructors and testers are responsible for the
actions and results of their clients, and their insurance
covers it all. 

Personally, when I see "great pain of body and mind." due to
a minor fender bender, my BS detector beeps.

A woman went to a discount store to purchase several items. When she
finally got to the checker, she learned one of her items had no price.

She thought she&#039;d die of embarrassment when the checker got on the
intercom and boomed out for all the store to hear, "Price check on lane
thirteen.  Tampax. Supersize." 

As if that wasn&#039;t bad enough, the person looking for the price 
misunderstood  the word "Tampax" for "Thumbtacks." 

In a businesslike tone, a voice boomed back over the intercom, 
"Do you want the kind you push in with your thumb or the kind
you pound in with a hammer?"

<hr />

Thanks to Bri for this one:
My boyfriend and I were at my son&#039;s volleyball game when we 
noticed an adult couple in the bleachers.  
They were being VERY affectionate.

She was running her hands all over him and nibbling on
his ear.  He had his hands on her chest.

I said to my boyfriend, "I don&#039;t know whether to watch
them or the game."

He said, "Watch THEM!  
You already KNOW how to play volleyball...."

Dear EE
It is real, though not very common in NorthAmerica yet.
So far it seems to be confined mostly to Europe.

If some site tells you that you need to update your flash 
player to see what they got, don&#039;t click on anything, just
get out of there fast, before you get skunked with trojans
and back-doors.

If you think your Flash player needs to be updated or 
upgraded, close all browser windows, open a new one
and go straight to <a href="http://adobe.com" target="_blank" >http://adobe.com</a>, click on Downloads
and select Flash Player.

The same advice of course also goes for update nudges
for other programs, like Media Player. 
Always go to the real and legitimate source.
Have FUN!

A farmer called my veterinary office and asked me to make 
a house call. Because the road was closed, he parked his 
ancient pickup in a field for me to drive the rest of the way. 
But once behind the wheel, I realized the brakes didn&#039;t work. 
The truck sped toward the stable, across the farmyard, 
into the barn, and embedded itself in a gigantic haystack. 

Sweating, I climbed out and apologized. 
"Don&#039;t worry," the farmer said to me. 
"That&#039;s how I stop the truck too."

A little boy got lost at the YWCA and found himself in the

Ability will never catch up with the demand for it.
--- Malcolm Forbes

<hr />

The passenger tapped the cab driver on the shoulder to
ask him something. The driver screamed, lost control of
the car, nearly hit a bus, went up on the sidewalk, and
stopped centimeters from a shop window.

For a second everything went quiet in the cab, then the
driver said, "Look mister, don&#039;t ever do that again.
You scared the daylights out of me!"

The passenger apologized and said he didn&#039;t realize
that a little tap could scare him so much.

The driver replied, "You&#039;re right. I&#039;m sorry it&#039;s not
really your fault. Today is my first day as a cab
driver. I&#039;ve been driving a hearse for the last 25
years".

goes to Minneapolis, MN police chief
Sent in by Judy

<B>Rewards for raiding wrong house</b>
Here is another example of "police doing wrong" and being 
rewarded for it. Last Dec. an informant gave the wrong address 
to the Minneapolis police department. If they had looked up the 
address in the reverse phone directory they would have found 
that the last name of the owner of the house was not who they 
were looking for, or even the correct race, but they broke 
into the house any way. The owner thought it was a burglar 
so he fired his gun, the police returned the fire. 

The police department had a ceremony for the police involved 
and gave each a reward for their botched entry.

Nobody has been disciplined for not checking the address
and raiding the wrong house.

A young couple took their three-year-old son to
doctor Cohen. With some hesitation, they explained
that, although their little angel appeared to be in good
health, they were concerned about his rather small penis.

After examining the child, the doctor confidently
declared, "Just feed him bagels with cream cheese. That should
solve the problem."

The next morning, when ! the boy arrived at breakfast,
there was a huge stack of warm bagels and cream cheese in the
middle of the table.

"Gee, mom," the boy exclaimed. "For me?"

"Just take two," his mother replied.

"The rest are for your father."

<hr />

One day a co-worker told my friend, Stan, that she was
going home early because she didn&#039;t feel well. Since
Stan was just getting over something himself, he
wished her well and said he hoped it wasn&#039;t something
he had given her.

A fellow worker piped up, "I sure hope not. She has morning
sickness."

A 16-year-old girl bought herself a very tiny bikini. Very
proud, she came home and put it on. She then showed her
mother how she looked in it.

"What do you think mom?" she asked.

Her mother replied, "If I wore that when I was your age, you
would be 5 years older."

<B>Flip Your Mattress</b>
Get into the habit of flipping and rotating your mattress once a
month. This will prevent one side from being worn down more than
another.  Futon mattresses should also be folded, flipped and
rotated regularly.  Note, some mattresses aren&#039;t designed to be
flipped, but can still be rotated.

goes to Patrick Pogan of the New York Police Department

<B>Rookie cop gave dubious account of his bicyclist assault</b>
<a href="http://snipurl.com/3abr8" target="_blank" >http://snipurl.com/3abr8</a>

JULY 29--You may have seen that YouTube video of the New York 
cop viciously knocking down a bicyclist in Times Square last week. 
Officer Patrick Pogan&#039;s blindside hit on Christopher Long led NYPD 
brass yesterday to strip the rookie cop of his gun and badge pending 
a department probe. That review will surely focus on the 22-year-old 
Pogan&#039;s sworn account of the takedown, which led to Manhattan 
prosecutors filing three misdemeanor charges against the 
29-year-old Long, who was participating in a monthly bike ride 
organized by transportation activists. n the Criminal Court complaint 
filed against Long (who spent 26 hours in jail after his arrest Friday 
night), Pogan offered a fantastical version of the incident. Pogan 
claimed that Long drove his bicycle directly into him, knocking the 
cop to the ground and causing "lacerations on deponent&#039;s forearm." 
The video, of course, shows Pogan delivering a blow that would have 
made former Oakland Raider Jack Tatum proud.

The trumped up charges are at "The Smoking Gun":

"It sure does," he replied.

Little Johnny has been bringing his drawings home from kindergarten everyday
since he started a month ago. Each day his mother admires the pictures and
hangs them on the refrigerator. One thing starts bothering her though.
Little Johnny only uses black and browns for his drawings. Fearing a problem
with her young son and not wanting to make it worse, she decides to take him
to a child psychologist.

The psychologist delicately goes to work. He gives Johnny a battery of
psychological tests. He chats with Johnny. Everything seems perfectly
normal. Everyday for two weeks, the tests continue. Yet everyday, little
Johnny continues to bring home drawings in only black and brown. Frustrated
at not being able to get to the root of the problem and fearful that
something is terrible wrong, the child psychologist decides to give little
Johnny some paper and a box of crayons and observe what happens.

Little Johnny opens the box of crayons and says "oh boy! A new box of
crayons! At school we only have old boxes. The only ones left in mine are
black and brown!"

A wealthy old man looked around the table at his two sons and five
daughters and their spouses gathered for a family reunion.

"Not a single grandchild," he said with a sigh. "Why, I&#039;ll give a million
dollars to the first kid who presents me with a little one to bounce on my
knee. Now, let&#039;s say grace."

When the old man lifted his eyes again, his wife was the only other person

A lawyer and an engineer were fishing in the Caribbean. 
The lawyer said, "I&#039;m here because my house burned down, 
and everything I owned was destroyed by the fire. 
The insurance company paid for everything."

"That&#039;s quite a coincidence," said the engineer. 
"I&#039;m here because my house and all my belongings were

for everything." 

The lawyer puzzled asked, "How do you start a flood?"

Good judgment comes from experience, 
and experience comes from bad judgment.
--- Barry LePatner

Reality is the leading cause of stress amongst those in touch with it.
-- Jane Wagner 

�Obama was in Germany [last week], and a lot of people showed up. 
There was so many Germans shouting and screaming insults and 
obscenities, that France surrendered again.�

It&#039;s forty below zero one winter night in Alaska.  Pat is 
drinking at his local saloon and the bartender says to him, 
"You owe me quite a bit on your tab." 

"Sorry," says Pat, "I&#039;m flat broke this week." 

"That&#039;s okay," says the bartender.  "I&#039;ll just write your 
name and the amount you owe me right here on the wall." 

Pat says, "But, I don&#039;t want any of my friends to see that." 

"They won&#039;t," says the bartender. "I&#039;ll just 
hang your parka over it until it&#039;s paid."

goes to Best Solicitors law firm in Sheffield, England

<B>Divorce letter was mistake</b>
A happily married couple were stunned to receive a lawyer&#039;s 
letter saying their divorce had been finalised.

John Kitteridge, 65, and wife Joan have been married for 
36 years, reports the Sheffield Star.

Joan, 59, who burst into tears when she read the letter said: 
"I couldn&#039;t believe what I was reading. I knew deep down it 
couldn&#039;t be true but it was still such a shock.

"We&#039;ve had our ups and downs like any couple! But we&#039;d never 
get divorced."

Security guard John had been working nights and was in bed 
when the post arrived.

He said: "If it had been an old lady or an elderly man who 
had received it, they could have suffered a heart attack. 
How does a mistake like that even happen?

"We dealt with the same solicitors three years ago on an 
unrelated legal matter, but everything should be on 
computers these days so it must have shown up that we 
weren&#039;t getting a divorce."

Sheffield-based Best Solicitors apologised and said the 
mistake had been made after a standard template letter 
was sent to the Kitteridges.

They said details inside the letter, referring to divorce, 
should have been changed but had been missed.

Deciding to take up jogging, James was astounded by
the wide selection of jogging shoes available at the
local sports shoe store. While trying on a basic pair
of jogging shoe, he noticed a minor feature and asked
the clerk about it.

"What&#039;s this little pocket thing here on the side for?"

"Oh, that&#039;s for cab fare home, when you&#039;ve jogged too far."

Re: How to tell that your computer is infected
<i>
Dear Webby,
Sorry to be a pest here with my 76 yr old gray cells!  It&#039;s a 
subject that&#039;s come up before by other readers and I&#039;ve 
wondered, but never asked.  
 
Regarding today&#039;s "Tech Pits" item: how in the world does 
one determine they have been infected with something 
(let alone know what it is!) if none of their programs can 
detect it?!

Dear Vickster
If you have unexpected pop-ups or slow-downs,
and see weird stuff in the Task Manager (CTRL ALT DEL),
then you check what that weird stuff is about.

It would probably be a good idea if you had a look at your 
task manager, and maybe even print it out. That way you can 
compare it if you suspect a problem.
Have FUN!

Get this." said a guy to his friends, "Last night, while I was
down at the bar with you guys, a burglar broke into my house.

"Did he get anything?" his friends asked.

The guy said, "Yeah, a broken jaw, six teeth knocked out, 
and a pair of  broken ribs."  
 
One of his friends ask, "Whoa! But...how???"
 
The guy answered, "Well, it was really late at night and 
my wife thought it was me coming home drunk!"

<B>Rolling Existing Car Loans Into a New Car Purchase</b>
Don&#039;t buy a new car if you haven&#039;t paid off your old one, unless
you have equity accumulated. Dealers roll the existing loan into
the new car financing, owing more than the car is worth. This is
a bad situation for the borrower but a good one for the dealer.

"Only a little," she answered.

with your surrogate mother and here&#039;s your sperm donor and
your father&#039;s clone. This is me holding you when you were
just a frozen embryo.

The lady with the very troubled look on her face is your

goes to a 25 year old woman in New York

<B>Too dumb to dress herself</b>

New York - Metro New York
When a 25-year-old Manhattan graduate student who was assaulted 
Tuesday night got dressed that morning, she probably didn&#039;t 
anticipate that her T-shirt would provoke four teens into shoving her, 
pulling out her earphones and spitting in her face. 

Then again, with a shirt sporting the slogan, "Obama is my slave," 
it may have been wise to consider the possibility. 

Now she&#039;s suing the $69 shirt&#039;s "designer" for "all he&#039;s got," the designer claims. 
But the Israeli-born "designer" says what allegedly happened to his now-disgruntled 
customer isn&#039;t his fault and that his outrageous design reflects not his views but 
those of "ordinary WASPs." 

"For a lot of people, when they see Obama, they see a slave. People think 
America is not ready for a black president," the "designer", a recent
immigrant from Israel, said. 

The "designer" claims that after the customer threatened to sue, he contacted 
his own lawyer, who assured him he was shielded by the First Amendment 
from any legal action. 

The ugly incident over the ugly shirt took place at 8:30 p.m. in Union Square 
when four African-American female teenagers accosted the student, 
cursed at her for her shirt and pushed her. The student walked away, 
but the girls followed her, one pulling the earphones out of her ears, 
another spitting in her face. 

-----------
Personally, I think the t-shirt printer should get a bonehead 
award too, for his extremely immature and stooopid comments. 
I don&#039;t know ANY Americans who associate black color with 
slavery these days.
Menthol cigarettes, different fashion sense, different music, yes, 
but slavery does never come into conversation or consideration.
I guess I am associating with totally different people than that
Manhattan t-shirt printer.
</font>
<hr />

The artist tried to concentrate on his work, but the attraction
he felt for his model finally became irresistible. He threw
down his palette, took her in his arms and kissed her.

She pushed him away. "Maybe your other models let you
kiss them," she said.

"I&#039;ve never tried to kiss a model before," he swore.

"Really?" she said, softening, "How many models have there
been?"

"Four," he replied, "A jug, two apples, and a vase."

<hr />

During the weeks before Jill&#039;s wedding, she was terribly anxious
about making some mistakes at the ceremony. The minister
reassured her several times, pointing out that the service was not
difficult and she will do just fine.

"All you have to remember," he said, "is that when you enter the
church you walk up the AISLE. The groom and best man will be
waiting before the ALTAR. Then I shall request the congregation
to sing a HYMN....then we shall get on with the ceremony.
All you have to remember is the order in which those things happen
and you can&#039;t go wrong."

The happy day finally arrived, and the bridegroom waited nervously
for his bride to appear.

When she arrived and stood alongside him, he heard her quietly
repeating to herself, "Aisle, altar, hymn, aisle, altar, hymn."

Or, as it sounded to him, "I&#039;ll alter him!"

Re: Antispywaremaster

I have apparently been infected with a bug called antispyware master.  
Spybot doesn&#039;t see it, neither does my antivirus. I looked it up and it 
seems to be one of the most common, and one of the worst to get 
rid of because it changes. Do you, O sage, know how I got this, and 
how to get rid of it? I am very careful about my surfing! Thank you for 
everything, especially being someone we can ask and expect straight

Dear Shelly
From what I could find, it comes bundled with some stuff that
you or your hubby agreed to get, without reading the small print.

<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" >http://www.superantispyware.com/</a>  supposedly removes it.

Manual removal instructions are at

A son comes home from the Army. After a few hours, he
finally gets to talk to his father alone behind the
barn.

"So, son, what did the Army teach you?" asked the
father.

"Well, they taught me how to kill people," said the
son.

"With what?" asked father.

"We used all kinds of things, like guns and knives, but
my favorite was the grenade," said the son.

"What&#039;s a grenade?" asked the father.

"Well, I brought one home to show you. You just pull
this pin out and throw it as far as you can," said the
son. The son proceeded to give a demonstration. Lo and
behold, the son throws the grenade behind the
outhouse.

KABOOM!!! The outhouse is demolished. All the lumber
and everything else lands in a heap in the yard.
Grandpa sticks his head out of the pile and says,
"Whew, glad I didn&#039;t let that one loose in the house!"

<hr />

A man was in bad shape.  He constantly gasped for breath and 
his eyes bulged.  The doctors could not determine the cause of 
the problem and didn&#039;t give him long to live.  So, he decided to 
live it up. 

Withdrawing all of his money from the bank, he went on a 
shopping spree.  His last stop was at the most expensive 
haberdashery in the city.  He pointed out a dozen silk shirts. 
He wore a size fourteen.  The clerk said, "Your neck looks 
bigger than fourteen.  You need a sixteen." 

The man said, "I know my size.  I want them in a fourteen." 

The clerk shook his head and said, "I&#039;ll get them for you, but 
I want to warn you, if you wear a fourteen you&#039;ll gasp all day 
and your eyes will bulge."

Eternal nothingness is fine if you happen to be dressed for it.
--- Woody Allen

It is impossible to defeat an ignorant man in argument.
--- William G. McAdoo

<hr />

Ending his sermon, a preacher announced that he would preach 
on Noah and the Ark on the following Sunday, and gave the 
scriptural reference for the congregation to read ahead of time. 

A couple of boys noticed something interesting about the 
placement of the story in the Bible.  They slipped into the 
church and glued two pages of the pulpit Bible together. 

The next Sunday, the preacher got up to read his text. 
"Noah took unto himself a wife," he began, "and she was" 
- he turned the page to continue - "three hundred cubits long, 
fifty wide and thirty high." 

He paused, scratched his head, turned the page back, read it 
silently, and turned the page again.  Then he looked up at his 
congregation and said, "I&#039;ve been reading this old Bible for 
near fifty years, but there are some things in it that are hard 
to believe."

<B>Nudist Germans looking too god for Polish Voyeurs</b>

German nudists have been told to cover up on a beach after 
the removal of border fences with Poland.

The view of nature lovers - which has so upset Polish 
politicians on the Baltic coast that they&#039;re accusing the Germans 
of being "perverts" - only came to light because of new EU rules.

But German holiday-makers say their neighbours are only getting 
an eyeful because they use binoculars.

Polish councillor Edward Zajac from the Swinoujscie region on 
Poland&#039;s north west coastal border says the sight of naked 
Germans on the nearby beach is offensive and that "undressing 
is a perversion".

But now German nudists have torn their neighbours off a strip for 
kinky voyeurism.
"This is a beach for nudists," said German tourist Elke Bernhol. 
"It&#039;s terrible the way Poles come over fully clothed and stare."

"We feel like monkeys in a zoo," said another, Ines Muller. 
"Poles come with binoculars, gape at us and swear."

The nude beach had been hidden for decades but became 
visible when Poland joined the EU&#039;s Schengen agreement on 
a borderless Europe last December and took down border 
fences that had blocked views onto the beach.

Police Quotes 

"The handcuffs are tight because they&#039;re new. 
They&#039;ll stretch out after you wear them awhile." 

"So, you don&#039;t know how fast you were going.  I guess that 
means I can write anything I want on the ticket, right?" 

"Warning!  You want a warning?  Okay, I&#039;m warning you 
not to do that again or I&#039;ll give you another ticket, 
just like this one." 

"The answer to this last question will determine whether 
you are drunk or not.  Was Mickey Mouse a cat or dog?" 

"Yeah, we have a quota.  Two more tickets 
and my wife gets a toaster oven." 

<hr />

"If you had a quarter," quizzed the teacher, "and you asked 
your father for another dollar and fifty cents, how much 
money would you have?" 

"One quarter." answered little Johnny. 

The teacher shook her head and said, "You don&#039;t know 
your arithmetic, do you, Johnny?" 

Little Johnny shook his head, too, "You don&#039;t know my father."

Re: Page Numbering in Open Office
<i>
Hi Dear Webby,
I am once more looking for your invaluable help. 
In today&#039;s HL  you mention Open Office. I just downloaded it 
and can&#039;t figure out how to insert page numbers in the lower 
right hand corner of documents. 
Thank you once again,
Walter
</i>
Dear Walter
ALT I R     (Insert, FooteR)  makes a footer.
If it is not already there, put the cursor into the footer
Type "Page "and a space, without the quotes, of course.
ALT I D P  (Insert, FielD, Page Number)
Type "of "and a space
ALT I D C  (Insert, FielD, pageCount)
CTRL A  (Select All)
CTRL R (Shove all the footer stuff over to the right side)

The result will be: 
                                                                           Page 1 of 7

You can of course format the font and size, add date, time, title, etc.
The main difference is that you hit ALT I R first to deliberately make a footer.
 
Have FUN!

A man who suffered from impotence went to see a doctor, who  gave him
a monkey gland implant, which worked perfectly. Nine months and two
weeks later, his wife had a baby.

When the nurse came out of the delivery room with the news, he asked,
"Is it a boy or a girl?"

"We won&#039;t know until it comes down off the chandelier"

<hr />

A well-built young lady was lying on her
psychiatrist&#039;s couch, telling him how frustrated
she was. "I tried to be an actress and failed,"
she complained. "I tried to be a secretary and
failed; I tried being a writer and failed; then
I tried being a sales clerk and I failed at that,
too."

The shrink thought for a moment and said...
"Everyone needs to live a full, satisfying life.
Why don&#039;t you try nursing?"

The girl thinks about this, then bares one of her 
breasts, points it at the shrink, and says 
"Well go ahead, I&#039;ll give it a try!"

<hr />

You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
--- C. S. Lewis

No one gossips about other people&#039;s secret virtues.
--- Bertrand Russell

<hr />

A old man stops by a cafe for breakfast. After paying the
tab, he checks his pockets and leaves three pennies for a
tip.

As he strides toward the door, his waitress muses, only
half to herself, "You know, you can tell a lot about a man
by the tip he leaves."

The old man turns around, curiosity getting the better of
him. "Oh, really? Tell me, what does my tip say?"

"Well, this penny tells me you&#039;re a thrifty man."

Barely able to conceal his pride, the man utters, "Hmm,
true enough."

"And this penny, it tells me you&#039;re a bachelor."

Surprised at her perception, he says, "Well, that&#039;s true,
too."

"And the third penny tells me that your father was also a
bachelor."

goes to Villagers of Lunt, England

<B>Lunt villagers can&#039;t cope with graffiti</b>

A campaign has been launched in the historic village of Lunt 
to change its name because vandals keep defacing road signs.

<img src="http://webby.com/humor/i/lunt.jpg">

The not-so-witty pranksters constantly change the village&#039;s 
name to an extremely rude swear word, reports the Daily 
Telegraph.

However, the proposal is dividing villagers in the Merseyside 
community who say they should not have to give up a name 
that has been around since the 13th century.

Martyn Ball, a retired police officer and prospective Conservative 
councillor, is urging residents to support the move because he is 
fed up with the graffiti which greets visitors to the village.

He said: "We are all painfully aware of the repeated times our 
village sign is defaced by mindless yobs who change the L to a C.

"Drive in every day and you see a very offensive word."
Dr Ball has suggested Launt as an alternative name, which he 
says would be pronounced the same. However, others in the 
village say the vandals should not be allowed to ruin their
 heritage.

Steward Dobson, 84, a parish councillor, said: "This village is 
very, very old and people don&#039;t want the name changed."

David Roughley, whose family has farmed in Lunt since 1851, 
added: "At the end of the day we live in Lunt and we don&#039;t want 
to change because of a few yobs. It is the vandals who should 
change, not the village."

Cameras, proximity detector activated dye packs, motion detector
activated water sprayers, or even something as simple as a
trip-wire activated water pistol filled with dye and skunk oil has not
occurred to the simple folks there.

Two husbands, Greg and Paul, were discussing their married lives.
Although happily married, they admitted that there were arguments
sometimes.

Then Greg said, "I&#039;ve made one great discovery. I now know how to always
have the last word."

"Wow!" said Paul, "How do you manage that?"

"It&#039;s easy," replied Greg. "My last words are always &#039;Yes, Dear.&#039;"

Farmer: On a typical day I have to get up at six in the morning,
then I work for five hours, then I take out a few minutes for lunch,
then I work another five hours...

City Man: With all that work, what do you grow?

Farmer: Tired.

Re: Is Open Office OK for business?
<i>
Dear Webby
I tried to get my brother&#039;s old Microsoft Office after he left
college, to use in my business. He told me to use Open
Office, and that MS Office was only used in college "because
the shiny shoes get bribed and/or were scared of having to
learn someting new." He said Open Office was not only
free, but actually better than MS Office.
Is that true?
Susan
</i>
Dear Susan
Yes, that is indeed true.
Open Office has more features that are appreciated daily
in the business world, for example saving invoices or quotes
or flyers as PDF files, and it can save files not only in the
Open Standard format, but even in Word perfect or Microsoft
format. 

If both cost the same, I would buy Open Office. Since
Open Office is free, and always will be, the choice is quite
clear. 
Have FUN!

A radical feminist is getting on a bus when, just in front
of her, a man gets up from his seat.

She thinks to herself, "Here&#039;s another man trying to keep
up the customs of a patriarchal society by offering a poor,
defenseless woman his seat," so she pushes him back onto
the seat.

A few minutes later, the man tries to get up again. She is
still insulted so she refuses to let him up again.

Finally, the man says, "Look, lady, you&#039;ve got to let me get
up. I&#039;m twelve blocks past my stop already."

An old man limped into the doctor&#039;s office and said, 
"Doctor, my knee hurts so bad, I can hardly walk!" 

The doctor slowly eyed him from head to toe, 
paused and then said, "Sir, how old are you?" 

"I&#039;m 98," the man announced proudly. 

The doctor just sighed, and looked at him again. 
Finally he said, "Sir, I&#039;m sorry.  I mean, just 
look at you.  You are almost one hundred years old, 
and you&#039;re complaining that your knee hurts? 
Well, what did you expect?" 

The old man said, "Well, my other knee 
is 98 years old too, and it doesn&#039;t hurt!"

People everywhere confuse what they read in newspapers with news.
--- A. J. Liebling

<hr />

For the umpteenth time Mrs. Youngston came to her parish priest to 
tell him, "Father, I&#039;m so scared! Joe says he&#039;s going to kill me if I 
continue to come to your church."

"Yes, yes, my child," replied Father Francis McCrady, more than a 
little tired of hearing this over and over. "I will continue to pray for you, 
Mrs. Youngston. Have faith - the Lord will watch over you." 

"Oh yes, Father, he has kept me safe thus far, only....."

"Only what, my child?"

"Well, Father, now he says if I keep coming to your church, he&#039;s 
going to kill YOU!"

"Well, now," said the priest, "Perhaps it&#039;s time to check out 
Father Lawrence Greider&#039;s parish over on the other side of town."

goes to Bakimci, from Syria

<B>Truck driver&#039;s sat nav gaffe</b>

A Syrian lorry driver taking luxury cars from Turkey to 
Gibraltar was sent on a 1,600 mile detour to Skegness, England 
by his sat nav.

Birdwatchers at Skegness&#039;s Gibraltar Point looked on in 
astonishment as Necdet Bakimci tried to steer his 32-tonne 
lorry down a narrow lane towards the North Sea.

When questioned by onlookers, he explained in broken English 
that he was looking for Coral Road on Gibraltar, reports the 
Daily Telegraph.

It is thought that the confusion arose because his device had 
the Rock listed as UK territory and so directed him towards England.

Steven Humphreys, 57, of Burgh le Marsh, Lincs, said: "He showed 
me his delivery docket. I had my laptop and found the place on 
Gibraltar. Amazingly, the guy didn&#039;t seem too upset."

Eventually, Mr Bakimci arranged for his firm in Antakya, Turkey, to 
ship the cars to the correct destination from Birmingham and 
began his journey home.

------------
Skegness is about a third of the way up England&#039;s East coast.

One day, two guys decide to take a drive to a local grocery 
store to get some lunch. On the way to the store they ran 
into an intersection with a stoplight. The light showed red. 
The man driving went right through the red light. The passenger 
looked at the driver and screamed,

"What the heck are you doing? You&#039;re going to get us killed!" 

The driver responded, "Don&#039;t worry, my mother always drives like this."

So later on, the two guys came to another stoplight and that too was 
red. The driver sped right through the light. Again the passenger 
looked at the driver and said, "I thought I told you, you&#039;re gonna get 
us killed! Would you please stop this nonsense!" 

The driver looked at the passenger and responded, "All right! I get it 
but I told you My mother drives like this all the time!"

Again, the two guys ran into another light. This time in was green. 
The Driver slammed on his brakes and stopped the car totally. 
"What the hell are you doing?" The passenger screamed. 
"This is the third time you almost got us killed. Why did you stop 
at a green light?"

"Well, my mother might be coming the other way!" The driver said.

A beautiful young woman went into the hospital for a
minor operation. On the day of her operation, the
nurses prepared her and wheeled her down to the operating
theatre, and left her lying outside on a trolley for a
few minutes. While she was lying there, a young man in
a white coat came along, lifted her gown up, and began
to examine her naked body. He then went away and
consulted with another colleague in a white coat. They
both returned and examined her again. A third colleague
was called over, and he too began to examine her.

By this time, the young lady was becoming quite frustrated
at the long wait for her operation, and asked the white
coated individuals: "Look, I don&#039;t mind you examining me,
but when is this bloody operation going to start?"

"We haven&#039;t got a clue," came the reply,
"we&#039;re just the painters."

<B>Firewood Tips: Find Dry (Seasoned) Wood</b>
It takes 8 to 12 months to dry (season) wood for burning so
unless you have wood on hand already, you will want to purchase
dry wood. Dry wood burns longer, cleaner and produces greater
heat. Unseasoned wood creates a potentially dangerous creosote
buildup in your chimney.

If you dry the wood in your yard, pile it onto plastic sewer pipe
runners. That not only blocks most of the creepy-crawlies, but it
speeds up the drying quite dramatically. The electrical and 
moisture insulation somehow makes a huge difference.

Thaks to Lilly for this one:
Being a newspaper photographer, my husband would often get home
late with the excuse "I had to shoot a car wreck," or "I had to shoot
a football game."

Once, some unexpected company dropped by and asked how late my
husband would be. "I don&#039;t know," I replied, not intending to shock
them. "He has to shoot the governor."

A sergeant was passing the barracks after lights out, when he
heard some voices from inside.  He slammed open the door,
and shouted:  Listen, you guys!  A few minutes ago, you all
heard me say good night. What you must realize, is that when
I say "Good Night," what I really mean is "Shut the @#$% up!!!"

The room instantly fell silent.  But after a few seconds, a small
voice could be heard from somewhere in the far back of the
dark room:

"Good Night, Sergeant"

<B>Pettiest waste of taxpayers money</b>
BONITA SPRINGS, Fla. (UPI) -- A Florida man is facing criminal 
charges after he was arrested for allegedly stealing 42 cents 
from a water fountain in a shopping center, police said. 

Laslo Mujzer, 43, of Bonita Springs, Fla., was taken into police 
custody and charged with petty theft after a shopper at the 
Coastland Center mall reported him Monday for allegedly 
taking change from an outdoor fountain, police said. 

Mujzer was held until police arrived at took him to the Collier 
County jail, where he was held on a $500 bond, police 
records indicate. 

Naples police Capt. John Adams told the Naples (Fla.) News 
the money in the fountain was intended for the Habitat for 
Humanity of Collier County. 

"He shouldn&#039;t be taking change out of the mall fountain. It&#039;s 
not found money. It&#039;s money that&#039;s destined for charity," Adams said.

Having arrived at the edge of the river, the fisherman soon
realized he had forgotten to bring any bait. Just then he
happened to see a little snake passing by who had caught a
worm. The fisherman snatched up the snake and robbed him of
his worm. Feeling sorry for the little snake with no lunch,
he snatched him up again and poured a little beer down his
throat and went about his fishing.

An hour or so later the fisherman felt a tug at his pant leg.
Looking down, he saw the same snake with three more worms.

Dear Thomas
I have not found any weather site that will work in all areas 
where subscribers live.
Just go to your favorite weather site, set your preferences, 
refresh, then the drag the little icon from the left of the address

When you hit that icon, it will bring up your weather with all
your preferences, just like you had them.

One day during cooking class, our teacher, Mrs. Pritchard,
was extolling her secrets for preparing perfect sauces. When
she ordered us to the stoves to prepare our assignments, she
said, "Don&#039;t forget to use wooden spoons." 

As I stirred my sauce, I contemplated the physics behind the 
mystery of the wooden spoon and decided it must have 
something to do with heat conduction. I approached 
Mrs. Pritchard about my theory.

"Why wooden spoons?" I asked. 

"Because," she replied, "if I have to sit here listening to 
all you morons banging your metal spoons against metal pots, 
I&#039;ll go nuts!"

Auto Cool is a solar powered fan that has been heavily marketed
on TV throughout the summer. They advertise that it keep your car
cool when it is parked in the hot sun.  The problem is, it
doesn&#039;t work. Many reviewers of this product actually state it

For passive shielding get some cheap space blankets from a
camping store or off the web for about $2.50 a piece.
Here is a link to one of countless sources: <a href="http://snipurl.com/36x82" target="_blank" >http://snipurl.com/36x82</a>

Google for a local source to avoid shipping charges.  It is a 
reflective blanket about 5&#039; x 7&#039; and weighs 2 ounces. It reflects
ALL of the sun if you use it as a fly and not quite touching the car.
I have used them since the 60&#039;s and they are indeed amazing.

Don&#039;t poke holes into them and don&#039;t put grommets into them.
Stick some duck tape onto the corners so that it sticks out, and put
gromets into those duck tape ears. Then you can secure it with
thin, lightweight bungee cords.

A young couple met with their pastor to set a date for their wedding. When
he asked whether they preferred a contemporary or a traditional service,
they opted for the contemporary.

On the big day, a major storm forced the groom to take an alternate route to
the church. The streets were flooded, so he rolled up his pants legs to keep
his trousers dry.

When he finally reached the church, his best man rushed him into the
sanctuary and up to the altar, just as the ceremony was starting. "Pull down
your pants," whispered the pastor. "Uh, Reverend, I&#039;ve changed my mind," the
groom responded. "I think I would prefer the traditional service."

goes to Birgit Mahler, 33, of Sonthofen, germany

<B>Shoplifter left daughter behind</b>

A German shoplifter who ran off with expensive cosmetics 
was caught after leaving her six-year-old daugher behind.

Birgit Mahler, 33, stuffed the cosmetics worth $160 in her 
handbag and left the shop in the German city of Sonthofen 
without paying.

But a security tag set off an alarm, and as soon as she heard it,
Mahler ran off down the road before staff could react.

A police spokesman said: "She showed staff a clean pair of heels, 
but she forgot about her six-year-old daughter who was left 
standing alone wondering where her mother had gone."

Store staff called police and they collected the child together 
with a social worker.

The spokesman added: "The girl&#039;s father turned up to report 
the child missing and seemed genuinely surprised to hear 
how his daughter had been lost.

"We took down the details of the mother and have arranged 
to interview her over the incident."

A modest man was in the hospital for a series of test.  One of the
last tests has left his system upset.  Upon making several false
alarms to the bathroom he decided the latest was another.  But he
completely filled his bed up with human waste and was embarrassed
beyond anything he could possible face.

Losing his presence of mind, he jumped up, gathered up the bed
sheets and threw them out the hospital window.

A drunkard was walking by the hospital when the sheets landed on
him.  He started yelling, cussing and swinging his arms which
drew the attention of the security guard.

The security guard asked, "What&#039;s going on here?!?!?"

And the drunk replied, "I think I just beat the crap out of a ghost!"

Dear Renee
Gmail (Google Mail) is mail run by Google, 
instead of by the the silly yahoos (Yuppie Artsy Hebrew Oddball Opportunists).

Like everything at Google, gmail works reliably and predictably.
You can use gmail as WebMail, or you can use it with professional 
POP email programs like Eudora, Pegasus, or semi-professional 
POP programs like Outlook, Outlook Express, etc.

You can continue to use Yahoo for cybersex, groups or whatever 
you use it for. You will just have a new and additional email address, 
and a mail system that works reliably and predictably.
Have FUN!

Joe was delivering a load of manure to the convent and remarked 
to the friar about the beautiful roses they had. The friar told
him that there would be a lot more and bigger roses, but that
they were suffering from "Black Death".

Joe had never heard of that and asked what this "Black Death"
was all about.

"Nuns with scissors," the friar replied.

The beginning of knowledge is the discovery of something 
we do not understand.

Everyone is as God has made him, 
and oftentimes a great deal worse.
--- Miguel de Cervantes

<hr />

Two zebras are talking and one asks the other, "Am I black with white
stripes or white with black stripes?" The other replies, "Well I don&#039;t
know. You should pray to God about that and ask him." So that night he
did and God replied, "You are what you are." The next day he said to the
other zebra, "I still don&#039;t understand what I am because God just said,
You are what you are." The second zebra responds, "You must be white
with black stripes or else God would have said, Yo is what yo is.."

goes to Keith Walendowski , 57, of Milwaukee

Sent in By Eric and also by Ross
<B>Man charged with shooting lawn mower</b>
From the Milwaukee Journal-Standard

FRIDAY, July 25, 2008, 11:49 a.m.
Keith Walendowski is charged with shooting a lawn mower.
A 57-year-old south side man, who might have been struggling 
with a hangover, is charged today with shooting his lawn mower 
with a sawed-off shotgun.

"I&#039;ll tell you the truth," a criminal complaint quotes an apparently 
inebriated Keith Walendowski. "I got pissed because my lawn 
mower wouldn&#039;t start, so I got my shotgun and shot it.

"I can do that. It&#039;s my lawn mower and my yard, so I can shoot 
it if I want," Walendowski told police.

Ignorance of the law, however, is not a legal defense.
Walendowski is charged with a felony count of possessing a 
short-barreled shotgun and a misdemeanor count of disorderly 
conduct while armed. If convicted of both charges, he faces up 
to six years and nine months in prison.

The shooting occurred Wednesday at a home Walendowski 
shares with his mother in the 3500 block of S. Austin St.
According to the complaint, Walendowski had been drinking all 
morning. Around 9:30 a.m., he attempted to start his 21-inch 
Lawn-Boy - unsuccessfully.

After shooting the mower, he went in his basement, where he 
was arrested after "a woman in the house" called police, the 
complaint says.

Police recovered the shotgun, shells, a handgun, rounds for the 
handgun and a stun gun.

Dick Wagner of Wagner&#039;s Garden Mart, 6075 N. Green Bay Ave., 
said shooting the mower didn&#039;t help Walendowski&#039;s odds of getting 
it repaired. "Anything not factory recommended would void the 
warranty," he said.

A dietician was once addressing a large audience in
Chicago.
"The material we put into our stomachs is enough to
have killed most of us sitting here, years ago. Red
meat is awful. Vegetables can be disastrous, and none
of us realizes the germs in our drinking water. But
there is one thing that is the most dangerous of all
and we all eat it. Can anyone here tell me what food it
is that causes the most grief and suffering?"
A 90 year old man in the front row stood up and said,
"Wedding cake."

That&#039;s normal with the new Yahoo mail,

Once you get gmail or any of the properly working email services,

Texan Emergency First Aid
Two men from Texas were sitting at a bar when a young lady
nearby began to choke on a hamburger. As she gasped and gagged,
one Texan turned to the other and said, "That gal is havin&#039; a bad
time. I&#039;m a gonna go over there and help."

The Texan ran over to the young lady, held both sides of her head
in his big, Texan hands, and asked, "Kin ya swaller?"

Gasping, she acknowledged that she couldn&#039;t swallow. Then, the
Texan asked, "Kin ya breathe?" Still gasping, she motioned that
she couldn&#039;t breathe. With that, the Texan yanked up her skirt,
pulled down her panties, and licked her butt. The young woman was
so shocked and humiliated that she screamed at him and brought
up the piece of hamburger and began breathing on her own.

The Texan sat back down with his friend and said, "Ya know, it&#039;s
sure amazin&#039; how that hind-lick maneuver always works!"

Put all the patterns and other supplies for a craft craft project
in a plastic grocery bag with handles. Then slip each handle of
the grocery bag over a clothes hanger and hang it a closet. You
can cross the handles so the bag won&#039;t slip off the hanger. If
the handles still have a tendency to slip, secure them with
clothespins.

The weather was very hot, so this man wanted desperately 
take a dive in the nearby lake. He didn&#039;t bring his swimming outfit, 
but who cared? He was all alone.

So, he undressed and got into the water. After some delightful minutes
of cool swimming, a pair of old ladies walked onto the shore in his direction.

He panicked, got out of the water and grabbed a bucket, which lay on
the sandy beach. He held the bucket in front of his private parts and 
sighed with relief.

The ladies got nearby and looked at him. He felt awkward and wanted to
move.
Then one of the ladies said, "You know, I have a special gift, I can
read minds."

"Impossible," said the embarrassed man, "You really know what I&#039;m
thinking?"

"Yes," the lady replied, "I know that you think that the bucket you&#039;re
holding has a bottom in it."

Two Indian doctors were having an animated discussion.
"I say it&#039;s spelt W-H-O-O-M," said one.
"No, it is W-H-O-M-B," said the other.
A nurse passing by said
"Excuse me, you are both wrong. It is spelled W-O-M-B."

"Thanks nurse," said one, "but we prefer to settle this argument
ourselves, besides, we don&#039;t think you are in a position to
describe the sound of an elephant farting underwater."

goes to Rowing NewZealand

<B>News boat sinks at N.Z. Olympic photo op</b>
HAMILTON, New Zealand (UPI) -- New Zealand rowing officials 
said a news boat recording footage of the country&#039;s Olympic 
team sank, dropping its load of expensive equipment into the 
water.

Rowing NZ spokesman Richard Gee said the photo op at 
Lake Karapiro went horribly wrong when the press boat, which 
was carrying seven journalists representing both newspapers 
and TV, began taking on water and sank, Stuff.co.nz reported Tuesday.

Gee said the seven journalists and the boat&#039;s pilot were 
fished out of the water without injuries by the rowers, 
but hundreds of thousands of dollars in media equipment 
was lost to the lake.

He said investigators do not yet know why the boat sank, 
as nothing previously appeared out of the ordinary and 
conditions were not adverse.

Re: Collection of tips

Dear Webby
I know others have asked you about an ebook collection of
your tips. Are you ever going to get around to that?
Dorothy
</i>
Dear Dorothy
On my last ebook, Ettiquette To Get Read, I made about 
5 cents per hour. Those who bought it, liked it, but very
few bought it. It seems most people on the list consider me
as family, and if something is not free, they don&#039;t want it.
So, writing a new ebook is not very high on my priority list.

There is one available that has many of my tips in it, plus
some extra ones. You can get it at <a href="http://webby.com/formula">Formula</a>
It is well written and in a very easy step by step illustrated
format. You are never left guessing whether you are doing 
the right thing. 

I bought it for myself too, just to see if I am missing
anything, and if you want to tune up and clean up your 
computer, or fix problems, I can highly recommend it.

If you click that link, you&#039;ll see a ridiculously long sales page
that would be more suitable for a $5,000 course. There is 
no useful information in that mile of sales talk. Just hit
CTRL END to get to the bottom. It costs $14.97 and is well
worth it. Print it out and after you have followed all the
instructions, put it into the ziplock bag with warranty and
set-up CDs and official papers for your machine.

Yes, I know you were going to find a ziplok bag for all that
stuff some day. Make today that day!

Have FUN!

Jim and Ted play golf together every Monday. Jim always wins 
because Ted is a terrible putter. One Monday, Ted can&#039;t miss. 
He sinks every shot on the green. Jim can&#039;t believe his eyes! 

After the round, Jim asks, "What has happened? You can&#039;t 
miss today." 

Ted says, "Order up the beer, I have to go to the bathroom." 
When Ted comes back the front of his pants are all wet.
Confused, Jim asks "What happened to your pants?" 
"I&#039;ll get to that in a minute, let tell you about my game. 
I went to the eye doctor last week, and he said that I 
need bifocals. So when I look down, I see a little ball 
and a big ball. I look over and see a little hole and a big 
hole. I put the little ball in the big hole, and I can&#039;t miss." 
"What about your pants?" 
"I looked down and saw a little one and a big one, figured 
the little one wasn&#039;t mine, so I put it away."

Before performing a baptism, the priest approached the young
father and said solemnly, "Baptism is a serious step.  Are you
prepared for it?"

"I think so," the man replied.  "My wife has made appetizers
and we have a caterer coming to provide plenty of cookies and
cakes for all of our guests."

"I don&#039;t mean that," the priest responded.  "I mean, are you
prepared spiritually?"

"Oh, sure," came the reply.  "I&#039;ve got a keg of beer and a case
of whiskey."

<B>MN officers chase burglary suspect to WI and back</b>
 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) Authorities are looking for a man who led 
 officers on a chase from Burnsville, to Wisconsin, to Minneapolis.

Burnsville police detectives tried to arrest the 27-year-old man 
on suspicion of burglary. But the man fled and led Burnsville 
police north on Interstate 35E. The Minnesota State Patrol 
joined the chase, following the man to Wisconsin before he 
drove back to Minnesota and abandoned a stolen Dodge 
Durango near the University of Minnesota.

Authorities tried to end the chase peacefully, and called the 
man on his cell phone. Burnsville investigators say the man 
answered the phone saying, 
&#039;&#039;Dude, I can&#039;t talk, I&#039;m being chased by the police.&#039;&#039;

An obnoxious drunk in a bar keeps hitting on an a lesbian
waiting for her date. The drunk just won&#039;t take no for an
answer.

"Tell you what, I&#039;ll sleep with you if you can name one thing a
man can do for me that my vibrator can&#039;t!"  the lesbian smirks.

The obnoxious drunk thinks for a moment. "Okay, let&#039;s see
your vibrator buy the next round of drinks!"

Judi was startled to see the nonchalant way John was taking
the fact that his lady love was seen with another man.

"You said you love her and yet you saw her with another man
and you didn&#039;t knock the guy down?"

"I&#039;m waiting," Jon said.

"Waiting for what?" asked Judi.

"Waiting to catch her with a smaller guy."

<B>Crockpot for Summer Cooking</b>
The summer is a great time to dust off your slow cooker and put
it use. Crockpots work well for a variety of recipes: soup, stew,
spaghetti, roasts, and more.  Just search on your favorite
website for crockpot recipes.  If heat is a problem, just use it
outside or in the garage.

<a href="http://www.thriftyfun.com/Recipes_Crockpot_833_848.html" target="_blank" >http://www.thriftyfun.com/Recipes_Crockpot_833_848.html</a>

<font color="blue">On a hot, sunny day you can put a 
crock pot into a barbecue. Not lit, just warmed by the sun!
If it is sheltered from the wind, it will get more than hot enough 
just from the sun. You may have to use small wedge to keep 
the lid from closing all the way. 

For windy locations you can throw some bubble-wrap
over it. It won&#039;t melt, but it will increase the temperature
inside the barbecue quite drastically.

A barbecue on solar power also works well for slow brewing
tea for ice tea. For best results use a wide 3 or 4 quart pyrex
pot with a lid.

Have FUN!

A preacher retired and moved to  the country to  enjoy life and
practice his hobby of yard work.  Needing a lawn mower, he
headed into town to buy one. On the way he saw a sign
advertising a lawn mower for sale. He stopped at the house and
a young lad came out to greet him. The preacher asked about
the lawn mower and the kid said it was behind the house. The
two went to look at the lawn mower. The engine was sputtering
along at idle speed. The preacher increased the speed of the
engine and mowed a few strips. Satisfied that the mower would
do the job they settled on a price of $25.00.

Later in the day, the young lad was riding his bicycle when he
spied the preacher pulling on the engine starter rope. The kid
stopped and watched for a couple of minutes. He asked,
"What&#039;s wrong?"

The reply came, "I can&#039;t get this mower started. Do you know
how?"

The kid said, "Yep."

"Well,  how do you do it? Tell me!", the preacher yelled.

The kid replied, "You have to cuss it."

The preacher rose up indignantly. "Now you listen here. I am a
preacher and if I ever did cuss, not saying I have, I&#039;ve forgotten
how to do it after all these years."

With a wise look on his face well beyond his years, the kid
said, "Preacher, you keep on pulling  that rope and it&#039;ll all come
back to ya."

Crime does not pay ... as well as politics.

My definition of an expert in any field is a person who knows enough 
about what&#039;s really going on to be scared.
--- P. J. Plauger

<hr />

Thanks to Dave for this story:
The Ferrari F1 Racing Team recently fired the whole pit crew 
to employ some young unemployed youths from Liverpool. 
The decision to hire them was brought on by a documentary 
on how unemployed youths in the Liverpool area can remove 
a set of car wheels in less than 4 seconds without proper 
equipment. This was thought to be a good move as most 
races are won and lost in the pits these days, and Ferrari 
would thus have an advantage.

However, Ferrari soon encountered a major problem: 
Not only were the lads changing the tires in under 4 seconds 
but within another 10 seconds had repainted, renumbered 
and sold the vehicle to the McLaren team.

goes to Laura-Leah Shaw of Ontario

<B>Woman pays $1,000 to rescue lobster</b>
 
SHEDIAC, New Brunswick (UPI) -- A Canadian woman says she 
plans to release a giant lobster after she paid $1,000 to rescue 
the crustacean from a fish market.

Laura-Leah Shaw purchased the 22-pound lobster, named Big Dee-Dee, 
from the Big Fish seafood market in Shediac, New Brunswick, the 
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.

The report said two unnamed Ontario groups contributed $1,000 each 
to rescue the animal, which is thought to be 100 years old.

Big Fish was auctioning Big Dee Dee for an opening price of 
$1,000, the report said.

Denis Breau, owner of the fish market, said at least 1,000 people 
visited Big Fish to catch a glimpse of Big Dee Dee, who was caught 
in the beginning of July.

Shaw said she would travel to the Maritimes region of eastern 
Canada Monday to let Big Dee Dee go into the wild, but officials 
said the lobster would need to undergo a health inspection before 
it is released, to check for diseases.

Re: Restore desktop

Dear Webby
Is there a better way to save and restore the Windows desktop
than SMD? SMD has worked fine for many years, but after recent
Windows bugfixes and updates, it seems to have lost it&#039;s magic.
I have a lot of icons on my desktop, and get extremely annoyed
when a tool is not where I had put it.
Thanks

Dear Chris
Try Restore Desktop from MidiOx. It&#039;s in my <a href="http://webby.com/tools">toolbox.</a>
After installing it, right-click on the desktop and you will see 
the options to save and to restore the desktop added to the

My friend&#039;s daughter was taking her son, Donny, to
preschool along her usual route. She had always been
aware of the speed trap on the hill but this day, she
was unusually hurried and forgot.
Sure enough, the police pulled her over. Denise was
asked for her license and registration. She started to
giggle. The officer asked her if she thought this was
funny. She said, "No," and that it was her 3 year old
in the back seat.
The officer put his head down to the window and heard
this tiny voice singing,
"What you gonna do when they come for you . . .
what you gonna do . . . bad boy, bad boy . . .
what you gonna do?"
The officer couldn&#039;t stop laughing and let her go with
a warning.

My nephew, who has just started the first grade, was
asked to memorize the Ten Commandments. Upon reciting
the commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," he
was asked what this commandment meant.
With absolute seriousness he replied,
"That means that you shouldn&#039;t do what the adults do."

Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.
� Jim Rohn

<hr />

Thanks to Ann for this report:

&#039;Hello?&#039; 
&#039;Hi honey. This is Daddy. Is Mommy near the phone?&#039; 

&#039;No, Daddy. She&#039;s upstairs in the bedroom with Uncle Paul.&#039; 

After a brief pause..., Daddy says, &#039;But honey, you haven&#039;t got an Uncle Paul.&#039; 

&#039;Oh yes I do, and he&#039;s upstairs in the room with Mommy, Right Now.&#039; 

Brief Pause.... 

&#039;Uh, okay then, this is what I want you to do. Put the phone down on 
the table, run upstairs and knock on the bedroom door and shout to Mommy 
that Daddy&#039;s car just pulled into the driveway..&#039; 

&#039;Okay, Daddy, Just a minute.&#039; 

A few minutes later the little girl comes back to the phone. &#039;I did it, Daddy.&#039; 

&#039;And what happened, honey?&#039; he asked. 

&#039;Well, Mommy got all scared, jumped out of bed with no clothes 
on and ran around screaming. 
Then she tripped over the rug, hit her head on the dresser 
and now she isn&#039;t moving at all!&#039; 

&#039;Oh my God!!! What about your Uncle Paul?&#039; 

&#039;He jumped out of the bed with no clothes on, too. He was all 
scared and he jumped out of the back window and into the 
swimming pool. But I guess he didn&#039;t know that you took out 
the water on the weekend to clean it. He hit the bottom of the 
pool and I think he&#039;s dead.&#039; 

Long Pause... 

Longer Pause ....... 

Even Longer Pause........... 

Then Daddy says, &#039;Swimming pool? .......Is this 486-5731?&#039; 

&#039;No, I think you have the wrong number."

goes to Danny Sanchez, 29, of Eureka Street, Bakersfield, CA

<B>Truck thief takes cable guy for harrowing ride</b>
The Bakersfield Californian | Last Updated: Monday, Jul 21 2008 7:04 AM

A northeast Bakersfield man faces charges after he stole a 
Brighthouse Networks truck Saturday, while a cable company 
employee in a bucket lift attached to the truck and elevated 25 
feet in the air, repaired lines.

Police said Danny Sanchez, 29, of Eureka Street, entered the 
vehicle and drove off around 6:30 p.m. The bucket lift tore 
down several phone lines before Sanchez crashed the vehicle 
into a utility pole, according to Bakersfield police Lt. Mike Cantrell.

Bright House employee Curtis Bartell, 50, remained in the 
bucket during the ordeal. He complained of pain but apparently 
suffered no major injuries, Cantrell said.

Sanchez fled the scene but was located by police Sunday 
morning. He was arrested and charged on suspicion of hit-and-run, 
automobile theft and false imprisonment.
<a href="http://www.bakersfield.com/hourly_news/story/501834.html" target="_blank" >http://www.bakersfield.com/hourly_news/ ... 01834.html</a>
-----------------------
The sign on the lifts normally demand that the outriggers 
be pumped down before entering the bucket. I bet Bartell
considers himself a Bonehead for forgetting to do that.

Thanks to Vickster for this story:
The husband reluctantly agreed to play in the couples alternate 
shot tournament at his club. He teed off on the first hole, 
a par four, and blistered a drive 300 yards down the middle 
of the fairway.

Upon reaching the ball, the husband said to his wife, 
"Just hit it toward the green. Anywhere around there will be fine."

The wife proceeded to shank the ball deep into the woods. 
Undaunted, the husband said, "That&#039;s okay, sweetheart," and 
spent a full five minutes looking for the ball. He found it just 
in time, but in a horrible position. He played the shot of his life 
to get the ball within two feet of the hole.

He told his wife to knock the ball in. His wife then proceeded 
to knock the ball off the green and into a bunker. Still 
maintaining composure, the husband summoned all of his 
skill and holed the shot from the bunker. He took the ball out 
of the hole and, while walking off the green, put his arm around 
his wife and calmly said, "Honey, that was a bogey and that&#039;s 
okay. I think we can do better on the next hole."

To which she replied, "Listen, dear, don&#039;t yell at me. Only two of 
those five shots were mine!"

Dear Webby
If Irene is anywhere near Medicine Hat, I sell HP computers 
with the "option" of having XP instead of Vista.  In rare cases 
the option doesn&#039;t get exercised but I&#039;m selling piles of 
these computers to individuals with XP.  

If I can help anyone in Alberta, Saskatchewan or anywhere 
else they&#039;re willing to cover a bit of shipping in return for a lot 
less grief, they can email me at <a href="mailto:donovan@memlane.com" target="_blank" >donovan@memlane.com</a> or 
call me at (403) 526-2288.

</i>Dear Donovan
Except for your town folks, people have to pay shipping anyway.
No computer vendor donates the shipping, and I have a hunch
that you mark it up less than they do.

Donovan has been a subscriber for many years and has often
contributed very useful and helpful advice. If you want a new
computer with properly installed XP, without the BS and hassle
the big vendors make you go through, call or email Donovan!

Thanks to Sandie for this story:
When we put our house up for sale, I stressed emphatically that 
my sons make their beds each morning.

I left for work before they left for school and I wanted to be 
sure the house looked presentable when the agent showed it to 
prospective buyers.

I was surprised and impressed that my 15-year-old son&#039;s bed 
was perfectly made each day. Until, that is, one night when 
I went into his room, I discovered his secret.

He was fast asleep on the floor in his sleeping bag.

<B>The Dangers of Co-Signing</b>
With a co-signer a person with no credit or bad credit can
qualify for a loan that they wouldn&#039;t ordinarily be able to get.
However, co-signing for a loan is not something that should be
done lightly. If the loan goes into default, you will be held
responsible for the debt and it can impact your credit rating.
Only co-sign on a loan that you are prepared to pay off yourself
if necessary.

 According to one &#039;Dr. Beverly Clark&#039; in JUMA (Journal of
 the United Medical Association), there have been
 numerous attacks on unwary airline travelers in the
 restrooms of the planes. The attacker? It is none other
 than the dangerous and deadly Arachnius Gluteus. The
 attacks seem to have started in Chicago&#039;s Blare Airport
 after eating at &#039;Big Chappies&#039;.
 Oh my! Sound scary? It is, not because it&#039;s true but
 because someone actually took the time to come up with this.
 There is no JUMA, no Dr. Beverly Clark writing medical material
 on spiders; the  scientific name of the spider is bogus (butt
 spider?),there is no Blare airport, and no such restaurant called
 Big Chappies. Pure BS, just like gullible warming.

 
 By the way, to clarify my position re gullible warming:
 As I have stated since the ice age scare in the 70&#039;s, yes,
 according to the cycles plainly visible in bar code format
 in thousands of deep canyons, there WILL be an ice age.
 But first it will get a bit warmer. We are about 3/4 of the
 way up towards the warmest period, before it will gradually
 cool off towards the next ice age.
 
 According to my calculations, we will reach the warmest
 period on Thursday afternoon, around 3 PM, in about fourteen
 Thousand years. Cow farts, cars or Volcanoes won&#039;t change
 that one bit.

 An elderly gentleman had serious hearing problems for a
 number of years. He went to the doctor and the doctor was
 able to have him fitted for a set of hearing aids that
 allowed the gentleman to hear 100%.

 The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and
 the doctor said, "Your hearing is perfect. Your family must
 be really pleased that you can hear again."

 The gentleman replied, "Oh, I haven&#039;t told my family yet. I
 just sit around and listen to the conversations. I&#039;ve changed
 my will three times!"

goes to Elizabeth Mateo of Camden, NJ

<B>No sense of humor, just greed</b>
CAMDEN, N.J. (UPI) -- A Camden County, N.J., woman is suing 
her orthopedic surgeon after he rubbed a temporary tattoo onto 
her body while she was unconscious. 

Elizabeth Mateo claims in her suit that she did not realize 
until the morning after the surgery that the surgeon, 
Steven Kirshner, had left a temporary tattoo of a rose on 
her abdomen while she was under anesthesia, the 
Philadelphia Enquirer reported Wednesday. 

"She was extremely emotionally upset by it," said attorney 
Gregg Shivers, who filed the suit on Mateo&#039;s behalf in 
Camden County Superior Court. 

The suit seeks punitive and compensatory damages 
from Kirshner. 

The doctor admitted to placing the tattoo on Mateo but he 
denied any ill intent, the newspaper reported. He said he 
often rubs temporary tattoos on patients as a means of 
helping to raise their spirits after a stressful operation. 

"What&#039;s offensive about this complaint is that it suggests 
something he did was intended to be prurient, and nothing 
could be further from the truth," said Kirshner&#039;s lawyer, 
Robert Agre. "It was intended just to make the patient feel better."

Re: Pre-installed XP
<i>
Dear Webby
I have a few questions about this.
1) Why are businesses allowed to get XP pre-installed, 
but private people are not?

2) Why do I have to buy Vista Business to get XP rights,
even if the computer can&#039;t handle Vista Business?

3) Does Microsoft check if I have a legitimate business,
if I claim I do, when I buy a computer?

Irene

</i>Dear Irene
1) If a business doesn&#039;t want to increase their work force
by 18% to cope with Vista, they will switch to Linux, if
M$ does not let them have XP. Any business with 25 or more
computers usually has at least one employee, who is 
comfortable with Linux, and who can make a company specific 
master CD for quick and easy set-up. Naturally, once they
have upgraded to Linux, no company will ever go back
to Windows, and Microsoft has lost them for good. 
So Microsoft reluctantly lets them buy Vista Ultimate or 
Vista Business, even though the machines they buy, 
can&#039;t handle that, but they throw in the XP license.

YOU, and people like you, don&#039;t usually have an in-house
Linux fan to help them get started, so Microsoft figures
they got you by the short and curly hairs, and they don&#039;t
allow you to get XP. Hitler, ahem, Balmer has spoken,
and you better like the Emperor&#039;s new clothes!

2) The reason for having to pay for Vista Ultimate or Vista
Business, even if the computer you are buying, can&#039;t 
handle that, is to punish you for not liking the Emperor&#039;s
new clothes. There is no technical reason for it, just pure
hateful vindictiveness by the Emperor.

3) The computer makers are supposed to sell Vista Business
only to businesses who buy 25 or more machines per year,
the businesses, who would tell Microsoft to stuff Windows where
the sun don&#039;t shine, if they don&#039;t get an XP installation included.

Microsoft brags about so many Vista&#039;s sold, even though the
Vista CDs are just used to replace the AOL CD beer coasters
in the IT department. Those ARE getting to be quite
scratched up, ya know!

When Dell, or Toshiba or Sony, or whoever you buy a computer 
from, asks you if you are a business and will buy 25 computers 
in a year, everybody just tells them: "Oh, yes, I need those 
Vista CD&#039;s for beer coasters! I want a full set! 
But not tonight, I have a headache from all this BS." 

You don&#039;t have to buy the other 25 right away, and if the 
economy slides left and your doily knitting business doesn&#039;t 
expand as planned, they are not going to hunt you down and 
demand the XP CD back.

In summary, if you want to buy a computer with XP pre-installed
at the factory, don&#039;t go to the HOME computers department,
go to the BUSINESS department at 
Dell, HP, Toshiba (don&#039;t go to their front entrance, use this
secret back door: <a href="http://snipurl.com/32ws7" target="_blank" >http://snipurl.com/32ws7</a> ), Fujitsu or Lenovo.
The business departments of those companies will sell you 
computers with XP pre-installed at the factory, 
and dumpster-ware on a beer coaster.

(Don&#039;t waste time with Gateway, Acer and Asus. They act like
they were Microsoft owned and operated.)

Be aware that the punishment for not liking the Emperor&#039;s
new clothes is paying for Vista Business, even if you have
absolutely no desire or plan to ever use it. It is strictly a fine, 
or sleazy extortion, if you want to call it that. 

By the way, the XP CDs from old klunkers often work quite
fine in new machines. And also keep in mind that klunkers
at yard sales might just be constipated with registry optimizers
and speeder-upper utilities, and will work just fine after a
format and re-install.

Have FUN!

At the start of a meeting of world religious leaders, a
secretary rushed in shouting. "The building is on fire"

The Methodists gathered in a corner and prayed
The Baptists cried "Where is the water?"
The Quakers quietly praised God for the blessings that fire brings
The Lutherans posted a fire notice on the door
The Catholics passed the plate to cover the damage
The Jews sprinted to the parking lot to beat the rush.
The Congregationalists shouted "Every man for himself!"
The Fundamentalists proclaimed "It&#039;s the vengeance of God"
The Episcopalians formed a procession and marched out
The Christian Scientists concluded that there was no fire.
The Unitarians proclaimed the fire had no power over them.
The Presbyterians appointed a chairperson to appoint a committee
    to look into the matter and submit a written report.

The secretary grabbed the fire extinguisher and put the fire out.

The Mormons arrived late for the meeting and missed the
fire completely.

The middle-aged man was shuffling along, bent over
at the waist, as his wife helped him into the doctor&#039;s
waiting room. A woman in the office viewed the scene
in sympathy.  "Arthritis with complications?" she asked.

The wife shook her head, "Noooo....Do-it-yourself,"
she explained, "with concrete blocks."

<B>ACLU claims atrocious fashion sense is "owned" by colored males</b>

 The Associated Press | Sunday, Jul 20 2008 11:10 AM
Last Updated: Sunday, Jul 20 2008 11:15 AM

Be careful if you have saggy pants in the south Chicago 
suburb of Lynwood. Village leaders have passed an ordinance 
that will levy $25 fines against anyone showing three inches or 
more of their underwear in public.

Eugene Williams is the mayor of Lynwood. He says young men 
walk around town half-dressed, keeping major retailers and 
economic development away. He calls the new law a hot topic.

The American Civil Liberties Union says the ordinance targets 
young men of color, since, according to the ACLU, nobody else 
tries to look stupid on purpose.

"Why, I removed them six years ago! Did you ever hear of a
woman having two sets of tonsils?"

"No," the husband retorted, "but you&#039;ve heard of a widower

Re: Alternative method for working on a dead machine
<i>
Dear Webby
Can I offer another response to the "don&#039;t want to open the case" 
question?  If you use the Ubunutu live CD, and plug in a flash drive 
or other USB drive, you can still rescue the data without having to 
touch a screw.  The USB device and the HDD will show up on the 
desktop, then just drag-and-drop.

I do this all the time when I  know a customer&#039;s machine is beyond 
saving and will require a re-install of Windows (or an upgrade to Linux).  
Another benefit, if you&#039;re willing to dip your toes in techie water, is 
that you can scan for viruses from there.
Donovan
</i>
Dear Donovan
Great idea!

For those who don&#039;t know what a "Live CD" is:
Linux is distributed totally different from Windows. You don&#039;t
buy a set-up CD, you download an ISO file and burn it onto a
CD. That is then your set-up CD. However, unlike a Windows
set-up CD, a Linux Live CD doe not automatically trash whatever
is on the computer. It lets you boot up from the CD, with the
Operating System on the CD, and lets you test-drive that
particular flavor of Linux. 

While running in Linux, you can sort out the hard drive, that is
so messed up that Windows won&#039;t boot on it any more.

If you happen to like that flavor of Linux, you can make it
permanent. If you don&#039;t, you pull that CD and reboot back

Keep in mind that, even though the world is slowly migrating
to Linux, it is different from Windows. For the majority I
would not recommend it yet, unless you have a Linux using 
friend nearby, who can help you to get comfortable.

The newly-married husband came home from the office to
find his young wife in floods of tears. "Darling, whatever
is the matter?" he asks.

"Sweetheart," she sobs, "the most terrible thing has
happened! I cooked my very first Beef Bourguignon for you,
and I got it out the oven to season it, and the phone rang.
When I came back from answering the phone," she sobbed
again "I found that the cat had eaten it!"

"Don&#039;t worry, darling," said her husband. "Don&#039;t cry.
we&#039;ll get a new cat tomorrow."

<B>Plant Cuttings for Gifts</b>
I often give plants that I have started from cuttings as gifts.
To brighten these up, I use a water pic from the florist with one
or 2 blossoms from my yard to add a bit of color. I stick the pic
into the soil, and make a bow that matches in color or
compliments the flowers or the pot and voila!

Ability is what you&#039;re capable of doing. 
Motivation determines what you do. 
Attitude determines how well you do it.

An instructor at a girls� school in the southwest is giving her students 
what she calls a �charm course.�

�You give your escort the chance to be gallant,� she says. �For instance, 
you should remain seated in the pickup truck until he has had time to 
step around and open the door for you.�

Then, returning to reality she adds �Of course, if the big oaf is in the 
restaurant flirting at the waitress, don�t wait any longer.�

<B>Robber turned out to be Dad</b>

A US pizza worker was shocked when a workmate overpowered a 
disguised robber - and it turned out to be her father.

Stephanie Martinez was getting money out of a cash drawer 
when Rudy Sandoval fought back against the intruder, 
knocking off his wig and sunglasses.

Ms Martinez was so surprised when she saw the robber&#039;s face 
that she dropped the money, reports the Dallas Morning News.

"I said, &#039;Don&#039;t hit him again! That&#039;s my dad!&#039; And he said, 
&#039;What&#039;s he doing here?&#039; and I said, &#039;I don&#039;t know!&#039;"

Police say the suspect, Benjamin Ramirez, 41, ran out of the 
pizzaria in Denton, near Dallas, Texas, to a pick-up truck, 
where Ms Martinez&#039;s mother and husband were waiting.

But officers don&#039;t think Ms Martinez knew her family was 
planning the robbery.

"We will not be filing charges against her," Sgt. James 
Brett said. "Her husband told us she didn&#039;t know. He knew 
they were going to rob someplace, but he thought it was 
going to be a convenience store."

Witnesses followed the pickup and helped lead police to it, 
where Ramirez, Sonia Palacios, 38, and Jose Miguel 
Martinez, 26, were arrested.

All three have been charged with aggravated robbery.

Hair cut
Women&#039;s version:

Woman1: Oh! You got a haircut! That&#039;s so cute!
Woman2: Do you think so? I wasn&#039;t sure when she gave me
        the mirror. I mean, you don&#039;t think it&#039;s too
        fluffy looking?
Woman1: Oh God no! No, it&#039;s perfect. I&#039;d love to get my
        hair cut like that, but I think my face is too
        wide. I&#039;m pretty much tuck with this stuff I
        think.
Woman2: Are you serious? I think your face is adorable,
        and you could easily get one of those layer
        cuts - that would look so cute I think. I was
        actually going to do that except that I was
        afraid it would accent my long neck.
Woman1: Oh - that&#039;s funny! I would love to have your
        neck! Anything to take attention away from this
        two-by-four I have for a shoulder line.
Woman2: Are you kidding? I know girls that would love
        to have your shoulders. Everything drapes so
        well on you. I mean, look at my arms - see how
        short they are? If I had your shoulders I could
        get clothes to fit me so much easier.........


Men&#039;s version:

Man1: Got your ears lowered?
Man2: Yeah. That time of the year.

Re: Need for remote drive

Dear Webby
Got to pick your brain one more time........ here is the 
scenero ....... I have heard that you can fix another 
computer that has a minor problem and or reformat with 
out taking apart the computer (hard drive and making it a 
slave) ....... Can you hook up 2 computers using either 
USB or Ethernet Cord to scan and repair the bad computer?
 
And does the computer that is bad --- when hooking it up, 
does it have to have the monitor, keyboard and all connected?
 
Have a great day almighty and powerfull .......  Mr. Webby

Dear Eddie
If a computer is so messed up that you can&#039;t clean it up,
and you need to format it, you can do that without opening
it up. Just stick the set-up CD into the drive and reboot.

You CAN scan a computer over a network, but you need
to have a network license for the scanning program. The
free sample versions usually on&#039;t include that, however,
you can scan a USB drive, since it acts like a local drive.

The only time you have to take the drive out and put it
into a USB drive, is when Windows won&#039;t stay lit up or
won&#039;t boot up, but you want to salvage data before formatting
and reloading Windows.

Taking the drive out is about as technically challenging as
taking a beer out of the fridge, but might be a bit more
physically challenging, if your computer is deep under your
desk. Once the drive is in a USB drive enclosure, it acts
like the second drive of the machine, that the enclosure
is plugged into. No need for a second monitor or keyboard.

Unless you need to salvage irreplaceable data, and can&#039;t
upload it to the net or burn it onto a CD, just format and
reload. You will never be able to clean up a totally messed
up computer by using free utilities, just like the ones that
caused the mess in the first place. 

Have FUN!

Grampa was telling his youngest grandson abuot his terrifying 
experience with cannibals.
"There I was, lost in the middle of the jungle, surrounded by 
twenty hungry cannibals."

His grandson, Oleander, said, "But last time you told me, 
there were only ten hungry cannibals."

To which grampa answered, "Ah, but you were too young then 
to know the whole horrible truth!"

<B>Keep Groceries Cool on the Way Home</b>
Keep a cooler in your trunk to put perishable groceries in when
you are driving home from the grocery store. Group them on the
checkout conveyor belt so it&#039;s easy for the checker to put like
items in bags. For frozen foods, many grocery stores have dry ice
available.

The back seat is cooler than the trunk, and usually much
windier. Put a wet beach towel over the groceries and tuck it
in securely and open he back windows for maximum draft back
there. Evaporative cooling will dry the towel and keep your

A noted psychiatrist was a guest at a National Organization for 
Women gathering, and his hostess naturally broached the 
subject in which the doctor was most at ease. 
"Would you mind telling me, Doctor," she asked, "how you 
detect a mental deficiency in somebody who appears 
completely normal?"

"Nothing is easier," he replied. "You ask him a simple question 
which everyone should answer with no trouble. If he hesitates, 
that puts you on the track."

"What sort of question?"

"Well, you might ask him, &#039;Captain Cook made three trips 
around the world and died during one of them. Which one?&#039;

The woman thought a moment, then said with a nervous laugh, 
"You wouldn&#039;t happen to have another example, would you? 
I must confess I don&#039;t know much about history."

The petty economies of the rich are just as amazing as 
the silly extravagances of the poor.

<hr />

Boudreaux and Pierre decided to go to the casino.
Boudreaux told Pierre as they entered, "All right
Pierre, we&#039;ll meet here in an hour, OK?"

"OK, man," said Pierre.

Well, when they were done, Boudreaux was
broke, but Pierre had a bucket full of quarters.

"Man, were you got all &#039;em quarters?" asked
Boudreaux.

Pierre, leaning close, whispered, "Man, I don&#039;t
wann say this too loud, but you see that game
over there, every time I put in a dollar, it give
me four quarters!"&#039;

goes to the Seattle, WA school board

<B>Twins assigned separate schools</b>

SEATTLE (UPI) -- A set of Seattle twins will be in separate 
schools when they start kindergarten this fall unless district 
officials change their assignments, their mother says. 

Stephanie Jewett says Annika is assigned to Bryant Elementary 
and her sister Nicole is to attend Wedgwood, The Seattle 
Times reported Tuesday. The twins were placed in separate 
schools, even though she listed the same three preferred 
schools in the same order on each girl&#039;s application and 
noted they are twins, the newspaper said. 

But the school district&#039;s placement policy overrode the 
family&#039;s choices. 

"It looks like there&#039;s a glitch in the program," parent activist 
Lisa Bond said. 

School Board member Harium Martin-Morris, telling the 
Times "When you think about it, it&#039;s not right." 

But thinking could hert, ya know!

At this point, the Jewett sisters will be heading off to different schools this fall.

struck up a conversation. Just as he was telling me that his
wife was getting carried away with her shopping, a brief power

<B>Find Out What Your Wear</b>
A good way to find out what you wear is to take all the hangers
and turn them around so they are facing the wrong way.  As you
wear, wash and return clothing back to the closet, hang the
clothing the correct way.  After a month or two, any clothing
still facing the wrong direction should probably be stored or
donated.

Joan, the town gossip and supervisor of the town&#039;s morals,
recently accused George, a local man, of being an alcoholic
because she saw his pickup truck parked outside the town&#039;s 
only bar.

George stared at her for a moment, and said nothing.

Later that evening, after he finished fixing the plumbing 
in the bar, he and his apprentice parked their pickup trucks 
in front of her house and left them there all night.

In Flanders Fields
By: Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae, MD (1872-1918)
Canadian Army

IN FLANDERS FIELDS the poppies blow
Between the crosses row on row,
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below.

We are the Dead. Short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
Loved and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields.

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields.

As a young man, Norton was an exceptional golfer.  At the age 
of 26, however, he decided to become a priest and joined a 
rather peculiar Order.  He took the usual vows of poverty and 
chastity, but his Order also required him to quit golf and never 
play again.  This was rather difficult for Norton, but he agreed 
and was finally ordained a priest. 

One Sunday morning the Reverend Father Norton woke up and, 
realizing it was an exceptionally beautiful and sunny, early 
spring day, decided he just had to play golf.  So, he told the 
Associate Pastor that he was feeling sick and convinced him to 
perform the sermon for him that day.  As soon as the Associate 
Pastor left the room, Father Norton headed out of town to a 
golf course about forty miles away.  This way, he knew he 
wouldn&#039;t accidentally meet anyone he knew from his parish. 

Setting up on the first tee, he was alone.  After all, it was 
Sunday morning and everyone else was in church.  At about 
this time, Saint Peter leaned over to the Lord while looking 
down from the heavens and said, "You&#039;re not going to let him 
get away with this, are you?" 

The Lord sighed and said, "No, I guess not." 

Just then Father Norton hit the ball and it shot straight toward 
the pin, dropping just short of it, rolled up and fell into the hole. 
IT WAS A 420 YARD HOLE IN ONE! 

Saint Peter was astonished.  He looked at the Lord 
and asked, "Why did you let him do that?" 

The Lord smiled and replied, "Who&#039;s he going to brag to?"

goes to Victor Marin, 20, of New York

Sent in by Deeli

<B>Not quite ready to give up his day job</b>
NEW YORK (UPI) -- A New York man whose home was burgled 
said the perpetrator was foiled when he returned to the scene of 
the crime to ask for his wallet back. 

Yaakov Kanelsky, 49, said the man who showed up at his door and 
said he had left his wallet inside claimed to have snuck into the 
apartment to use the bathroom, but the excuse seemed weak and 
the suspect eventually admitted to taking $200 from Kanelsky&#039;s 
bedroom, the New York Post reported Monday. 

"I didn&#039;t even know any money was missing," Kanelsky said. 
When he checked his bedroom he found the cash was indeed gone. 

Kanelsky told the man to return the money first and police arrived as 
the suspect, identified as Victor Marin, 20, was sliding the bills through 
the door one by one. Marin was charged with burglary, petty larceny 
and possession of stolen property.

My next-door neighbor and I frequently borrow things from 
each other.  Not long ago, when I requested his ladder, he told 
me he had lent it to his son.  Recalling a saying my grandmother 
used to repeat, I recited, "You should never lend anything to 
your kids, because you will never get it back." 

With that, my neighbor said, "Well, it&#039;s not even my ladder. 
It&#039;s my dad&#039;s."

Dear Ronnie
Yes, 7-Zip works fine too, even though it does not integrate
into the file explorer and disappear into the background quite
as smoothly as Winzip does. If I didn&#039;t have WinZip, I would
definitely use 7-Zip.

<B>Take a Break From Your Computer</b>
Avoid sitting in front of your computer for more than 30 minutes
at a time. If you find you lose track of time, set a timer to go
off in 30 minutes. Then get up, stretch, and walk around a bit
before sitting back down. It also helps ease eye strain if you
periodically look at distant objects.

<hr />

A college student wrote a letter home: 

Dear folks, 
I feel miserable because I have to keep writing for money. I feel 
ashamed and unhappy to have to ask for another hundred, but 
every cell in my body rebels. I beg on bended knee that you 
forgive me. 
Your son, Marvin. 

P.S. I felt so terrible I ran after the mailman who picked this up 
in the box at the corner. I wanted to take this letter and burn it. 
I prayed that I could get it back. But it was too late. 

A few days later he received a letter from his father. It said, 
"Your prayers were answered. Your letter never came."

goes to Thomas Pilaar, 34, of Denver, Colorado

Sent in by Deeli

<B>Library Thief</b>
DENVER (UPI) -- A Denver man is facing jail time and $53,549 
in library fines for checking out about 1,400 books and DVDs 
and selling many of them online, officials said. 

Thomas Pilaar, 34, received a 10-year prison sentence Tuesday 
for illegally selling library items on the Internet, The Denver Post reported. 

About 500 books and DVDs were found when Pilaar was arrested 
last year for a separate incident, the newspaper said. 

Officials said he used seven library cards to obtain the items from 
libraries in Denver, Douglas County, Aurora, Colo., and Littleton, Colo.

A man was reading the paper when an ad caught his eye: 
$100 Porsche! New! The man thought that it was very unusual to 
sell a Porsche for $100, and he thought it might be a joke or a typo. 
He soon decided it was worth a shot. He went to the lady&#039;s house 
and sure enough, she had an almost brand new Porsche. 

"Wow!" the man said. "Can I take it for a test drive?" 
Unlike what he expected, the man found that the car ran perfectly 
and took it back to the lady&#039;s house.

"Why are you selling me this great Porsche for only $100?"

"My husband just ran off with his secretary, and he told me I could 
have the house and the furniture as long as I sold his Porsche and 
sent him the money."

Dear Yolanda
Winzip reads rar files. 
You can also use Win-Rar from <a href="http://www.win-rar.com/" target="_blank" >http://www.win-rar.com/</a>
or a free trial from <a href="http://www.download.com/WinRAR/3000-2250_4-10007677.html" target="_blank" >http://www.download.com/WinRAR/3000-225 ... 07677.html</a>

There is no real reason to use RAR, except for pretending to be 
snooty and different. File compression is about the same as 
with ZIP, but RAR takes longer to compress and decompress than
ZIP does.

As we were moving into our dorm last fall, young women 
wandered from room to room to see what the other students 
had brought to school.  One student&#039;s room contained a TV, 
VCR, stereo system, microwave, and a number of other high-tech 
gadgets.  She even had a Nintendo.  A fellow dorm resident 
couldn&#039;t resist asking, "Do you play Nintendo?" 

The girl responded, "No, but guys do!"

No one who cannot rejoice in the discovery of his own mistakes 
deserves to be called a scholar.
--- Donald Foster

<hr />

I served with a guy who did a strange thing: He bounced an imaginary 
basketball wherever he went. Eventually, a psychiatrist labeled him 
unfit for duty, which led to a medical discharge. After the proceedings, 
he addressed the officer in charge. "Sir, may I approach?" 

With permission granted, he went through the motion of putting 
something on the officer&#039;s desk.

"What is this?" asked the officer.

"My basketball. I don&#039;t need it anymore."

goes to Chen Chenggang of Xin Dian, Taiwan 

<B>Rocky Sex</b>
Two lovers ended up in hospital in Taiwan after their car 
plunged 150ft down a cliff face as they made love in the 
back seat.

Lin Gu, 25, and lover Lee Shin, 29, were left with broken 
bones and bruises after their car toppled over the edge of 
a hill in XinDian, reports Today News.

A spokesman for police who were called by witnesses said: 
"They had parked up close to the edge of the mountain and had 
left the handbrake off.

"When they started having sex the rocking motion started the car 
moving and it rolled off the hill. They were lucky they were not more 
seriously hurt."

Despite their injuries - and being covered with mud and grass - the 
couple managed to clamber back up to the road where the woman 
asked the man to keep walking while she sought help at a nearby house.

Homeowner Chen Chenggang said the woman pleaded with him not 
to reveal how the accident happened as her husband "would definitely 
sue for divorce". However, that did not slow down a notorious gossip
like Chen Chenggang.

Thanks to Linda for this confession:

One night at a Japanese restaurant I was intrigued by some
Japanese writing on the side of one page in the menu. So I 
copied it onto the napkin and the next time I felt like embroidering,
I stitched it onto an otherwise rather boring turtleneck.

This Friday I wore it at a company dinner. While out on the 
balcony for an after dinner smoke, a Japanese gent approached 
me and asked me, if I knew what that writing said. 
I told him it was like an inside out fortune cookie and that I had 
no clue.

He told me it said: "Pretty good but really cheap!"

Re: Reducing file size of graphics
<i>
Dear Webby
Hi Webby:  I have a question.  I am trying to reduce the size 
of a color flyer I downloaded from a web site.  It is currently 
an 8 mg JPG and it need to be 4 or less to send on to a person 
who is going to place it in a magazine.   I am limited on 
editing programs, although, I have Microsoft picture Office 
Manager and I have a new laptop with Win Pic Live gallery, 
also picassa and Photoshop element.  However, I am limited 
in knowledge of Photoshop elements (just learning it now).   
Is there anyway I can reduce the size of this flyer?  It is also 
in a PDF format, but, that is even larger?  
Thank You, Di 
</i>
Dear Di
So as not to compromise quality, I would split that flier 
into two pieces.

If the magazine, that you are sending it to, uses low resolution 
or is an on-line magazine, then you can safely reduce the 
Dots Per Inch, which drastically cuts down the file size.

I use PSP for all graphics work, and if some printer requires 
PDF, I export it to PDF with Open Office,
then upload it to the web and send them the URL
They all seem to be quite happy about it, especially since that 
method does not plug up their email.
Have FUN!

Two rich men were talking over coffee and croissants at their country
club one day and one of them said to the other one, "Hey, I tell you
my driver is really stupid... you don&#039;t think so? Let me show you."

And he called his driver Ah Beng over and said, "Jim, here is a 10
dollar bill, go to the car showroom and buy me a Mercedes."

To which Jim replied, "Yes Sir! Right away!" and rushed off to the
showroom. The rich man turned to his friend and said, "See, I told you
he was stupid."

The other rich man said, "That&#039;s nothing, you want to see stupid, I
will show you stupid." And he called his driver, Ali: "Ali, go home
now and check to see if I&#039;m at home."

Ali said, "Yes Sir!! Right away, Sir" and ran home.

"See what I told you? He doesn&#039;t even have enough brains to know that
I cannot be at home if I am here."

Later on, the two drivers met on the road. Jim said to Ali, "Eh, you
know my boss is sooo stupid. He gave me 10 dollars and asked me to go
to the car showroom and buy him a Mercedes. Doesn&#039;t he know that
today is Sunday?? The showroom is closed!"

Ali replied, "You think he is stupid, huh? My boss is sooo much worse,
he asked me to go home to check if he is at home....He&#039;s got a
cellphone, right, he can just call home to check!

Drive-ins are almost extinct. There are only 400 of them left 
in the entire US. However, there are a few traveling Drive-Ins,
that tour around and can be booked as fund raisers. They are
extremely popular and you need to be there at least three hours
early, to get a spot. But you can smoke, and you can barbecue
on the tailgate.
Have FUN!

A farmer&#039;s wife was at her lawyer&#039;s getting advice
about a divorce.

"He makes excessive sexual demands on me, Mr. Jones."

"How do you mean?"

"Well, Mr. Jones," says the farmer&#039;s wife, "this
morning I was looking at the chickens, when he crept
up behind me and had me from behind!"

"Chickens? Mrs. Smith, I didn&#039;t know you kept
chickens."

"We don&#039;t, we were at the Kroger supermarket!"

Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy. 
--- Leo Buscaglia

<hr />

Thanks to Sandie for this story:
All of his life, Len had heard stories of an amazing family 
tradition. It seems that his father, grandfather and 
great-grandfather had all been able to walk on water on 
their 21st birthday. On that day, they&#039;d walk across the 
lake to the boat club for their first legal drink.

So, when Len&#039;s 21st birthday came around, he and his 
friend, Corky, took a boat out to the middle of the lake. 
Len stepped out of the boat and nearly drowned! Corky 
just managed to pull him to safety.

Furious and confused, Len went to see his grandmother.

"Grandma, it&#039;s my 21st birthday, so why can&#039;t I walk 
across the lake like my father, his father and his father 
before him?"

Granny looked Len straight in the eyes and said, 
"Because your father, grandfather and great- grandfather 
were born in January. You were born in July."

goes to the Orange County, California Sheriff&#039;s Dept.

<B>Massive police action at Annual Moon Over Amtrack event</b>

Sheriff&#039;s deputies told some 8,000 partiers to pull up their 
pants Saturday afternoon, shutting down the annual celebration 
known as "Moon Over Amtrak."

California Highway Patrol officers were called in to assist 
Orange County sheriff&#039;s deputies in shutting down the event, 
where thousands of people bared their rear ends to passing 
Metrolink and Amtrak trains, reported KNBC-TV in Los Angeles.

More than 50 law officers broke up the event because of 
complaints by a few sniveling ninnies about public nudity, 
said Orange County Sheriff&#039;s Department spokesman Jim Amormino.

"There were complaints about the mooning, women lifting their 
tops and a couple cases of complete nudity," Amormino said.
There were also reports of public alcohol consumption at the 
event, which has been prohibited in the past.

Amormino said the crowd dispersed peacefully when the mooning
was over, and no arrests were made.

The event originated in 1979, at the Mugs Away Saloon in Laguna Niguel, 
when K.T. Smith told friends he would buy a drink for anyone willing 
to run outside to the rail road tracks and moon the next train. Many of 
Smith&#039;s drinking buddies did, and the mooning tradition lived on -- 
although nowadays no one volunteers to buy drinks for the 
thousands of mooners who come out every year.

A cleric found himself wondering whether there were any golf 
courses in Heaven.  He even began to ask the question in his 
prayers.  One day, in answer to his prayers, he received a 
direct answer from on high. 

"Yes," said the Heavenly messenger, "There are many excellent 
golf courses in Heaven.  The greens are always in first class 
condition, the weather is always perfect and you always get to 
play with the very nicest people." 

"Oh, thank you," said the cleric, 
"That really is marvelous news." 

"Yes, isn&#039;t it?" replied the messenger, "And we have 
you scheduled for a foursome next Saturday."

Re: JPG versus JPEG
<i>
Dear Webby
Very short ask of you this time, it&#039;s what&#039;s the difference 
between JPG and JPEG.
 
Might be interesting to all your other &#039;devout&#039; readers too 
as some of them may be as "unschooled" in &#039;tech terms&#039; as I am.
 
I do know that I have read what jpg etc means but hasn&#039;t 
registered, just want to know the difference and which or 
what I should &#039;save as&#039;.
 
Regards to you and yours, thinking your dad will be hiking all 
about as the weather should be quite nice in his part of the 
world now, freezing here (well to me it is).
 
Regards Trish
</i>
Dear Trish
There is no difference.

JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the 
group that originally wrote the standard for JPG.

In the early days of computing, the UNIX and Windows 
world arbitrarily settled on 3 letter extensions, since the 
other, older graphics format: GIF also had 3 letters. 
The Mac side wanted to be snooty and different, 
and used the 4 letter JPEG extension.

The net originally was strictly UNIX, so JPG took hold 
and all software recognizes it, but nowadays most  
software also accepts the long 4 letter extension. 

It&#039;s just a matter of being snooty and wanting to appear 
different, like some women demanding to be addressed as Ms, 
not as Miss or Mrs. Well, I don&#039;t have time for a Ms, 
and I don&#039;t waste typing effort on a 4 letter name for a 
file, that works just fine when I call it jpg.

If your browser wants to save a file as jpg, even though 
some Ms may have called it jpeg before, let it.

The time to worry is when your browser tries to save a file as BMP.
That is the crude Windows Bitmap from the barefoot DOS 
days, that Windows shifts down to when it is just about crashed 
or doesn&#039;t have enough free memory to do things right. When 
you see it trying to save a file as BMP, quickly save everything 
that is open and close what is not absolutely necessary, then 
run CrapCleaner. After that it will save the file properly as JPG.

Have FUN!

Do you realize that the only time in our lives when we like to 
get old is when we&#039;re kids?  If you&#039;re less than ten years old, 
you&#039;re so excited about aging that you think in fractions. 
"How old are you?" 
"I&#039;m four and a half." 
You&#039;re never 36 and a half.  You&#039;re four and a half going on 5. 
You get into your teens; now they can&#039;t hold you back. 
You jump to the next number. "How old are you?" 
"I&#039;m gonna be 16." 
You could be 12, but you&#039;re gonna be 16. Eventually. 
Then the great day of your life; you become 21. 
Even the words sound like a ceremony.  You BECOME 21 . . . Yes! 
Then you turn 30. What happened there? Makes you sound like 
bad milk. He TURNED; we had to throw him out. What&#039;s wrong? 
What changed? You BECOME 21; you TURN 30. 
Then you&#039;re PUSHING 40 . . . stay over there.  You REACH 50. 
You BECOME 21; you TURN 30; You&#039;re PUSHING 40; 
you REACH 50; then you MAKE IT to 60. 
By then you&#039;ve built up so much speed, you HIT 70. 
After that, it&#039;s a day by day thing.  You HIT Wednesday . . . 
You get into your 80&#039;s; you HIT lunch, you HIT 4:30. 
My Grandmother won&#039;t even buy green bananas. "Well, it&#039;s 
an investment, you know, and maybe a bad one." 
And it doesn&#039;t end there . . . 
Into the 90&#039;s, you start going backwards. "I was JUST 92." 
Then a strange thing happens; if you make it over 100, 
you become a little kid again. "I&#039;m 100 and a half."

Waiting in a long, slow-moving line for security clearance at 
the Calgary International Airport in Canada, I was annoyed 
to hear a loud male voice behind me.  "Excuse me, excuse me," 
said the man as he pushed his way to the front.  "I want to 
make sure I get a good seat." 

I resolved not to let this line-jumper get ahead of me.  When 
I felt a tap on my shoulder, I whirled around, prepared to 
unleash a verbal assault that he would never forget . . . but 
found myself face to face with a smiling pilot.

An eighty year-old lady wins the lottery. Not wanting
her to die of shock upon learning this, her children
consult her doctor on how to break the news.

The doctor comes over to the lady&#039;s house. "What would
you do if you won ten million dollars?" he asks her.
The lady replies, "Why, since you&#039;ve been such a good
doctor to me, I would give half of it to you." The
doctor immediately died of shock.

goes to Steven Sprague, 48, of West Palm Beach, Fla.

<B>$9,500 Verizon bill</b>

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (UPI) -- A West Palm Beach, Fla., man 
is suing Verizon Wireless in state court after his family incurred a 
$9,500 wireless Internet bill in just 11 days. 

Steven Sprague, 48, said he was given a free wireless card for his 
laptop computer when he re-upped his two-year contract with 
Verizon and the suit claims he was told by a sales agent that 
the unlimited wireless card usage from his previous plan would 
carry over, the Palm Beach (Fla.) Post reported. 


However, the card was broken by Sprague&#039;s wife after only 11 days 
of use by the couple and their three children, ages 16, 12 and 8. 
Nonetheless, Sprague said, his bill for the month was nearly $9,500. 

"I was ticked off at her for breaking the card, but she was doing 
me the biggest favor in the world," he said. "At least it stopped there." 

Sprague said he took the bill to the Circuit City kiosk where he 
re-upped his contract and found the plan was not unlimited, but 
instead included a 49-cent surcharge for each megabyte over 
5 gigabytes of monthly use. 

"This case is either the classic bait-and-switch situation or, 
worst case, just a blatant attempt to get people in a contract 
where they don&#039;t know what they are getting into," said Sprague&#039;s 
lawyer, Philip Valente Jr. 
------------
$9,500 is by no means the biggest bill for wireless abuse, 
and there has been plenty of publicity about it over the last
few years. I realize that Verizon is not a prime choice of ISP,
mainly because of their email problems, but 25 Gigabytes in 
11 days is more file transfer, than a lot of very popular web 
sites do. Since fanatic abuse like that takes away capacity,
that otherwise 250 ordinary clients could use, I can understand
that Verizon has to draw a line somewhere and take a stand.

If Sprague wants more than 5 GB / month, he can sign up
for a business account. Whining and sniveling that a cheap
5 GB account has a per MB charge above 5 GB won&#039;t get
him anything except lawyer bills.

In July, the Indians asked their Chief if the coming
winter was going to be cold or not. Not really knowing
the answer, the chief replied that the winter will be
cold and that the members of the village should collect
wood to be prepared.Being a good leader, he then went
to a phone booth, called the National Weather Service
and asked, "Is this winter to be cold?"

The man on the phone responded, "This winter is indeed
going to be very cold."

So the Chief went back to encourage his people to collect
even more wood to be prepared. A week later he called the
National Weather Service again, and asked again, "Is it
going to be a very cold winter?"

"Yes," the man replied, "it&#039;s going to be a very cold
winter."

The Chief went back to his people and ordered them to
go out and bring back every scrap of wood they could
find.

Two weeks later he called the National Weather Service
again. "Are you absolutely sure that this winter is
going to be very cold?"

"Absolutely" the man replies, "the Indians are collecting
wood like crazy!"

Dear Eddie

Formatting always works.
That will teach the silly yahoos.

Upload their produced and collected data (spreadsheets, docs, 
pictures and music) to the net or to a DVD,  write down the serial 
numbers of all bought and paid for software, thenFormat and 
re-install Windows.
Download the SP3 blocker and the IE7 blocker from my toolbox, 
install a decent Anti-Virus and firewall, Spybot-Search&Destroy 
and Crap Cleaner.

Re-install the legitimate software, without any flaky registry 
screwers and speeder upper BS,
download the produced data, and it&#039;s done. 
The machine will be as fast as the day they bought it.

Anything else will just lead to ulcers and wasted time.

One day a man called the church office and said, 
"Can I speak to the head hog at the trough?" 

The secretary thought she heard what he said, 
but to be sure, she asked, "I&#039;m sorry, who?" 

The man said, "Can I speak to the head hog at the trough?" 

She said, "Well, if you mean the pastor, then you may refer 
to him as &#039;Pastor,&#039; or &#039;Brother,&#039; but you may certainly not 
refer to him as the &#039;head hog at the trough&#039;!" 

The man on the phone said, "Well, I was planning to donate 
ten thousand dollars to the church&#039;s building fund . . ." 

The secretary quickly responded, "Hang on, 
I think the old pig just waddled in!"

A customer in a bakery was observed carefully examining all the
rich-looking pastries displayed on trays in the glass cases.

A clerk approached him and asked, "What would you like?"

He answered, "I&#039;d like that chocolate-covered, cream-filled doughnut,
that jelly-filled doughnut and that cheese Danish."

Then with a sigh he added, "But I&#039;ll take an oat-bran muffin."

<B>Drunk Intruder</b>
LOS ANGELES (UPI) -- A 71-year-old Los Angeles woman said 
she was able to stop an attacker in her home from assaulting 
her daughter by offering him beer. 

Linda Dodson, 45, said a large man entered her room and attacked 
her at 3:37 a.m. Monday while her mother was sleeping in the next 
room, KTLA-TV, Los Angeles, reported. 

"He had his big hands ... on my throat, my mouth and my nose and 
I&#039;m flopping ... when he released his hand for a second, I just let out t
his blood-scorching scream," Dodson said. 

Dodson&#039;s mother said she came into her daughter&#039;s room to investigate 
the scream and jumped onto the attacker&#039;s back. However, she said she 
decided to switch tactics after the attacker threw her against a wall and 
grabbed her face so hard the lenses popped out of her glasses. 

"I just looked at him because I could tell he had been drinking and I said, &#039;
I don&#039;t know about you, but I could use a beer, how about you?&#039;" she said. 
"And he said yes." 

The mother and daughter took the suspect into their living room and gave 
him a beer, which seemed to calm him. Linda Dodson said she phoned 
911 after excusing herself to go to the bathroom and police arrived soon after. 

Louie Herrera, a convicted child molester, was arrested on suspicion of 
residential burglary, false imprisonment, and resisting arrest.

A man with a nagging secret couldn&#039;t keep it any longer.  In 
the confessional he admitted that he had been stealing building 
supplies for years from the lumberyard where he worked. 

"What did you take?" his priest asked. 

"Enough to build my own house and enough for my son&#039;s house. 
And houses for our two daughters and our cottage at the lake." 

"This is very serious," the priest said. "I shall have to think 
of a far-reaching penance.  Have you ever done a retreat?" 

"No, Father, I haven&#039;t," the man replied. "But, 
if you got the blueprint, I can get the lumber."

Dear Webby,
I finally got my modem, and am now flying instead of crawling. 
I need to pick your brain again. Can you  recommend a good 
virus protector? Earthlink, has the latest Norton, that I can try 
free for 30 days, and then pay $8-9. month after that. Is Norton 
a good choice, or do you know of a better one. My Grandkids 
use my pc, and I can&#039;t be in the room with them every min. 
and while they may be computer savy, the two youngest are to 
quick to click on things they shouldn&#039;t.  I would greatly appreciate 
any advice you you can send me.
Take care and be happy.

I use McAfee Virus Scan and Firewall
and have used it for over 20 years.
It&#039;s around $30 a year.

Norton used to be pretty good, but nowadays I would not use it for 
a business machine. It does some weird stuff and is difficult to 
remove cleanly.

One rainy evening, my husband, John, and I emerged from a
restaurant only to find that he had locked the keys in
the car.  He insisted he could open the door with a wire
coat hanger, so we went back to the restaurant to get one.
There were none to be found.

John then ran to a department store a quarter-mile away
and returned with a hanger.  After a few attempts, he got
the door open and we climbed in.  As we sat there, soaked
and cold, John stuck the hanger under his seat.  With a
smug grin, he said, "Now if this ever happens again, I&#039;ll
have one."

<font color="#009990">
<B>Keeping Cool on Hot Days</b>
When it&#039;s really hot and you don&#039;t have air conditioning, try
putting together this frugal "swamp cooler".  Fill a bowl up with
cool water and set it in front of a fan so the fan blows air over
the top of the water.  Toss some ice cubes in the water
occasionally to help keep it cool.

Visit ThriftyFun For More Cooling Tips By Clicking Here
<a href="http://www.thriftyfun.com/Home%20Improvement_Cooling_574_582.html" target="_blank" >http://www.thriftyfun.com/Home%20Improv ... 4_582.html</a>

<font color="blue">
Actually, it is better if you skip the ice cubes. The most cooling 
happens from evaporating the water, from making it change it&#039;s 
state from liquid to vapor. Cooling the water hinders that.
The more water you evaporate, the more you cool the house.
A wet curtain on the window, where the wind blows IN, can cool
your place as fast as any air conditioning, if you have a 
good breeze blowing through.

It takes only 1 calorie to warm 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius,
but it takes 450 calories to make it change it&#039;s state from 
liquid to vapor. If the water is warm and if the surface area 
is large, more evaporation happens, but it still takes 450
calories per gram of water to make it happen.

A fuzzy, loose weave curtain or an old afghan, 
with very warm water on it, and a good breeze of dry air, 
will cause the most cooling.

However, if it is already humid, forget it. 
Evaporative cooling needs dry air to be effective.

Have FUN!

A clergyman, walking down a country lane, sees a young farmer 
struggling to load hay back onto a cart after it had fallen off. 
"You look hot, my son," said the cleric.  "Why don&#039;t you rest a 
moment, and I&#039;ll give you a hand." 

"No thanks," said the young man. "My father wouldn&#039;t like it." 

"Don&#039;t be silly," the minister said. "Everyone is entitled 
to a break.  Come and have a drink of water." 

Again the young man protested that his father would be upset. 
Losing his patience, the clergyman said, "Your father must be 
a real slave driver.  Tell me where I can find him and I&#039;ll give 
him a piece of my mind!" 

And the young farmer said, "Well, he&#039;s under the load of hay."

Thanks to Connie for this story:
A man is at work one day when he notices that his co-worker 
is wearing an earring.  This man knows his co-worker to be a 
normally conservative fellow, and is curious about his sudden 
change in &#039;fashion sense.&#039; 

The man walks up to him and says, &#039;I didn&#039;t know you were 
into earrings.&#039; 

&#039;Don&#039;t make such a big deal, it&#039;s only an earring,&#039; he replies 
sheepishly. 

His friend falls silent for a few minutes, but then his curiosity 
prods him to say, &#039;So, how long have you been wearing one?&#039; 

&#039;Ever since my wife found it in my truck&#039;

goes to William Vickers, 46, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio

Sent in by Deeli

<B>Helpful Burglar</b>
CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio (UPI) -- Police in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 
said they arrested a suspected serial burglar after he stopped to offer 
assistance to two officers. 

The police said William Vickers, 46, stopped at about 1 a.m. 
Sunday to offer assistance to two officers who were attempting 
to help a woman who had locked herself out of her car, the 
Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Tuesday. 

The officers told Vickers they had the situation well in hand 
but as the seemingly good Samaritan began walking away 
and into the light of a street lamp, one of the officers 
recognized him as a suspect in the After Midnight Burglar case. 

Vickers is suspected of multiple burglaries four years ago as 
well as a break-in reported last week. Police fliers posted 
around the city bear the suspect&#039;s face. 

"It was nice of Willie to offer to help, and he probably has 
more experience getting into cars than our two officers on 
the scene," Police Chief Martin Lentz said. 

However, Vickers, who allegedly fought against the officers 
and damaged the woman&#039;s car, now faces multiple charges 
including burglary, assault on a police officer and resisting 
arrest. He was being held in Cleveland Heights Jail.

Bambi, a young cutie, sidled up to a guest at
the party.  She had heard him addressed as
doctor and now she said diffidently, "Doctor,
may I ask a question?"

"Certainly," he said.

"Lately," said Bambi, "I have been having a funny
pain right here under the heart..."

The guest interrupted uncomfortably and said,
"I&#039;m terribly sorry, Bambi, but the truth is, I&#039;m a
doctor of philosophy."

"Oh," said the blonde, "I&#039;m sorry!"  She turned
away, but then overcome with curiosity, she
turned back. "Just one more question, doctor.
Tell me, what kind of disease is philosophy?"

Re: Why $90 ransom for XP?
<i>
Dear Webby:
Why does Dell charge $90 more if you want XP, and why can&#039;t
you buy the machines without them poisoned with Vista? I don&#039;t
see why I can&#039;t have a machine without that dumpsterware on it.
Charlene
</i>
Dear Charlene
In their attempts to lie and cheat about Vista usage, Microsoft
requires OEMs to preload computers with Vista, or else they
will lose their OEM status. Even though you and almost 
everybody else will do the initial start up with the XP CD in the
CD drive and format Vista off it, without ever running it, 
Microsoft still reports it as one more Vista machine.

The reason Dell charges $90 more for the XP CD is becuse
they can get away with it. It is simple extortion and has nothing
to do with cost. They know you want XP, and that you will 
pay the $90 ransom. It&#039;s cheaper than suing them, 
and it&#039;s still cheaper than a Toshiba.

Have FUN!

After pulling a farmer over for speeding, a state trooper started to
lecture him about his speed, pompously implying that the farmer
didn&#039;t know any better and trying to make him feel as uncomfortable
as possible.

He finally started writing out the ticket, but had to keep swatting
at some flies buzzing around his head.

The farmer said, "Having some problems with circle flies there, 
are ya?"

The trooper paused to take another swat and said, "Well, yes, if
that&#039;s what they are. I&#039;ve never heard of circle flies."

The farmer was pleased to enlighten the cop. "Circle flies are common
on farms. They&#039;re called circle flies because you almost always find
them circling the back end of a horse."

The trooper continues writing for a moment, then says," Hey, are you
trying to call me a horse&#039;s behind?"

"Oh no, officer." The farmer replies. "I have too much respect for
law enforcement and police officers for that."

"That&#039;s a good thing," the officer says rudely, then goes back to
writing the ticket.

After a long pause, the farmer added, "Hard to fool them flies,
though."

goes to a naked nut in Las Vegas

Sent in by Ross

<B>Naked man arrested after hijacking Las Vegas bus</b>
 The Associated Press | Wednesday, Jul 9 2008 7:56 AM

Maybe he lost his shirt at a casino. Police in Las Vegas say 
they arrested a naked man who stole a beer and then hijacked 
a bus several miles northeast of the Strip.

A police spokesman says the man fled from a convenience store 
when an officer arrived to investigate a report of a shoplifter Tuesday.
The man allegedly punched in a back window of a Citizens Area 
Transit bus, climbed aboard, forced the driver off, drove the bus 
about 200 yards and then jumped off the moving vehicle.

A police officer climbed aboard the bus and stopped the vehicle.
Police say the man was arrested on felony charges and given 
clothes and a mental evaluation.

A butcher just out of trade school in Canada applies for and
gets a job, skinning and cutting up the kills of local hunters.
The first job he gets is to cut up a moose to put in the freezer.
He finally gets the moose cut up and is putting it into bags and
marking them with the contents: chops, rump steak, ribs, sirloin,
etc, etc.

When he finishes with the stuff he knows, he is still left with
a pile of unidentifiable parts.

At a loss as to what to do with them, he finally puts them all
into one bag and labels them..........Moosellaneous.

Dear Webby:
I have windows XP Home operating system and lately , whenever 
I start up the computer I get a little window that says 
"Application Error - GUI.exe  The application failed to initialise 
properly (0x0000022) Click OK to terminate the application."  
Don&#039;t know what it is on about and when I click OK all continues

integral to the operating system? 
 
Thanks for your help once again!!

Dear Cheryl
That is just spyware reporting what size bra you order 
and what you do at the bank. And it opens a back door for other 
people to enter your computer and use it for spamming.

gui.exe is a process belonging to an advertising program by 
searchnugget.com. This process monitors your browsing habits 
and distributes the data back to the author&#039;s servers for analysis. 
This also prompts advertising popups. This process is a security 
risk and should be removed from your system. 

Somebody apparently agreed to carrying it on the computer as a 
small print condition for getting some "free" stuff. Because of that 
agreement, makers of programs, that remove it automatically, 
can be sued. 

Big companies like McAfee, that have big herds of staff lawyers, 
kill it anyway. You can also try Spybot-Search&Destroy. It is free. 
If that doesn&#039;t do it, use McAfee.

Have FUN!

At checkout at electronic or home improvement stores, the clerk
will always offer you an additional warranty. Only buy products
that have good warranties in the first place, and say "No" when a
checker offers you an impulse warranty on electronics. Also, your

goes to Carlos Tanner of Hillsborough County, Florida

Sent in by Sandie

<B>Deputy Accused Of Terrorizing Wife With Taser</b>
 
Tuesday, July 08, 2008 10:48:01 AM 
DOVER -- Hillsborough County Sheriff&#039;s deputy Carlos Tanner was 
arrested Monday morning for allegedly using his police weapons 
on his wife.

Deputies said the two were involved in a dispute when Tanner 
used the Taser on his wife three times, causing burns on her stomach.

Tanner is also accused of placing his service weapon, a silver 
automatic handgun, to her head for 10 seconds.

After the alleged attack, Tanner&#039;s wife ran to a friend&#039;s house to call 911.

"They always, always went to church, attended church regularly. 
They were faithful people, so I&#039;m just shocked," said Doris Randall, 
a family friend.

One of Tanner&#039;s fellow deputies came out to his home and arrested him.

Tanner is being held in the Hillsborough County jail with no bond. He has 
been placed on administrative leave without pay.

Kids!
- It now costs more to amuse a child than it once did to educate his
father.

- It rarely occurs to teenagers that the day will come when they&#039;ll know
as little as their parents.

- Money isn&#039;t everything, but it sure keeps the kids in touch.

- Never lend your car to anyone to whom you have given birth.

- You can learn many things from children ... like how much patience you have.

- The first sign of maturity is the discovery that the volume knob also
turns to the left.

- There are three ways to get things done:  1) do it yourself 2) hire
someone to do it 3) forbid your kids to do it

- Those who say they "sleep like a baby" haven&#039;t got one.

- There would be fewer problems with children if they had to chop wood
to keep the television set going.

Re: Last Windows Update has a bug
<i>
Dear Webby:
Just rec&#039;d this from a friend- if it&#039;s true, might be worth a 
humor letter note.
________________________________________-

If you&#039;re religious about letting Microsoft update your PC -- 
and you use ZoneAlarm -- your system might not let you 
access the Internet. 

Tuesday&#039;s update from Microsoft included KB951748, 
a fix for a Domain Name System (DNS) security flaw in Windows XP. 

Using ZoneAlarm? Don&#039;t install the KB951748 update.

What&#039;s The Problem?
The update conflicts with the free version of ZoneAlarm, 
so if you install the update, the next time you boot the system, 
you won&#039;t have Internet access. 

There&#039;s a simple enough work-around -- uninstall the update. 
Some users have changed ZoneAlarm&#039;s settings from high to 
medium in order to resolve the problem. That&#039;s easy, sure, 
but not if you&#039;re locked out of the Internet and can&#039;t read this. 

If you have a buddy that you know uses ZA, do something 
you haven&#039;t done since discovering e-mail: Give him or her 
a call (they&#039;ll undoubtedly be surprised and probably won&#039;t 
recognize your voice). 

<a href="http://stonecarver.com">Walter</a>

</i>
Thanks Walter!
I got a few letters from people today, who had to restore
Windows to before Tuesday&#039;s bug fix update.This seems
to explain why they had to do that.

I know it was a sloppy update that didn&#039;t re-start everything
that had been running, but I didn&#039;t realize just how sloppy
it was.

Have FUN!
Dear Webby

For heavily wrinkled jeans, iron them on a damp towel.  It will
create steam on both sides and iron the jeans much faster.  This
also works well on thick cotton clothing, like sweatshirts.

A teacher asked her students to draw a picture of their favorite Old
Testament story, and as she moved around the class, she saw there
were many wonderful drawings being done. Then she came across
Johnny who had drawn an old man driving an old car. In the back seat
were two passengers, both scantily dressed.

"It&#039;s a lovely picture," said the teacher, "but which story does it
tell?"

Johnny seemed surprised at the question. "Well," he exclaimed,
"doesn&#039;t it say in the BIBLE that God drove Adam and Eve out of
the Garden of Eden in a Fury? That&#039;s a Plymouth Fury just like
our neighbor has on blocks in front of his trailer!"

Thanks to Roland for this report:
My son, Scott, an insurance broker in Florida, loves ocean fishing and 
takes his cell phone along on the boat. One morning we were drifting 
about ten miles offshore as Scott discussed business on the phone. 
Suddenly his rod bent double, and the reel screamed as line poured 
off the spool. 

Scott was master of the situation. "Pardon me," he told his customer 
calmly. "I have a call on another line."

Woman Shoots Herself While Trying to Kill Mice 
Tuesday, July 08, 2008 
POTTER VALLEY, Calif. �  A Mendocino County woman who was trying 
to kill mice in her trailer with a gun ended up shooting herself and another 
person. 

The 43-year-old woman pulled out her .44-caliber Magnum revolver after 
she saw the mice scurrying across the floor of her trailer on Highway 20 
in Potter Valley, sheriff&#039;s officials said. 

But she accidentally dropped the gun, which went off as it struck the floor. 
The bullet went through the woman&#039;s kneecap, bounced off the keys sitting 
on the belt loop of a 42-year-old man in the trailer and grazed the man&#039;s 
groin before ending up in his coin pocket. 

Authorities did not release the shooting victims&#039; names. 

The mice escaped the shooting unharmed, but PETA claims that
the noise caused severe emotional trauma to the mice and was 
cruelty to the animals.

Woman to her fiancee: "When we get married, I want to share 
all your worries, troubles and lighten your burden."

"That&#039;s very kind of you, darling. But I don&#039;t have any worries 
or troubles."

"That&#039;s because we aren&#039;t married yet!"

Re: Connecting in hotels
<i>
Dear Webby:
hello, as always thank you for the humor, always love it. I have a 
question about my daughters laptop, how does that work  at most 
motels? I am not sure if the one we are going to is wireless or not. 
If yes, then should pick up signal and be able to use the net correct? 
If it doesnt have wireless, do I need to get internet provider to be able 
to use it? This wireless stuff is all new to me. thanks for the help
Tam

Dear Tam
When I prepare for a trip, I book all hotels and motels over the Internet.
When you select a hotel and check up on it, you see if they have high 
speed Internet. They always mention it, if they got it.

As a rule of thumb, 4* and 5* always have wireless high speed,
3* sometimes has wireless, sometimes just data ports. (Dial-Up)
2 star has a charge per call or directions to a pay-phone.

Personally, if they don&#039;t have high speed Internet and smoking rooms, 
then they are not good enough for me. There usually is a satisfactory 
hotel or motel a block further.

The better hotels have a card with log-on instructions and the password 
on the table or glued onto the power bar. If they don&#039;t, call the front desk
and ask for it.

When your wireless finds the signal, or when you plug in a network cable,
and THEN open a browser, (-don&#039;t open one before that! -), the browser
will be hijacked to the log-on page. 

Once you are logged in, you get control of the browser back and can do
anything you can do at home.

If a hotel or motel does not hve high sped Internet, then you have 
to use dial-up to an account that you already have. 
I have an Earthlink dial-up account, just in case some disaster
strands me between towns, that have High Speed Internet. That
has been my traveling account for about 14 years now. It comes in
hande at least once or twice a year, when the DSL in some hotel
malfunctions or is overloaded. No problem, I just dial up via
Earthlink and send the Humor Letter out that way.

Have FUN!

A wife says to her husband one weekend morning, "We&#039;ve got
such a clever dog. He brings in the daily newspapers every
morning."

Her husband replied, "Well, lots of dogs can do that."

The wife responded, "But we&#039;ve never subscribed to any papers!"

The class assignment in composition was to write about
something unusual that happened during the past week.
Little Ben got up to read his. "The neighbor fell in the well last
week - " he began.

"Good heavens," shrieked Mrs. Krup, the teacher. "Is he all
right now?"

"He must be," said little Ben. "He stopped yelling yesterday."

Thanks to Jai for this story:
An Amish lady is trotting down the road in her horse and buggy 
when she is pulled over by a cop.

"Ma&#039;am, I&#039;m not going to ticket you, but I do have to issue you 
a warning. You have a broken reflector on your buggy."

"Oh, I&#039;ll let my husband, Jacob, know as soon as I get home."

"That&#039;s fine. Another thing, ma&#039;am. I don&#039;t like the way that 
one rein loops across the horse&#039;s back and around one of 
his testicles. I consider that animal abuse. That&#039;s cruelty to 
animals. Have your husband take care of that right away!"

Later that day, the lady is home telling her husband about 
her encounter with the cop.

"Well, dear, what exactly did he say?"

"He said the reflector is broken."

"I can fix that in two minutes. What else?"

"I&#039;m not sure, Jacob. . .
something about the emergency brake."

goes to Lynne Rice, 74, of Norwalk, California

<B>Woman drives car into store </b>

NORWALK, Calif. (UPI) -- An elderly California woman was 
arrested after she allegedly drove her car into the windows 
of a convenience store and then tried to buy beer, police said. 

Lynne Rice, 74, is accused of driving her 1988 Cadillac into 
the front windows of Joe&#039;s Food Mart, said Lt. Jenny Ha of 
the Norwalk Sheriff&#039;s Station. 

Officials said damages from the Sunday crash total about $8,000. 

The store owner said after the 112-pound woman crashed into the 
store she got out of the car and tried to buy a six-pack of Bud. 

Rice allegedly shoved the cashier when he refused to make the sale, 
the Long Beach (Calif.) Press-Telegram reported. 

Ha said no injuries were reported in the incident, but Rice received 
medical treatment for an existing health problem. 

Rice was released Sunday from the Norwalk Sheriff&#039;s Station on 
$15,000 bail after being arrested on suspicion of drunken driving, 
the newspaper said.

Three little boys were concerned because they couldn&#039;t get
anyone to play with them. They decided it was because they
had not been baptized and didn&#039;t go to Sunday school. So
they went to the nearest church. But only the janitor was
there.

One said, "We need to be baptized because no one will come
out and play with us. Will you baptize us?"

"Sure," said the janitor. He took them into the bathroom and
dunked their heads in the toilet bowl, one at a time. Then
he said, "Now, go out and play."

When they got outside, dripping wet, one of them asked, "What
religion do you think we are?"

The oldest one said, "We&#039;re not Catholic, because they pour
the water on you. We&#039;re not Baptist because they dunk all of
you in it. We&#039;re not Methodist because they just sprinkle you."

The littlest one said, "Didn&#039;t you smell that water?"

"Yes. Why, what do you think that means?"

"That means we&#039;re &#039;piscopalians."

After the Fourth of July the nursery school teacher took
the opportunity to tell her class about patriotism. "We live in a great
country," she said. "One of the things we should be happy is that, in
this country, we are all free." 

One little boy came walking up to her from the back of the room.
He stood with his hands on his hips and said,
"I&#039;m not free.  I&#039;m four."

The company I work for offers tours through the historic
district of Annapolis, Maryland, led by guides dressed in
Colonial clothing. While leading a group, Felix, one of
our guides, tripped and fell, breaking his wrist.

He went to the hospital, and as he sat waiting in the
emergency room, a policeman walked by.  Doing a double
take at Felix in his 18th-century garb, he asked, "Just
how long have you been waiting?"

Thanks too SSS for this confession:
First I had  to work late. Then I discovered that I&#039;d locked 
my keys in the car. But the last straw was learning that 
roadside service couldn&#039;t get a locksmith to me for at least 
two hours. Finally the guy showed, looking exhausted.

As he struggled with my door, I joked, "Do those Slim Jim

"Yeah," he muttered. "They&#039;re called keys."

goes to Ricardo Gonzalez, 35, of Midlothian, Illinois

Sent in by Sandie
<B>Caged kids</b>

Fri Jul 4, 1:47 AM ET 
A suburban Chicago man locked his two young daughters in a 
wire cage hidden in the backseat of his pickup truck because he 
didn&#039;t have a baby sitter, officials said Thursday.

Ricardo Gonzalez, 35, of Midlothian, was arrested Monday 
after a woman at a gas station in Posen heard a crying child 
and spotted him pushing small hands back into a cage, police said.

He had a wire cage behind the front seats of his truck, police said. 
Black-tinted windows and a large plywood board in the back window 
concealed it.

Gonzalez told police he used the cage because he didn&#039;t have a 
baby sitter. He also said he wanted to control the girls, ages 2 and 5, 
so they wouldn&#039;t wander away. 

Police said the girls did not live in the cage.

Gonzalez will appear in court July 31 on charges of misdemeanor 
child endangerment. Cook County prosecutors were exploring 
Thursday whether the charge could be upgraded to a felony.

The children were turned over to the state child welfare agency 
and placed in foster care Monday.

Agency spokesman Kendall Marlowe said the department was 
investigating abuse allegations against the father. It had previously 
found the mother neglectful and provided unspecified 
"supportive services" to the family.

-----------------------
It seems ironic that Gonzalez probably meant well, but just didn&#039;t
have a clue about how to deal with the kids. A cargo net to keep
the little escape artists from unbuckling and wandering around the 
gas station is one thing, but a cage is getting a bit carried away.

Joe&#039;s wife likes to sing so she decided to join the church 
choir. From time to time she would practice while she was 
in the kitchen preparing dinner. Whenever she would start 
in on a song, Joe would head outside to the porch.

His wife, with hurt feelings, said, "What&#039;s the matter, 
Joe? Don&#039;t you like my singing?"

Joe replied, "Honey, I love your singing, but I just want 
to make sure the neighbors know I&#039;m not beating you."

Re:Lost Favorites
<i>
Dear Webby:
I have a big problem this time...somehow my "My Favorites" 
has disappeared...I have run "search" and it didn&#039;t find it.  
I did run Regcure the other day but didn&#039;t need "MF" until today....
could that have wiped it out?  Is there someway this can be 
retrieved.  Any help will be gratefully received.  
Ann
</i>
Dear Ann
Are you beginning to see why I don&#039;t recommend regcure 
and similar stuff?

I don&#039;t know of any way to retrieve lost IE favorites, that is why 
I frequently recommend saving them to a file. 
Just remember:
ALT FINE

If you do that once a week, you bookmarks are never too far 
out of date and can be IMPORTED into the Favorites again..
Just in case you DID at one time do that when I mentioned 
it in the Humor Letter, do a search for "bookmark". If you find 
a bookmark.html or bookmark.txt, you can import them into 
your Favorites.

Have FUN!

The kindergarten teacher was aghast at the words one of her
charges was using.

Taking him aside, she tried to exercise care and good
judgment, but was intent on nipping this kind of language in the
bud.

"Where in the world did you ever hear anybody talking like that,
anyway?" she asked.

"In our car this morning," he answered cheerfully. "When Daddy
was trying to hurry and drive me to school."

"Well," she said. "I&#039;m sure you don&#039;t know what it means, dear,
but you must never use that language again."

"But I do know what it means," he said. 
"It means the car won&#039;t start."

Rescuers removed a man who was accidentally dumped into a 
Rumpke Truck on July 4, 2008 (WKRC-TV) 
A man is taken to the hospital after being dumped into a Rumpke 
Garbage truck. This happened at the UDF station at Beechmont 
and Elstun in Anderson Township around 10:30 this morning. 

The man climbed into the dumpster to get out of the rain. The 
garbage truck picked up the load without realizing that the man 
had moved in. 

He was taken from the truck by members of the Fired Department, 
using a ladder truck and stretcher, and was checked out at 
the hospital.

Re:Gray Squares istead of pictures
<i>
Dear Webby:
I don&#039;t know if this is the proper way to ask a question. 
I don&#039;t seem to be able to see pictures included in most 
emails. I am able to see the ones in your letter each 
morning, but in all other emails, all I can see is gray 
squares where the pictures should be. There are no 
attachments shown in the headers, either. I have looked 
in Internet Options but can&#039;t see anything that would 
apply. I also restored my computer to a time 2 weeks 
back when I was still able to see pictures. Do you know 
of any setting I may have inadvertently messed up?
Carol
</i>
Dear Carol
If you still see my pictures, your settings are OK.
Don&#039;t mess with them!

I too get occasional mail with gray squares from 
people who don&#039;t know how to embed pictures. 
Usually they use Incredimail or Outlook Depressed. 
A red X means there is no picture with THAT name.
A gray square means that they have that picture, but
didn&#039;t embed it properly.

IF you think their pictures are worth the hassles, you 
can tell them to write to the Express Empress at
<a href="mailto:080701@fire-cat.com" target="_blank" >080701@fire-cat.com</a>
and ask her how to properly embed pictures so that 
the pictures come through, instead of the gray squares.

The new school librarian decided that instead of checking out
children&#039;s books by writing the names of borrowers on the book
cards herself, she would have the youngsters sign their own names.
She would then tell them they were signing a "Contract" for
returning the books on time.

Her first customer was a second grader, who looked surprised to
see a new librarian. He brought four books to the desk and shoved
them across to the librarian, giving her his name as he did so.

The librarian pushed the books back and told him to sign them out.
The boy laboriously printed his name on each book card and then
handed them to her with a look of utter disgust.

Before the librarian could even start her speech he said, scornfully,
"That other Librarian we had, she could write!"

The florist&#039;s son brought the teacher a bouquet of flowers.
The candy-store owner&#039;s daughter gave the teacher a pretty box of candy.
Then the liquor-store owner&#039;s son brought up a big, heavy box. The teacher
lifted it up and noticed that it was leaking a little bit. She touched a
drop of the liquid with her finger and tasted it. "Is it wine?" she
guessed. 
"No," the boy replied. 
She tasted another drop and asked, "Champagne?" 
"No," said the little boy... 
"I give up," she said. "What is it?" 
The boy replied, "It&#039;s a puppy!"

<hr />

A new hair salon opened up for business right across the street 
from the old established hair cutters&#039; place.

They put up a big bold sign which read:
"WE GIVE SEVEN DOLLAR HAIR CUTS!"

Not to be outdone, the old Master Barber put up his own sign:
"WE FIX SEVEN DOLLAR HAIR CUTS"

I had received the Beer Store and the Pot of Gold pictures

goes to Lasse Jonsson, of Malmoe, Sweden

<B>Most ridiculous commuter</b>
Fri Jul 4, 10:14 AM ET

STOCKHOLM (AFP) - A man deemed to have the shortest and 
"most ridiculous commute" in Malmoe has won a bicycle as 
part of a campaign to reduce car traffic in the southern Swedish 
city , an organiser said Friday.

"A man called Lasse Jonsson won the contest after his girlfriend 
Anna Holm signed him up. He drives his car every day less than 
200 metres (650 feet) between his home and workplace, and 
also drives another few hundred metres to lunch," Sara Forslund 
told AFP.

Forslund is one of the organisers of Malmoe&#039;s municipal campaign 
called "No ridiculous car journeys".

A murder has been committed. Police are called to an apartment
and find a woman standing, holding a 5-iron in his hands, looking
at the lifeless body of a man on the floor.

The detective asks, "Sir, is that your husband?"

"Yes."

"Did you hit him with that golf club?"

"Yes. Yes, I did," the woman answers. She stifles a sob, drops
the club and puts her hands on her head.

"How many times did you hit her?"

"I don&#039;t know. Five . . . six . . . put me down for a five."

<b>From the Tech Support Pits:</b>

Re:Cool computers are faster
<i>
No Questions today, so I&#039;ll write about a timely concern.
</i>

In summer it is even more important to keep your computer
cool. When the CPU heats up, it shifts to a slower speed,
and the fans in the computer shift to higher speeds. That
not only cranks up the power bill, but it attracts more dust
bunnies into the computer, which compounds the problem.

If you want to speed up your computer, don&#039;t constipate
it with speeder-upper and registry messer programs, 
just turn it off, open the cover, and vacuum it out.
Depending on how long you have neglected it, you may
have to pop the fan shrouds and go after the heat sinks
with Q-Tips or pipe cleaners. Nowadays the fan shrouds are
just snap fit and don&#039;t require any tools to pop them off.

The heat sink underneath the fan shroud is the key to cooling.
If it is not clean and bright and shiny, it is not transferring
the CPU heat to the air properly. Even though the heat sink is
usually removable, it&#039;s not a good idea to take it off and tossing
it into the dishwasher. If you do take it off, you will notice a 
white, sticky mess on the back of it. That is heat sink grease,
which fills the microscopic gaps and low spots between the
CPU and the heat sink and ensures that the entire CPU is
cooled, and not just three high spots. 

If you do remove the heat sink, you have to clean the now 
hardened heat sink grease off it and apply a fresh dab of it to it, 
before putting it back onto the CPU. Every electronics store 
sells it, and it&#039;s no big deal to put a little dab of grease onto it, 
but if you don&#039;t have any heat sink grease handy, 
then don&#039;t take the heat sink off. Just clean it where it is. 

Q-Tips and fuzzy pipe cleaners work best. If you need to
use liquid, rubbing alcohol, gas line anti-freeze or lock-de-icer
work best. 

Five minutes of cleaning can make a very noticeable difference
in your computer&#039;s performance.

By the way, set your hard drives and monitor to turn off after
5 minutes of inactivity. When you are not actively using the
machine, they are just dumb heaters. You don&#039;t need a screen
saver to amuse the cat or the dust bunnies, and you don&#039;t really
need them to give the air conditioning an extra 150 Watts worth
of heat to remove. You pay for the 150 Watts of heating, and
probably twice that for the air conditioner to get rid of it.

Have FUN!

Three women died and went to heaven. At the gate they met 
St. Peter who asked them how they died.

Woman 1: St. Peter I have always been a good woman. I was 
happily married and I never had an outside relationship. One 
day I went for a walk and my heart gave out on me.

St. Peter: Bless you my child. Take the golden key and go the 
golden door. Your reward will be with you soon.

Woman 2: St Peter I was also a good woman, but I cheated on 
my husband a couple of times. I went out one day to meet my 
lover and was killed in a car crash.

St. Peter: Forgiveness is a part of life here. Take the silver key 
and go to the silver door. Your reward will be with you soon.

Woman 3: St Peter, I had sex with everybody. I loved it so much. 
One of my lovers caught me betraying him and killed me.

St. Peter: Take this key and go to my door, I will be there with you soon.

A police officer in a small town stopped a motorist who was
speeding down Main Street.

"But officer." the man began, "I can explain".

"Just be quiet," snapped the officer. "I&#039;m going to let you
cool your heels in jail until the chief gets back..."

"But officer, I just wanted to say...."

"And I said to keep quiet! You&#039;re going to jail!"

A few hours later the officer looked in on his prisoner and
said, "Lucky for you that the chief is at his daughter&#039;s wedding.
He&#039;ll be in a good mood when he gets back."

"Don&#039;t count on it," answered the fellow in the cell. 
"I&#039;m the groom."

Jolene had been wanting new kitchen cabinets for a long time, 
but her husband insisted they were an extravagance.

Then she went to visit her mother for two weeks and when 
she returned, she was overjoyed to find that her husband 
had surprised her by installing beautiful new cabinets.

A few days later, a neighbor came over to visit and after 
admiring the new cabinets, the neighbor added, 
"All of us were so glad the fire your husband had while 
you were gone was confined to the kitchen."

goes to Phillip Boucher, 45, of St Cathrines, Ontario

<B>Failed bridge jump causes thousands in damage</b>
 
The St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corp. said it will cost hundreds, 
if not thousands, of dollars to replace a bridge warning gate that a driver 
crashed through on Canada Day. 

But it says the real cost was to the Queenston Street drivers trying to 
cross the Homer Bridge, which was closed for hours Tuesday. 
"The greatest inconvenience was to the general public," said Seaway 
spokesperson Andrew Bogora. 

A 45-year-old St. Catharines man was charged with dangerous operation 
of a motor vehicle after he tried to jump his car over the bridge as it was 
being raised. 

Witnesses said the Buick LeSabre accelerated through the warning gate 
Tuesday around 7 a. m., and continued racing up the bridge as it was lifting. 
As the span rose, the car started to slide backwards and the driver jumped out. 

The Buick slid backwards and disappeared through the gap between the 
bridge deck and the road, plunging into the water. 

Bogora said he&#039;d never heard anything like it. "I&#039;ve been with the Seaway since 
2001, and I have never come across anything of this nature." 

Any time the Seaway has to interrupt traffic on the Welland Canal there&#039;s a 
cost to the Seaway and its customers, Bogora said. 
Fortunately, on Tuesday, the car&#039;s plunge in the water didn&#039;t halt ship traffic.
The approaching ship was far enough away from the bridge that it didn&#039;t 
have to stop when the car fell into its path. 

The Buick was pulled out of the canal with a crane during a lull between 
ships passing. The incident, which was like something out of a movie, was 
likely caught on film. Seaway officials will review its videos, as they always do 
in any incidents. "We often review tapes to review the event itself and ask 
ourselves what can we do to prevent future events of this nature," Bogora said. 
But with a system that includes sirens, traffic lights and barriers, Bogora said 
most people would agree the Seaway did everything it could. 
Phillip Boucher will appear in court Aug. 29.

Thanks to Roland for this story:
John was a salesman&#039;s delight when it came to any kind of unusual 
gimmick. His wife Marsha had long ago given up trying to get him 
to change. One day John came home with another one of his 
unusual purchases. It was a robot that John claimed was actually 
a lie detector.

It was about 5:30 that afternoon when Tommy, their 11-year-old son, 
returned home from school. Tommy was over two hours late.

"Where have you been? Why are you over two hours late getting 
home?" asked John.

"Several of us went to the library to work on an extra credit project," 
said Tommy. The robot then walked around the table and slapped 
Tommy, knocking him completely out of his chair.

"Son," said John, "this robot is a lie detector. Now tell us where 
you really were after school."

"We went to Bobby&#039;s house and watched a movie," said Tommy.

"What did you watch?" asked Marsha.

"The Ten Commandments," answered Tommy. The robot went 
around to Tommy and slapped him again, knocking him off his 
chair once more. With his lip quivering, Tommy got up from the 
floor, sat down, and said, "I am sorry I lied. We really watched 
an R-rated movie."

"I am ashamed of you, son," said John. "When I was your age, 
I never lied to my parents." The robot then walked around to 
John and delivered a whack that nearly knocked him out of 
his chair.

Marsha doubled over in laughter, almost in tears, and said, 
"Boy, did you ever ask for that one! You can&#039;t be too mad 
with Tommy. After all, he is your son!"

With that the robot immediately walked around to Marsha 
and knocked her out of her chair.

Dear Webby,
Thought this might interest you - if you haven&#039;t seen it already.

Campaign seeks to save Windows XP 
SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A San Francisco editor for a popular 
tech site says he is leading a campaign to stop Microsoft from 
discontinuing sales of Windows XP this week..... 

</i>
Dear Linda
Yes, saw that this spring.
However, the Emperor said his clothes are fine and most 
$6000 computers can run Vista with only minor tweaking. 
He also pointed out that if you buy Vista Ultimate (the version 
that won&#039;t run on computers that cost less than $4000), 
then you can get an XP CD from them for free.

If you have Vista Home, you have to buy XP on eBay from 
one of the Thousands of people who stocked up while it was 
still available, or buy an old klunker at a yard sale and use 
it&#039;s XP CD.

That boneheaded attitude boosted Linux installations by 
18% so far this year, and even Mac reports record sales
increases. 

Have FUN!
Dear Webby

Morris the matchmaker approached a single woman and told her he had
a husband for her.

"I&#039;m ashamed to bring this up," he said, "but the man wants to be 
sure you are compatible in bed. He wants, he says, a sample."

The woman was shocked. "Such a thing you ask a virtuous woman? 
Such a crude person would suggest such an immoral thing? 
He must be a barnyard animal, not a gentleman. "

The matchmaker, trying to earn a fee, Morris said, "He&#039;s a business 
man. He buys goods in the market and he sells goods. By him, it&#039;s 
not a big deal... just a sample."

She thought a minute. "He&#039;s a business man? So tell him I don&#039;t
give free samples. If he wants, I can give him 50 or 60 references."

<B>Stay Cool This Summer While Saving Energy</b>
If you use air-conditioning, set your thermostat as high as
comfortably possible in the summer. The less difference between
the indoor and outdoor temperatures, the lower your overall
cooling bill will be. Don&#039;t set your thermostat at a colder
setting at first, it will not cool your home any faster.

<hr />

A young boy of four was going into hospital to have his tonsils
removed.  He told his playmate I&#039;ll be gone for awhile I have to
have surgery.

On the day he was admitted his mother asked if the doctor
would please circumcise the boy, since he&#039;s already going to
be under anaesthesia.

The boy woke up and was very sore "down there" there for
several days.

About a week later he got to see his playmate again.  The
playmate informed him that he, too, was also going to have to
have his tonsils out.  He asked the boy to tell him about the
surgery.

The little boy replied, "All I can tell you is your tonsils ain&#039;t
where you think they are."

goes to Gregory Allen Praeger, 46, of Deland, Florida

<B> Florida man hits mom in head with sausage</b>
 
Published: July 2, 2008 
DELAND, Fla. (AP) � A man was charged with battery after he 
hit his mother in the head with a three-pound package of 
Polish sausage, police said. 

Gregory Allen Praeger, 46, was in the kitchen cooking and 
talking on the phone when officers arrived Saturday night. 
His mother told police he had been drinking and arguing 
with her, then picked up the package of sausage and hurled 
it, grazing her head. She was not badly hurt and did not 
have to go to the hospital. 

Praeger confirmed his mother&#039;s story, police said. He was 
held on $500 bond, according to jail records.

A lady goes to the doctor to see about getting a
facelift. "Well," says the doctor, "I can do the
facelift, and then you&#039;ll have to come back in six
months for a follow-up."

"Oh, no." the woman replies. "I want it all done in one
shot. I don&#039;t want to have to come back."

The doctor thinks for a second, then offers, "There is
a new procedure where we put a screw in the top of your
head. Then anytime you see wrinkles appearing, you just
give it a little turn, which pulls the skin up and they
disappear."

"That&#039;s what I want!" exclaims the lady. "Let&#039;s do
that."

Six months later the lady charges into the doctor&#039;s
office.

"How&#039;s the procedure holding up?" the doctor asks.

"Terrible!" the lady bellows. "It&#039;s the worst mistake
I&#039;ve ever made."

"What&#039;s wrong?" asks the doctor.

"Just look at these bags under my eyes!" she hollers.

"Lady," the doctor reports, "those aren&#039;t bags, those
are your boobs, and if you don&#039;t leave that screw
alone, you&#039;re going to have a beard!"

Dear Webby,
Have read and enjoyed yor advice on many computer problems. 
At the time I may read them, that is not my problem, but later, 
I might wish to have that information. I&#039;m wondering if it would be 
possible to compile a booklet containing these answers? I think 
it could be helpful to many.    Always enjoy your letter.

The Boy Scouts were out collecting bottles for a fund raising
activity.

One ambitious but nervous young man knocked on a door and
a sour-faced lady came to the door and asked, "What do you
want, Sonny?"

"D-d-do you have any beer bottles for the Boy Scouts, M-m-m-
ma&#039;am?" he asked.

"Look here, young man, do I look like the kind of lady who
would drink beer?" replied the lady.

bottles?"

the clothes she was trying on. Finally, an attendant knocked 
on her door and asked if there was a specific color or style 
she could get for her.

"I need a dress for my class reunion," the woman answered. 
"I don&#039;t care what color or style, as long as it makes me look 
twenty pounds lighter and ten years younger."

From another dressing room, I heard a woman call out, 
"Make that two!"

Thanks to Sandie for sending in this link:

<B>What are they smoking in THAT government?</b>
 
A Dutch ban on cigarette smoking in public places takes effect today, 
but people still will be able to light up in the country&#039;s cafes � 
as long as they are smoking pot. The nationwide tobacco ban is 
intended to protect workers from secondhand nicotine smoke in bars, 
cafes and restaurants, not to keep them from getting stoned.

My six-year-old grandson was playing one of his video games while
I worked in the kitchen near him.

He asked,"Grandma, what does &#039;veni, vidi, vici&#039; mean?"

I answered,"It means &#039;I came, I saw, I conquered.&#039; Why do you ask?"

He said,"It&#039;s here on my game."

A short while later I heard him say, "So that&#039;s what the ol Romans
said instead of &#039;Been there, done that, got their t-shirt&#039; ?"

Re: Small fonts on MSN
<i>
Dear Webby,
Another question for you...
I&#039;ve recently upgraded my monitor to a 22 inch Acer LCD monitor.
MSN.com is my home page for the internet and I&#039;ve set the font size
to large on the home page (view, text size, large) but it still appears small
on the MSN home page. Other pages ie google are fine.
Is there something else that I should be doing?

Thanks for the help and I keep voting on your site daily.

Dear Frank
I had a look at their site and it does indeed look like it was written
for people with little girl&#039;s eyesight, and zooms only from tiny to medium.
It probably looks OK on the old 800 x 600 Mac that they use to
write the page, but at today&#039;s resolution on current Windows
machines, their font size limit is too low.

Since all other pages display properly and only MSN malfunctions,
I would suggest contacting MSN about that.

Have FUN!
Dear Webby

 The mother of three notoriously unruly youngsters was asked whether
 or not she&#039;d have children if she had it to do over again.

 "Sure," she replied, "but definitely not THOSE three!"

<B>Overflowing Toilet</b>
Take off the back of the toilet tank and push the stopper down so
it stops allowing water into the bowl. Then reach down behind the
toilet and turn off the water valve. Find your handy plunger to
take care of the blockage. A few squirts of dish soap followed by
hot water and waiting a bit, then plunging, usually unclogs it.

A nearsighted minister glanced at the note that Mrs.  Jones had sent to
him by an usher.

The note read: "Bill Jones having gone to sea, his wife desires the
prayers of the congregation for his safety."

Failing to observe the punctuation, he startled his audience by
announcing:

"Bill Jones, having gone to see his wife, desires the prayers of the
congregation for his safety."

        Tech Support Pits</a>: Re: Not getting a subscription </b> <i><br />
        ... not getting my subscription newsletters, not just the Humor Letter, but
        others too. I can&#039;t re-sub- scribe because I am still on the list.... </i> <br />
        <br />
        Dear Friends, If you are on the list, then the subscriptions are sent out
        TOWARDS you. If you don&#039;t see them, then either you or your ISP are blocking
        them. <br />
        <br />
        Complaining to me won&#039;t fix your or your ISP&#039;s spam block. Check your spam
        control program and, if necessary, white-list the missing subscription or
        declare it as friendly. If your spam control program is OK, contact your
        ISP. <br />
        <br />
        If you are using one of those address collectors that pretend to be email
        verification programs, but ask for people to fill out all kinds of information,
        forget it! <br />
        NO newsletter send program will even click on a verification link, never
        mind filling out some silly junkmail order form. If you want a newsletter,
        it is up to YOU, to make sure that you are not blocking it.<br />
        <br />
        The Humor Letter is no exception, except that you can still read it here,
        on-line, at <a href="http://webby.com/humor">http://webby.com/humor</a>,
        even if you are blocking it in the mail. <br />
        <br />
        You can see back issues at <a href="http://webby.com/humor/blog">http://webby.com/humor/blog</a><br />
        <br />
        You might not need this info now, but keep it in mind, just in case ANY subscription
        mysteriously stops. <br />
        <br />
