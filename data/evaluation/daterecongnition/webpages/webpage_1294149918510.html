<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Talk of human rights is, currently,
nearly as ubiquitous as talk of globalization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>While globalization has been described as �the most over used and under
specified term in the international policy sciences since the end of the Cold
War�, the same could reasonably be said of �human rights�.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Human rights are a product of the immediate
aftermath of World War II, and thus they developed, in their contemporary form,
in the context of the Cold War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The
philosophical and political roots of human rights, of course, date back at
least to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and some would say even
further, to the Stoics of Ancient Greece.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Globalization, too, has unfolded mainly in the late twentieth-century
and has reached a position of prominence in the post-Cold War context; at this
juncture, and according to popular perception, the spread of market capitalism,
Western culture and modern technology fit comfortably with the death of
socialism and the �end of history�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>But
globalization too has roots that date back much earlier<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>� as early as, it has been argued, the
fourteenth century.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The purpose of this paper is to
explore the relationship between globalization and human rights, in the context
of so-called �global civil society� (GCS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>In particular, I seek to interrogate the use of the human rights
discourse by social movements,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the emerging
�anti-globalization� movement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>While
there has been much celebration of both the achievements and the potential of
global civil society in contesting globalization, there have also been
considerable doubt, scepticism and pleas for caution.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">� </span>Most of this has focused on the deficits in democratic practice
within the organizations of GCS; the degree of dependence of NGOs on financial
support from governments and other international institutions; and the
�discursive demobilization� of global social movements vis-�-vis globalization
and the resultant lack of a �strategic/normative stance�.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>While these are all crucial and often
ignored points which deserve recognition and will feature in this paper, the
central argument will focus on the extent to which the many of the
organizations of GCS � especially contemporary Northern NGOs and social
movements -- have relied on an ostensibly universal discourse of human rights
to promote a set of values that are heavily gendered and which reflect a
Western bias.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>The ethics and language
of human rights, I argue, has not been wrested from the liberal framework from
which it originated, and with which it has been so closely associated for the
last half-century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>As such, this
discourse still relies on the same basic set of values as the agents of
globalization themselves � the transnational corporations, the international
financial institutions and the powerful Western states.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>This suggests that, in relying on the
discourse of universal human rights, not only will the organizations of GCS be
unsuccessful in contesting globalization, but they may indeed be complicit in
sustaining it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The paper will explore the
processes of globalization, the nature and role of global civil society and the
historical origins and contemporary nature of the discourse of human
rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>I will argue that human rights
as they are currently understood can provide neither a practical goal nor a
discursive basis for anti-globalization movements because they represent not
universal values but a particular set of values and political ends that are
Western-centric and which reflect a Western hegemonic masculinity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>To support this claim I will explore two
developments in human rights theory and practice: first, a renewed interest in
and commitment to economic and social rights in the context of globalization,
exemplified by the recent move by Western human rights NGOs � notably, Amnesty
International -- to incorporate economic and social rights into their mandates;
and second, the on-going struggle for the recognition of women�s human
rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>I will argue that neither of
these efforts to repackage human rights have, as yet, adequately addressed the
moral, socio-economic and political challenges faced by the states and peoples
of the Third World and by women the world over.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">� </span>This is because the ethical and discursive construction that
underwrites these modified forms of human rights remains essentially unchanged.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>It will be a major contention of
this paper that there can be no single discursive or ethico-political strategy
against globalization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>I will, however,
suggest that feminist ethics may offer a fundamentally new understanding of
what it means to challenge globalization, based on two key factors:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>first, its relational ontology, and second,
its scepticism of moral universalism and ethical necessity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>On the basis of this ethics, human rights
may have a role to play, but they will no longer be able to articulate �human�
goods � such as democracy and environmental security � as �genuinely universal,
consensual aspects of a global �common good�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>I do not suggest this approach to ethics as a normative focus strictly
�for� women and peoples of the Third World; rather, it should be understood as
an approach with widespread relevance which questions the necessity of
globalization without replacing it with yet another moral and political
imperative.</p>

<h1>Globalization, Competition and the State</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>While globalization is an elusive
and heavily contested term, it is generally recognized as referring to
economic, technological and social processes which have led to a situation in
whereby �social relations are less tied to territorial frameworks�.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Economic globalization, however, is more
specific:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>it usually refers to the
processes of liberalization, deregulation and integration of the global economy
in the areas of production, exchange and finance.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Much of the literature surrounding
globalization � and especially its economic aspects � focuses on the changing
role of the state in light of these transformative processes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>While the most extreme sceptics, on one
hand, and the �hyperglobalists�, on the other, disagree on this question, there
seems to be a broad underlying continuity among the majority of analysts:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>specifically, while state and interstate
relations persist at the core of governance arrangements, there is nonetheless
a notable change in the character of the state: �its capacities; its
constituencies; its policy-making processes; its policy contents; and so on�.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>In one of the most compelling
arguments regarding the state and globalization, Phil Cerny has argued that the
main task or function of the contemporary state is the promotion of economic
activities, both at home or abroad, which make firms and sectors located within
the territory of the state competitive in international markets.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>Cerny calls this the �competition state�,
thus differentiating it from the �strategic� or �developmental� state of the
1980s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Then, states were, as they have
always been to some extent, promoters of market forces; today, by contrast,
states are transforming themselves into more and more market-oriented and
market-based organizations in the search for competitiveness in an increasingly
economically interpenetrated world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The
effects of this are, potentially, immense:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">�</span>� we may be witnessing the transmutation of the state from a civil
association into a more limited form of enterprise association, or perhaps some
more complex combination of the two, operating within a wider market and
institutional environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>This is not
merely a change in degree, but a change in kind.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">� </span>Uneven globalization is thus leading to the emergence of a
still-embryonic �residual state�, which may be vulnerable to crises of
legitimacy.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></span></span></a> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>This is not to suggest, however,
that the state has become redundant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">��
</span>In spite of the globalization of economic structures, the national state
retains great political, social and psychological significance for its
citizens, as well as some vital political and economic functions at both
domestic and international levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>However, while the state retains a crucial structural role in a
globalizing world, its �holistic and overarching character has been deeply
compromised�.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9' href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[9]<![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The forces and processes of
economic globalization that are pushing the state to transform � to �marketize�
� are powerful ones indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>They have
been made all the more powerful insofar as they have been presented and widely
accepted not as a policy option or ideological/economic/ethical position, but
as �common sense�:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>in a world of
deregulated exchange rates and the absence of controls on the movement of
capital, financial stabilization and economic liberalization have been
presented as essential to sustain a sound currency, international banking, a
beneficial balance of international and international trade, and the foreign
investment that is essential to growth.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn10'
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[10]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>This �common sense� has become known as the
�Washington consensus�, and was enforced during the 1980s and 1990s by the
World Bank and the IMF, who compel states to observe the �commonsensical
conditions� that these institutions put upon their lending.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Furthermore, the WTO has, more recently,
made it difficult for states not to lose if they refuse to accept the
organization�s rules on international trade.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11'
href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[11]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Thus, while all states are affected by
globalization, weaker states, which lack the conditions currently present in
the United States, have slim prospects for economic � not to mention social and
political -- success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Recently, it has been argued that
this �Washington Consensus� has given way, in the last five years or so, to a
�Post Washington Consensus�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The
principle element of this new consensus is the development of an understanding
amongst the international institutional policy community of the need for a
stronger �governance dimension� to the international economic order.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn12' href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[12]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>This change has been brought about by, among
other things, the protests against globalization and the general recognition
that global liberalization brings with it increased inequality.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>However, as Richard Higgott points out, this
shift represents only the minimum response from the international policy
community to manage the increasing hostility towards the liberalization and
deregulation processes that have been at the heart of globalization.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Indeed, what characterizes the PWC,
according to Higgott, is its �lack of an understanding of politics and a wider
commitment to the creation of a global ethic of poverty alleviation via a
commitment to redistribution�.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13' href="#_ftn13"
name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[13]<![endif]></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Thus, despite the shift towards
�global governance�, it can by no means be said that we are moving towards a
kind of �global politicization�.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn14' href="#_ftn14"
name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[14]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Descriptions of contemporary global
governance range from the ideational and ethereal � �the cloud of ideological
influences that has fostered the realignment of elite thinking to the needs of
the world market� � to the concrete and material � the powerful public
institutions such as the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank, and the UN.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn15' href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[15]<![endif]></span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>While some regard contemporary global
governance as a positive step forward in the regulation of global capitalism,
it has been pointed out that many of these institutions remain �creatures of
the most powerful of their state members�; thus, there is concern that the
institutions of contemporary global governance remain driven by the logic of
capitalist growth and are themselves undermining democracy and are contributing
to the growing gap between rich and poor.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16'
href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Thus, while the very existence of a
system of global governance is, in part, a response to anti-globalization
pressure and sentiment, there can be little doubt that the Post Washington
Consensus will be as much the target of contestation as its predecessor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>To quote Higgott once more:</p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>The PWC is no less universalizing and attempts to be no
less homogenizing, that the WC itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Global policy debates, in this way, remain reliant on a set of
generalizable, but essentially Western, liberal principles and policy
prescriptions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>�these prescriptions
still demonstrate a penchant for universalizing notions of a
�one-size-fits-all� convergence on issues of policy reform under conditions of
globalization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Such prescriptions may
well be resisted in the developing world as but a new form of Western hegemony.<a

demanded greater recognition of economic and social rights.<span

War, largely reflective of ideological differences, it also, to some extent,

social and cultural rights, there is no doubt that some progress in the
recognition of the latter has been made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�

of nonintervention in the private sphere, which has grown up in human rights

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>The key point here is worth
restating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>It must be recognized that
to call for �women�s human rights� is to challenge and undermine the foundation
of human rights � the notion of �humanity as such�.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">� </span>It is, therefore, to undermine their claim to �ethical necessity�
� which is the basis of their claim to be universal, absolute, inalienable
�trump cards�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>It could be argued that,
once this is undermined, the moral and political force of rights is lost.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Hutchings, however, argues that their force
becomes radically rethought;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>rights
become, as she states above, strategic weapons in the construction of a form of
ethical life which is not absolutely and universally good, but which,
hopefully, is preferable at least for many, if not all women, at a particular
moment in time and space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>I would
argue, however, that thus understood, one is no longer working with a concept
of rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>While rights may still exist,
the moral ideas which are actually being used to benefit the lives of women are
not rights � rather, they are a diverse set of ethical concepts and strategies
which are contextual and contingent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Clearly, the work that has been
done by academics and activists to expand and reconstruct international human
rights to include the specific vulnerabilities and concerns of women has been,
and continues to be, extremely valuable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>That said, when anti-globalization activists frame their challenge using
the unexamined discourse of rights, they draw on a totalizing ethical discourse
which, so constructed, fails to address the needs of most women.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>If rights are to be used successfully at
all, the entire foundation of them must be overturned.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>This may or may not be possible, given the
entrenchment of universal, Western notions of human right in the international
context today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>In the context of the
challenge to globalization, it may be that the totalizing discourse of rights
must give way not to another universal language, but to a wide variety of norms
and ethical practices that can speak to women and to non-Westerners, especially
in the �developing� world.</p>

<h1>Non-totalizing ethics and globalization </h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%'>The feminist understanding of
human rights described above provides just one example of how our understanding
of �the ethical� is transformed from the position of feminist ethics.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Feminist ethics represents a relatively new
intervention into the fields of moral and political philosophy, normative
international relations theory, and now, public policy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Certainly, there have been many
controversies surrounding the nature and epistemological grounding of feminist
ethics and its ability to translate successfully into �public� life.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>That said, in its short life-span, feminist
understandings of morality as contextual and concrete relations of care � understood
as attentiveness and responsiveness to the needs of others � has had a
significant impact on moral theory and is beginning to enter the arena of
policy-making.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%'>Kimberly Hutchings provides a
conceptualization of feminist ethics which contrasts radically with traditional
human rights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>She argues that feminist
ethics must avoid any attempt to advocate values associated with the private
sphere as in some way �better� than the values of rights or justice.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The reason for this is not associated with
familiar arguments about stereotyping and essentializing the �feminine�;
rather, it is based on an epistemological argument � in particular, a desire to
avoid the kind of totalizing, prescriptive ethical arguments which feminists
were engaged in criticizing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Thus, for
feminist ethics, she argues in favour of the more modest claim that the �moral
ontology of relations of recognition and responsibility which is identified
within the private sphere is the key to understanding �moral substance� as
such�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Thus, a feminist approach to
ethics is fundamentally about ontology � what exists � and the related claim
that this ontology provides both a background and a set of conceptual and
analytical tools for making sense of ethics, even in the global context.<a

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%'>Furthermore, Hutchings argues
that power, especially gendered relations of power, is a crucial facet of this
�reality� in which these relations and practices of care are embedded. In
particular, she claims that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Feminist ethicists find ethical
significance in those gendered aspects of international ethical reality which,
in being presented as necessary, are either not �seen� at all or are seen as
unquestionable.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn63' href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63"

<p class=MsoHeader style='text-align:justify;line-height:200%;tab-stops:.5in'>The
prescriptions following from this view of feminist ethics will vary depending
on context; theorists must, she argues, �take responsibility for articulating
the conditions within which any prescriptions made are meaningful and therefore
the kind of world they imply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�� </span>Indeed,
there is only one prescription that would be common to the practice of feminist
ethics<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>always be skeptical of any kind of moral essentialism or claims to
ethical necessity.�</i><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn64' href="#_ftn64"

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Thus, the task of ethical inquiry
and critique has two parts to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>First, it involves recognizing the ubiquity of moral practices which do
not conform to the universalist,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>rights-based model of �justice ethics�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Second, and related to this, it involves recognizing that power
relations � particularly related to gender, but also to race, religion and
ethnicity � are the context in which all types of international social
relations are embedded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>With regard to
the first part, it may be important to note that, in an era of globalization,
while the welfare state is experiencing a profound crisis, care remains a hidden
yet ever-present part of people�s everyday lives, in both �developed� and
�developing� countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Whereas the
modern welfare state was understood in terms of a single model � where a
central administration collected taxes for the redistribution of wealth and
social goods � care can be and is understood and practiced in a variety of
different ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>While much time and
energy has been (usefully) expended by feminist theorists in demonstrating that
care is not simply a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>private</i> ethics,
that is not to say that it is not, nor cannot be, private.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Care � as both a moral response and a
practice � occurs daily among family members, friends and loved ones.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>It is also, as it has been for years, an
integral part of remaining welfare functions in many nation-states; health care
workers, social workers, child caregivers, hospice workers use public funds to
administer care to those who are � as we all are at one time in our lives �
needy and vulnerable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Care is also, and
perhaps increasingly so as a result of globalization and marketization, a
private function � where private is understood in the economic, rather than the
familial and personal sense of the word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Care occurs at all levels � the family and private spheres, and the
public spheres at the local, national and global levels.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Moreover, it occurs within social relations
of all types � personal relations, marketized relations, and state-level
relations, either within or among states.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Care is an ethic and a practice
which can help to create bonds among individuals and groups within and across
borders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>That said, however, care
cannot simply provide an alternative to globalization or to the state.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The feminist language of �care� is not a
universalist prescription for global ethics; moreover, social bonds cannot
simply be transferred to the global level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>In spite of proclamations of global village, global civil society, and
even the �global state�, social bonds among �citizens of the world� do not
exist in any obvious way � especially not as a direct result of globalization.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>However, recognizing the ubiquity and
diversity of caring <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>practices </i>can
provide us with a moral and discursive framework for imaging possible futures
that challenge the logic of globalization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>Importantly, however, this is not based on the primacy of �care� as a
universal value, but simply a recognition that caring practices exist
everywhere.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn65' href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65"

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>This paper has sought to examine
the discursive and ethical construction of rights as a basis for the challenge
to globalization by �global civil society�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>In particular, I have argued, along with many feminist and post-colonial
theorists, that �human rights� is a Western-centric and gendered concept with
pretensions to universality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>As such,
it fits comfortably, at the present stage, with the general ideology and goals
not only of the advocates of neo-liberal globalization, but also of �global
civil society�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Advocates of global
civil society as a �political project� readily admit that it is driven by
values which originated in the West (but which are now purportedly �global�) is
comprised largely of Western groups and individuals.<a style='mso-footnote-id:

style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>They admit that �large parts of Africa or
Latin America are virtually excluded from globalised activities�, and that
those who support civic internationalist values are �the cosmopolitan young
people� who work in international organizations or the media, or who join
Greenpeace or Amnesty International, or who offer �voluntary contributions� to
�cosmopolitan causes�.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>The �courageous
territorially tied people� who work in local institutions are said to be
�equally important�, yet there is a strong suggestion that these people remain
�behind�, still locked in the �nationalist and exclusivist� ideologies of
yesteryear, and as yet insufficiently tuned in to the dynamics of transnational
values and activism.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn67' href="#_ftn67"

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Human rights is the obvious discursive
framework for this �political project�, which is modernist, Western-centric,
and gendered in its approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>It is,
paradoxically, also the logical discursive framework for the neo-liberals and
indeed all advocates of greater economic liberalization and globalization, who
seek �open�, stable political societies as a basis for open markets.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Critics of this comparison would argue, of
course, that neo-liberals remain focused on a narrow definition of rights which
limits them to civil and political rights; global civil society, and in
particular the anti-globalization movement, it could be argued, reject this
narrow definition in favour of a broader definition of rights which encompasses
economic, social and cultural rights as well as �women�s human rights�.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>I have argued, however, that the
ethical and discursive construction of rights is not sufficiently elastic to
accommodate these moves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Rights remains
a concept which is tied to the individual and which articulates his freedoms
from intervention, primarily from the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">�
</span>As such it is a skeleton moral concept, not in the sense that what it
articulates is basic or �fundamental�, but in the sense that it is about the
procedure that must be followed for individuals to pursue and enjoy freely
their own conception of the good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>It
lacks the ability to �flesh out�, or put features on that skeleton.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Economic and social<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>welfare is about that flesh and those
features � human goods rather than human rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">�� </span>Fundamentally different moral and discursive concepts to
elucidate the moral imperatives surrounding physical and spiritual nourishment,
health care, education and cultural expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>Moreover, the notion of human
rights is based on a moral foundation of universality, which cannot accompany
the feminist requirement of the recognition of difference.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Human rights cannot escape the requirement
of universality; to do so would be to undermine the concept entirely.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Indeed, the voices have global civil society
are uninterested in doing this; on the contrary, they embrace universality in
the form of �transnational� or �cosmopolitan� values.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">� </span>But it is far from evident that the values of democracy, human
rights and environmental stability � articulated as they are by Western NGOs �
are in any sense universal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>In no way is this argument meant to
degrade or disparage the moral and political progress that has been achieved
through the discursive and legal power of human rights; nor is it to overlook
the tremendous role played by social movements and non-governmental
organizations � both in the West and, more quietly, at the grassroots,
community-based level in the South and East � in combating exclusion and
hierarchy in the effort to achieve more just and equitable societies.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>Rather, my quarrel is with the unreflective
acceptance of the �global� in global civil society, and the assumption that
human rights can provide a discursive, ethical and political strategy for
combating globalization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">� </span>In an era when
there is a proliferation of new kinds or rights and new rights holders, and an
increasingly widespread use of the discourse, we must explore the possibilities
of alternative discursive and ethical categories to offer real challenges to
globalization.</p>
