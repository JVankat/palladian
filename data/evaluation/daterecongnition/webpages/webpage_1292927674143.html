			Mirae Asset, South Korea's No. 1 mutual fund company, will launch major operations in Brazil and Dubai this year, in a rare example of a home-grown Asia asset manager expanding outside the region.
<br />
<br />The USD74 billion fund firm also plans to open offices in New York and Tokyo, with an eye to managing money in both markets by the end of next year, said Managing Director Mi Seob Kim, one of its top international executives.
<br />
<br />The firm expects to raise USD500 million from the Dubai office in its first year of operation, as it builds on its client base of non-resident Indians there to serve other investors in the Gulf region, he said.
<br />
<br />In Brazil, where it is seeking regulatory approvals and plans to put distribution and marketing teams in place by year end, Mirae Asset hopes to replicate the success of its recent Indian expansion, which has already raised about USD500 million, he added.
<br />
<br />"Among the emerging markets, Brazil is one of the most promising ... recently the Brazilian government allowed local investors to invest in overseas assets, so the Brazil market has tremendous potential," he told Reuters in an interview at the firm's Hong Kong office.
<br />
<br />"The plan is to provide the local investors with our emerging market investment products. Also, we are planning to launch local investment product."
<br />
<br />Emerging market experience
<br />
<br />Founded in 1997 near the depths of the Asian financial crisis, closely held Mirae Asset became an industry leader as the strong performance of its funds attracted huge inflows from South Korean retail investors.
<br />
<br />Unlike many Asian peers, the company's ambitions extend beyond its home market, as it opened offices in centres like Hong Kong, Singapore and London to manage funds raised from South Korean investors.
<br />
<br />But the strategy was stepped up a notch this year when Mirae Asset launched funds targeting India's retail investors. This sparked interest from Indians living in the Gulf, which in turn encouraged plans to open the Dubai office in the third quarter.
<br />
<br />"Initially we are planning to set up just a marketing and sales office in Dubai. As the business grows we'll expand these marketing and sales activities into a full fledged operation," the executive said, adding would eventually include managing money invested in the region.
<br />
<br />In a bid to raise more assets outside South Korea, the Seoul-based firm is readying a line of nine funds domiciled in Europe using the region's open-ended SICAV legal structure. This would allow them to be sold in a range of markets, including some in Asia.
<br />
<br />This will bring Mirae Asset into closer competition with global mutual fund giants like Deutsche Bank's DWS arm, BlackRock Inc, Franklin Resources Inc and closely held Fidelity.
<br />
<br />Hong Kong-based Kim said Mirae Asset already has experience in competing with global managers in its home market and can point to its expertise managing money in emerging markets.
<br />
<br />"Going forward we have a strong belief that these U.S. and European investors, they're transferring their assets from the developed markets to these developing, emerging markets. So they are looking at good investment opportunities," he said.
