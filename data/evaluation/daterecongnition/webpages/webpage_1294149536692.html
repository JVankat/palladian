<p><b><a name="I"></a>I. Improvised Hedgehog Defenses</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>From the very first days of the campaign, the vastness 
  of European Russia and the peculiarities of Russian warfare led to the repeated 
  isolation of individual units and combat teams. All�around defenses and security 
  measures were the only possible remedy. Far from being stressed, these defense 
  tactics were frequently not even mentioned in the field service regulations. 
  The field forces improvised them and designated them very appropriately as &quot;hedgehog 
  defenses.&quot; As time went on these tactics were applied more and more frequently 
  and adopted by larger units. Their use was not confined to defense. During offensive 
  actions advance detachments had to build hedgehog defenses as protection against 
  enemy surprise attacks by night. For instance, during their advance through 
  a swampy forest region in Lithuania where strong, dispersed enemy forces were 
  reassembling, combat teams of 6th Panzer Division formed the first hedgehog 
  positions during the initial week of the Russian campaign. Several hay barns 
  in a major clearing were selected as the location for the divisional command 
  post. Covered by thick underbrush, the tanks were placed in a wide circle around 
  the barns with their guns ready to fire at the edge of the woods. In front of 
  the tanks was an outer ring of infantry in foxholes and ditches and behind embankments 
  which enabled the tanks to fire over their heads. Security patrols and outposts 
  formed an outer cordon. The Russians recognized the strength of these protective 
  measures and did not dare carry out the surprise attack they had planned. They 
  resigned themselves to harassing the hedgehog area with tank and machine gun 
  fire and a few rounds of artillery shells.</p>
<p >The hedgehog defense provided the troops with security 
  and rest and thus passed its first major test. Before long these precautions 
  became a routine security and defense measure for armored spearheads. The first 
  large-scale employment of this measure occurred during the thrust toward 
  Vyazma in October 1941 when an entire panzer division with 260 tanks spent the 
  first night of the attack in an elaborate system of hedgehog positions in the 
  woods. (Map 1) Forming the spearhead of a powerful wedge, the division had penetrated 
  the enemy lines to a depth of twenty miles. In its rear and on its flanks de-</p>
<p  align="center"><b>22 </b></p>
<hr>
<p >feated enemy divisions were withdrawing under cover of darkness. A retreating 
  enemy corps staff sought refuge in a small isolated village in the forest which 
  was occupied by the German divisional staff. Enemy troop units were around the 
  entire system of tank hedgehogs. As long as the German tanks were on their own, 
  the intermittent firing of flares and machine guns indicated their great uneasiness. 
  This changed with the arrival of the armored infantry which followed the tanks. 
  When the divisional artillery and engineers arrived and were also integrated 
  into the hedgehog defense system, a restful night was had by all. Early next 
  morning the Russians departed very quietly because they were unable to find 
  any rest in the immediate vicinity of the German division.</p>
<p><b><a name="II"></a>II. Defensive Improvisations in Extreme Cold</b></p>
<p >During the last days of 1941, the 6th Panzer Division was outmaneuvered by 
  superior Russian forces and dislodged from a chain of villages which surrounded 
  a large forest region. The division was faced with two alternatives: It could 
  either withdraw a certain distance to another group of communities and be enveloped 
  and split up, or it could establish defense positions in front of or between 
  these indefensible villages in a temperature of -49� F. without adequate shelter 
  which would mean certain death from exposure. During the engagements of the 
  last few days, most of which had of necessity taken place in open terrain, the 
  daily casualties from frostbite had increased at an alarming rate. By 3 January 
  1942 the number of moderate and severe frost bite casualties had risen to 800 
  per day. At that rate the division would soon have ceased to exist. The immediate 
  construction of shelters and bunkers, with whatever heating facilities could 
  be installed, was mandatory. But these defensive positions could not be built 
  because only one corps and two divisional engineer battalions with 40 to 60 
  men each and very little equipment were available. On the other hand a large 
  quantity of explosives had recently arrived at division. In view of the critical 
  situation, the engineer battalion commanders were ordered to disregard the frost 
  and to blast enough craters into the solidly frozen ground along the tentative 
  defense line to provide shelter for all combat units including the reserves. 
  These craters were to be echeloned in width and depth and were to hold three 
  to five men each. The engineers were also to mine certain areas and build tank 
  obstacles in three places. The reserves and service troops were ordered to pack 
  down paths be-</p>
<p align="center" ><b>23</b></p>
<hr>

<p >tween the craters and to the rear. They were to 
  use readily available lumber to cover the craters.</p>
<p >The blasting along the entire line started early next morning. The noise of 
  the 10,000-pound explosive charges somehow gave the impression of a heavy barrage. 
  Fountains of earth rose all around and dense smoke filled the air. The enemy 
  watched with surprise, could not understand what was happening, and remained 
  quiet. The blasting was over by noon and by nightfall the craters were covered 
  and occupied by the combat elements. Soon afterward smoke rose from the craters 
  where the crews kept warm at open fires. The craters formed an uninterrupted 
  line of positions in front of which outposts<b> </b>were established. A maze 
  of abatis lay in front of these, guns were emplaced along the thoroughfares 
  behind the tank obstacles, and the entire front line was ready for defense within 
  twelve hours after the first detonation. This position withstood all enemy attacks 
  and was not abandoned until ten days later, in milder weather, when the adjacent 
  units on both wings were forced to withdraw after enemy tanks had penetrated 
  their lines.</p>
<p >The engineers who prepared the positions in the 
  fiercest cold and suffered 40 percent frostbite casualties saved the combat 
  units and restored the situation by their sacrifice. The very next day the casualties 
  from frostbite dropped from 800 to 4 cases and thus practically ceased.</p>
<p >This improvisation was introduced at a time when 6th Panzer Division had lost 
  all its tanks during the preceding withdrawal. Before blasting the positions, 
  fighting had centered upon the possession of villages which alone could offer 
  shelter from the extreme cold. Groups of villages had formed natural phase lines 
  for both the attacker and the defender who had been forced to ignore all other 
  tactical considerations. Whenever the Russians failed to capture a village by 
  day, they withdrew to the last friendly village for the night. Not even the 
  best-equipped Siberian troops attempted to continue an attack on a village after 
  dusk. Blasting positions in open terrain was therefore an innovation that served 
  the double purpose of stabilizing the front and maintaining the combat efficiency 
  of the remnants of the division.</p>
<p >On another occasion the blasting of ice proved much less effective. In order 
  to prevent the enemy from making an enveloping thrust across Lake Pskov on the 
  Russian-Estonian border during the winter of 1943-44, Army Group North blasted 
  a ten-foot-wide, several-mile-long canal into the ice north of the isle of Salita. 
  At that time the ice was so thick that it could carry medium guns and prime 
  movers. But here, as in other</p>
<p align="center" ><b>24 </b></p>
<hr>
<p >instances, it became apparent that the blasting of ice created no permanent 
  obstacle because the water froze immediately in the extreme cold and shortly 
  afterward the ice was again capable of carrying heavy loads. In extremely low 
  temperatures all attempts to stop enemy advances by blasting frozen bodies of 
  water were doomed to fail.</p>
<p >Almost a year later, toward the end of 1944, the Germans devised another improvisation 
  to prevent the Russians from crossing a frozen body of water. By late autumn 
  the Russians had driven a wedge into the German front near Memel [Ed: now Klaipeda] 
  and had reached the Kurisches Haff. (Map 4) The Germans intended to prevent 
  the landing of enemy forces on the west side of the Haff. A large-scale landing 
  was not expected because the prerequisites for such an undertaking did not exist, 
  but it seemed quite likely that the enemy would attempt to land sabotage or 
  raiding parties, spies, agents, or commandos along the coast under cover of 
  darkness. The coastal defenses composed of service units, volunteer organizations, 
  and Volkssturm [Ed: Peoples' militia assembled during the last years of the 
  war] supported by weak reserve elements from Koenigsberg [Ed: now Kaliningrad] 
  were thought to be sufficient to thwart any such operation.</p>
<p >It was a known fact that the Haff froze over in winter and that the ice cover 
  would carry men and vehicles. This might encourage enemy attempts to envelope 
  the exposed German wing, cut off the only supply route to Memel, or undertake 
  some other major operation. For that reason plans were drawn up to block the 
  Kurisches Haff in its entire width of ten miles.</p>
<p >In the late fall of 1944 a number of wooden bunkers with heating facilities 
  were constructed for this purpose. They were approximately five feet high and 
  could hold a crew of three to five men and their weapons. The bunkers were placed 
  on rafts with sled runners in order to give them mobility on ice and simultaneously 
  to protect them from sinking into the water in case the ice suddenly broke. 
  This possibility had to be taken into account because of the sudden changes 
  in temperature which occur in this area. By the end of December 1944 the first 
  groups of bunkers were moved onto the freezing Haff, the edges of which were 
  by then sufficiently strong to carry them. The bunker positions were spread 
  over the ice as the freezing process progressed. Approximately 150 bunkers were 
  laid out in two parallel lines in checkerboard formation, giving each other 
  fire support. The bunkers were reinforced with blocks of ice on the outside 
  and camouflaged with snow. A continuous line of en-</p>
<p align="center" ><b>25</b></p>
<hr>

<p >tanglements with alarm signals was to prevent the enemy from infiltrating 
  between the bunkers. Reserves were held in readiness behind both lines of bunkers. 
  Ice boats and motor sleighs needed by the reserves to give them mobility did 
  not arrive in time and the plans for organizing a combined ice-boat and motor-sleigh 
  brigade had to be abandoned. Artillery support was provided from both shores.</p>
<p >Since the Russians lacked fast means of transportation on ice, they could 
  only have advanced on foot over the long distances of the Haff. This was probably 
  the reason why they failed to attack during the winter and this improvised position 
  was therefore never put to the test.</p>
<p><b><a name="III"></a>III. A Moving Pocket Regains the German Lines</b></p>
<p >In some instances German divisions were left behind the Russian advance and 
  were forced to fight their way back to the west. For example during the large-scale 
  Russian offensive in the winter of 1942, the 320th Infantry Division, which 
  had held a sector on the Don front with two Italian divisions at its sides, 
  suddenly found itself behind the enemy lines because of the rapid disintegration 
  of the allied units. The division commander decided to fight his way back to 
  the German lines. On the way all the divisional motor vehicles ran out of gasoline 
  and had to be destroyed. The horse-drawn batteries and trains also lost a great 
  number of horses in battle and from exhaustion. Altogether, the fighting power 
  and mobility of the division was greatly impaired. If it was not to resign itself 
  to its fate, it had to resort to improvisations. What was needed either had 
  to be wrested from the enemy or taken from the land. In this manner the division 
  procured hundreds of small draft horses for the light vehicles. The medium artillery 
  was drawn by oxen. Cows and oxen were used as draft animals for the transportation 
  of radio and signal equipment. Even the division commander decided to use such 
  a team as a sure means of transportation. The loss of many weapons such as machine 
  guns, anti�tank guns, and artillery pieces could only be offset by weapons captured 
  from weak enemy detachments on occasional raids. The ammunition needed for the 
  use of captured weapons was also taken from the enemy and the same methods were 
  applied in obtaining rations. Small radio sets and other sensitive equipment 
  had to be carried on litters. Infantrymen mounted on <i>Panje</i> horses were 
  charged with reconnaissance and security. The difficult retreat of the division 
  took several weeks and was an uninterrupted series of marches, combat actions, 
  and improvisa-</p>
<p align="center" ><b>26</b></p>
<hr>
<p >tions. As the division approached Kharkov, it suddenly made radio contact 
  and asked the German units in the city for assistance in its attempt to break 
  through to the German lines. A strong armored thrust from inside the city was 
  coordinated with a simultaneous attack by the division. The enemy lines were 
  pierced at the point designated by the division and it was able to rejoin the 
  German lines. Its appearance hardly resembled that of a German unit. A strange 
  conglomeration of weapons, equipment, vehicles, and litters, small and large 
  shaggy horses, oxen and cows, accompanied by soldiers in a variety of winter 
  clothing created the impression of a traveling circus on parade. And yet it 
  was a battle-tested unit with excellent morale that had courageously fought 
  its way through enemy territory, had returned to its own lines, and was to be 
  considered a precious addition to the corps strength. By the following day the 
  division once again stood shoulder to shoulder with the other corps units and 
  held a sector facing east. Its strong will to survive and skillful improvisations 
  enabled the division to regain its freedom.</p>
<p><b><a name="IV"></a>IV. Zone Defense Tactics</b></p>
<p >During the last years of the war, Russian break-throughs were accomplished 
  by the same methods that had been employed so successfully by the same enemy 
  in World War I. These methods had little in common with customary tactical doctrines 
  but were based on great superiority of manpower and materiel. After weeks of 
  logistical build-up and moving up the enormous quantities of ammunition needed, 
  the German front was breached after several hours of concentrated fire. This 
  was followed by the break-through of massed infantry forces and deep thrusts 
  of armored units in order to gain freedom of maneuver. The system was absolutely 
  foolproof so long as the opponent did not interfere with the sequence of events. 
  An essential prerequisite was that the defender would rigidly hold that sector 
  of the front, which was to be attacked, until he received the deadly blow. In 
  the East the Germans complied with this prerequisite since their forces had 
  strict orders not to relinquish one inch of ground voluntarily. These defense 
  tactics were enforced almost without exception until the end of the war. Being 
  aware of the army's numerical inferiority and its loss of combat efficiency 
  caused by heavy casualties, Hitler perhaps doubted its capability of conducting 
  a flexible active defense and therefore ordered all army units to cling rigidly 
  to prepared positions. But such tactics could never prevent an enemy break-through, 
  let</p>
<p align="center" ><b>27</b></p>
<hr>

<p class=MsoBodyText>alone lead to victory. Despite the fact that Russian casualties 
  were relatively heavier than those suffered by the Germans and the fighting 
  qualities of the Russian soldiers vastly inferior to those of their opponents, 
  the always-present crucial problem was to make up for the Russian superiority 
  in men and materiel. Aside from their greater fighting capabilities the Germans 
  had no other means of offsetting their inferiority than by employing more flexible 
  and superior tactics. If the military leaders lost their faith in the superiority 
  of the German armed forces in these two fields, or if shortages of materiel 
  became so acute that these advantages could not be exploited, then a favorable 
  out�come of this war was no more to be expected than in World War I. It was 
  the responsibility of the Supreme Commander, Adolf Hitler, to recognize this 
  fact and draw the necessary conclusions. Until that time it was the duty of 
  the commanders in the field to do their utmost to prevent a collapse of the 
  front lines. The greatest imminent threats to the fighting front were the Russian 
  massed attacks with subsequent break-throughs. Since adequate reserves for successful 
  defense were rarely available, it became all the more necessary to prevent the 
  annihilation of the front-line units by Russian fire concentrations, bombing 
  attacks, and massed armored thrusts in order to preserve their combat efficiency.</p>
<p >An improvisation devised for this purpose was the zone defense tactics introduced 
  toward the end of the war. It was derived from an analysis of the reasons for 
  the success of most enemy break-throughs. The principal factors to be considered 
  were the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>a.</i>�� The annihilation of front-line troops by mass concentration on 
    points along the main line of resistance;</p>
  <p><i>b.</i>�� The neutralization or destruction of the German artillery by 
    heavy counterbattery fire and continuous air attacks;</p>
  <p><i>c.</i>�� The elimination of command staffs by air attacks and surprise 
    fire on command posts up to army level;</p>
  <p><i>d.</i>�� The harassing of reserves by artillery fire and air attacks on 
    their assembly areas;</p>
  <p><i>e.</i>�� The disruption of the routes of communication to the front which 
    delayed movements of reserves and cut off supply;</p>
  <p><i>f.</i>�� The massed armored thrusts in depth which enabled the Russians 
    to obtain freedom of maneuver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p >For obvious reasons the task of the defender was to neutralize these enemy 
  tactics or at least to reduce them to tolerable proportions. One of the panzer 
  armies in the eastern theater de-</p>
<p align="center" ><b>28 </b></p>
<hr>
<p >vised the following defense measures and employed them successfully:</p>
<p ><i>a</i>.�� There were two ways of preventing the annihilation of the frontline 
  troops: either by constructing bombproof and shellproof positions or by withdrawing 
  the forward units in time to evade the devastating barrages. Since the construction 
  of shellproof positions required an expenditure of time and materials beyond 
  the German capabilities, the adoption of evasive tactics was the only solution.� 
  Such evasive tactics had already been employed during the last stage of World 
  War I. The forward positions were evacuated shortly before an imminent attack 
  and the defending troops moved far enough to the rear into a new and even stronger 
  line to force the enemy to regroup his forces, always a time-consuming maneuver. 
  The difficulties encountered by the enemy before he was able to resume the attack 
  were to be enhanced by demolitions in the intermediate terrain. These evasive 
  tactics were tried out in 1918 in the West when the German combat forces withdrew 
  to the Hindenburg Position and in the South on the Italian front along the Piave 
  River. The loss of some ground which was involved in the application of these 
  tactics was a well-considered sacrifice. But to achieve a permanent gain was 
  possible only if the new positions could be held without fail. Another method 
  of evading fire concentrations and a subsequent break-through was the adoption 
  of elastic defense tactics in a deeply echeloned system of machine gun strong 
  points which, however, often lacked the necessary resiliency to stop a major 
  enemy attack.</p>
<p >A method frequently applied by the Germans as another form of evasion can 
  best be compared with saber-fencing tactics. A cut is warded off by sudden retirement 
  with appropriate guard, followed by an immediate counterthrust which will permit 
  the fencer to regain his former position. Like the fencer, the forces holding 
  the threatened sector of the front executed a surprise withdrawal at the last 
  moment. They moved far enough to the rear so that the blow would miss them, 
  the pursuing enemy could be repelled, and the initial position could be regained 
  by a counterthrust. In order to satisfy these requirements, the terrain in which 
  the pursuing enemy was to be intercepted had to be well chosen and systematically 
  prepared in order that the withdrawing forces could resume the defense within 
  a few</p>
<p align="center" ><b>29</b></p>
<hr>

<p >hours<b>. </b>It was therefore neither possible nor essential to withdraw 
  the front-line units so far to the rear that they were out of reach of enemy 
  guns. Past experience indicated that the enemy fired his concentrations only 
  on the main line of resistance and on strong points in the zone of resistance. 
  For this reason it was absolutely necessary to evacuate this zone. Depending 
  on the terrain and local fortifications, it was usually quite sufficient to 
  withdraw the most forward troops 900 to 2,200 yards. Here was the forward edge 
  of the battle position, a well-camouflaged organized system of defense that 
  took advantage of all favorable terrain features. Numerous strong points and 
  sizable local reserves were distributed throughout the position which extended 
  back to the artillery emplacements and even beyond. In a camouflaged area behind 
  the artillery were the general reserves of corps and army. By following this 
  procedure, targets were so well dispersed that fire from as many as a thousand 
  guns directed at so large an area could cause only local damage but could never 
  wipe out entire units.</p>
<p ><i>b</i>.�� If the German artillery was to avoid neutralization and escape 
  destruction it had to switch to alternate emplacements in the battle position 
  at the decisive moment. In addition the artillery also had to use alternate 
  observation posts. These alternate positions had to be prepared well in advance, 
  provided with ammunition, and equipped with a smoothly functioning wire and 
  radio communication system. Additional battery positions and. observation posts 
  had to be reconnoitered and organized in depth so that they would be ready for 
  immediate occupancy and utilization in case of emergency. This was to guarantee 
  continuous support for the infantry even in the event of a reverse since only 
  the flexible employment of artillery units which were always intact and ready 
  to strike promised a successful defense. Furthermore, each battery had to establish 
  two or three additional alternate positions and one or two dummy positions and 
  had to fire from them with at least one registration gun in order to determine 
  firing data for every emplacement. Altogether between five and eight positions 
  had to be prepared by each battery. The Russian build-up allowed sufficient 
  time for such extensive preliminary work and the Germans could therefore devote 
  several weeks to these preparations.</p>
<p align="center" ><b>30�</b></p>
<hr>
<div0>
<p ><i>c.</i>�� All necessary precautions had to be taken to protect the command 
  staffs and their communication system from destruction by artillery preparations 
  and the ensuing general attack. For that reason no command staff from battalion 
  up to army was permitted to stay at the command post it occupied before the 
  start of the enemy attack. Each staff had to prepare a well-camouflaged, shellproof 
  command post away from inhabited communities and was required to install a telephone 
  switchboard in a separate bunker. Communications with the command post had to 
  be assured by wire, radio, visual signals, dispatch riders, or runners, and 
  in an emergency by a combination of these various means of communication. Telephone 
  wires had to be laid in such manner that they could not easily be cut by fire 
  or tracked vehicles; wherever possible they were laid along ditches and swampy 
  depressions or strung on trees. Radio trucks had to be dug into the ground in 
  inconspicuous places, protected against fragments, and well camouflaged before 
  the attack started. Then strict radio silence had to be enforced.</p>
<p ><i>d.</i>�� Before the general attack, all reserves had to leave their billeting 
  areas and move into the battle-position quarters which had to be well camouflaged, 
  outside inhabited communities, and ready for immediate use. Telephone, radio, 
  and other communication media had to be readily available.</p>
<p ><i>e.</i>�� The routes of communication to the front were of vital importance 
  and therefore had to be kept open under all circumstances. Bottlenecks had to 
  be avoided, defective stretches of road made serviceable even in inclement weather, 
  and strict traffic control imposed for two-way traffic. Alternate bridges had 
  to be built in suitable places away from the existing ones and provided with 
  approach roads. At least two alternate routes had to be determined through each 
  community so that convoys could detour narrow streets whenever there was danger 
  of air attacks.</p>
<p ><i>f.</i>�� One of the major problems was to intercept massed armored attacks 
  and prevent break-throughs. This involved extensive countermeasures which could 
  only gradually be enforced and slowly integrated into the defense system.</p>
<p >First of all the terrain particularly suited for an armored break-through 
  was mined to a quite unusual extent. Selecting such areas and mining them with 
  due consideration for Russian tactical doctrine presented little difficulty 
  to an experienced panzer expert. The numerous mine fields</p>
<p align="center" ><b>31</b></p>
<hr>

<p >were to be laid in depth and width in a checkerboard pattern in such a manner 
  that the German armored units could detour them on the basis of information 
  received. All signs designating mine fields were removed prior to the enemy 
  attack. No mines were laid in front of the German main line of resistance because 
  the enemy could have removed them and used them for his own purposes before 
  the start of the attack. The main battle position was mined in depth up to fifteen 
  miles to the rear. Prior to the major offensive in the area east of Lvov during 
  the summer of 1944, the sector where the main attack thrust was expected was 
  mined with 160,000 antipersonnel and 200,000 antitank mines within the zone 
  defense. This was the first time that the Germans applied zone defense tactics 
  of the type described in this study.</p>
<p >The most forward divisional antitank guns had to take up positions approximately 
  one mile behind the main line of resistance. The bulk of the artillery and numerous 
  medium antitank and antiaircraft guns were to form centers of gravity behind 
  the forward guns up to twelve miles in depth. In addition, all roads suitable 
  for sudden armored thrusts in depth were blocked by tank obstacles, captured 
  immobile antitank guns, and antiaircraft guns emplaced at all important points 
  up to a depth of twenty-five miles. In case of critical developments numerous 
  self-propelled antitank guns were to reinforce the defense. To camouflage these 
  guns, tank ditches had to be dug and approach roads built in suitable terrain.</p>
<p >The army reserves had to be sufficiently strong to support the front and stop 
  the enemy in case he suddenly shifted his main effort and turned his tanks to 
  an adjacent sector which had not been prepared according to zone defense principles. 
  For instance, during the battle near Lvov the army commander held in reserve 
  five strong panzer divisions which he had withdrawn from sectors that were not 
  in immediate danger. Two of them were to support the front in the center of 
  gravity and the three strongest were to be instantly committed to stop any armored 
  thrust elsewhere in case the enemy shifted his point of main effort. The two 
  divisions assigned to the center of gravity were expected to be able to lend 
  them assistance in due course. The reserves formed mobile battle groups and 
  equipped them with many antitank and assault guns in</p>
<p align="center" ><b>32�</b></p>
<hr>
<div2>
<p >order to enable them to give immediate support to 
  front�line sectors threatened by sudden disintegration. In most cases these 
  battle groups consisted of reconnaissance or motorcycle battalions reinforced 
  by antitank and assault gun battalions which were held in instant readiness 
  and formed advance detachments of their respective divisions.</p>
<p >The task of indoctrinating the unit commanders in all the essential zone defense 
  measures was far from easy. After detailed briefings, map exercises, and tactical 
  walks, they not only grasped the idea but became thoroughly convinced of the 
  expediency and feasibility of the plan and lent their enthusiastic support to 
  its execution. Discussions and training exercises continued down the line to 
  the smallest units.</p>
<p >The next step was to put these measures to their practical test and examine 
  them in the light of experience. Starting with individual arms, these tests 
  were later extended to larger units. Finally, zone defense tactics were adopted 
  and enforced by entire divisions and corps. The tremendous effort entailed in 
  these preparations was to pay high dividends.</p>
<p >The fencer derives an advantage from cutting into his opponent's sequence 
  when the latter intends to strike because the attacker usually exposes himself 
  on that occasion. This intercepting blow was also included in the zone defense 
  tactics. Since the enemy moved his forces close to his most advanced positions 
  and massed them there before jumping off to attack, he exposed himself to concentrated 
  surprise fire from all artillery pieces and rocket launchers. Two basic loads 
  of every type of ammunition had been set aside for just that purpose.</p>
<p >The most difficult and critical problem was to determine the correct time 
  for withdrawing to the battle position. If too late a moment was chosen, the 
  safety measures against the annihilation of the combat forces by an enemy barrage 
  would have remained ineffective. The front-line units and intermediate commands 
  alone were unable to gather sufficient positive clues regarding the hostile 
  intentions to enable the higher echelons to draw the correct conclusions as 
  to when the enemy attack would begin. This can be easily understood since their 
  observation of enemy activities was restricted to the most advanced areas of 
  the front. But well-organized combat intelligence and constant air observation, 
  co-ordinated by the army commander in person, gathered so much information on 
  enemy preparations and covered his rear areas so completely that the H Hour 
  for the attack could be determined with a high degree of accuracy. The most 
  reliable information was secured by radio interception. As much</p>
<p align="center" ><b>33</b></p>
<hr>
<p>as 70 percent of all reliable information was obtained from this source.</p>
<p >The improvised defense system was first applied in the summer of 1944 in the 
  battle of Lvov and for the second time in January 1945 during the second battle 
  for East Prussia. In both instances the Russians attacked at precisely the point 
  and in exactly the manner expected by the army commander who devised this zone 
  defense system. H Hour for the enemy attack in East Prussia was determined to 
  the exact day and hour. In the battle near Lvov, however, the enemy started 
  his offensive two days later than expected. Interrogation of prisoners confirmed 
  that the attack was postponed by two days at the last moment. As a result the 
  evasive maneuver had to be repeated on three successive nights. On the first 
  day the Russians either did not notice the withdrawal because German rear guards 
  left in the forward positions simulated the weak routine harassing fire or they 
  lacked time to react to this sudden change. On the second day they attacked 
  several evacuated positions with combat teams up to regimental strength and 
  pushed back the rear guards.</p>
<p >Even this turn of events was foreseen in the original plan. Strong counterthrusts 
  supported by massed artillery fire from the regular firing positions sealed 
  off the enemy penetrations and at dusk the former main line of resistance was 
  once again occupied by the infantry. As expected, the enemy resumed his attacks 
  during the night to find out whether the Germans would continue to occupy the 
  positions. When these night attacks had been repelled everywhere and the Russians 
  had convinced themselves that the positions were held by their full complements, 
  the fighting broke off and the front calmed down. After midnight the positions 
  were evacuated for the third time and, when the enemy fire concentration was 
  unleashed at dawn, it hit empty positions. The units that had moved into the 
  battle position suffered hardly any losses and, supported by assault guns and 
  one battalion of Royal Tiger tanks, they were able to drive back nearly all 
  Russian forces which had advanced beyond the empty positions. The artillery 
  preserved its entire fire power because the shelling and air bombardment hit 
  the empty battery positions which assumed the role of dummies. Not a single 
  gun, not a single command post was hit. The telephone communications from army 
  down to regiment suffered no disruption. But the former positions that had been 
  evacuated were in poor shape. The towns were badly damaged by air attacks, and 
  the debris of bombed buildings blocked the main roads in several villages. Nevertheless, 
  the traffic continued to move along the previously</p>
<p align="center" ><b>34</b></p>
<hr>
<div4>
<p >designated alternate routes and was stopped only 
  intermittently whenever the enemy air force scored direct hits on convoys.</p>
<p >The reserves were left untouched by the air attacks directed against them 
  since they had moved to locations that were unknown to the enemy. The advancing 
  Russian infantry was hit by the defensive fire of an artillery and rocket launcher 
  brigade which was fully intact and well supplied with ammunition. When the enemy 
  infantry attempted to disperse and take cover it walked straight into the mine 
  fields which had been laid behind the German main line of resistance. This took 
  the momentum out of the attack and prevented the Russian infantry from concentrating 
  its effort in one direction. The advance slowed down and became hesitant. Practically 
  all territorial gains had to be abandoned by the Russians when the German troops 
  that had evaded the destructive effect of the initial barrage started to counterattack 
  later during the day. The distress signals sent out by the Russian infantry 
  brought their armor to the scene. Like a cataract released by the sudden opening 
  of a dam, the massed armor poured across the Seret River into the historic battle 
  ground of Yaroslavichi where exactly thirty years before, during the summer 
  of 1914, Austro-Hungarian and Russian cavalry divisions had clashed head on 
  in the last major cavalry charge in history.</p>
<p >History repeated itself. Once again the Russians had numerical superiority 
  and once again the battle ended in a draw. In 1914 the defender achieved this 
  result by the use of new machine gun and artillery tactics whereas in 1944 he 
  introduced zone defense tactics to overcome his inferiority. On the very first 
  day of the armored attack, the enemy lost eighty-five tanks in the mine fields. 
  The number of tanks lost increased rapidly when the armored thrust came within 
  reach of the antitank guns and was brought to a halt. The losses assumed truly 
  disastrous proportions when the German panzer divisions proceeded to counterattack.</p>
<p >In 1914 as in 1944 the battles for Lvov were not decided by the cavalry charge 
  or the armored thrust near Yaroslavichi but by a major Russian break-through 
  north of Lvov in the adjacent army sector to which the enemy shifted his main 
  effort. Unfortunately for the Germans in 1944, the SS panzer corps with the 
  three strongest panzer divisions had previously been transferred to the Western 
  Front because the Allies had meanwhile landed in France. For this reason sufficient 
  forces were no longer available to stop the Russian armored drive in the new 
  area of penetration.</p>

<p><b><a name="V"></a>V. Improvised Fortresses</b></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>By 1944, after the Germans had suffered a succession 
  of defeats, Hitler frequently tried to reverse the tide by the arbitrary designation 
  of fortresses. In the face of an imminent enemy attack, many towns suddenly 
  became improvised fortresses and had to suffer encirclement and siege as if 
  they were well-equipped strongholds that had been systematically constructed 
  and provisioned over a number of years. A commander was appointed for each fortress, 
  given absolute powers, and put under a special oath. He thereby received authority 
  of life and death over all persons within his jurisdiction and could employ 
  them as he saw fit, even though most of them were merely passing through his 
  territory. These men and their equipment were frequently the only resources 
  at the disposal of the commander who actually was forced to pick them off the 
  streets.</p>
<p >Thus, the city of Kolberg was declared a fortress early in March 1945 when 
  the battle for Pomerania was in full swing. The small city was overcrowded with 
  wounded, the railroad station filled with hospital trains. Columns of refugee 
  carts blocked the roads and enemy tanks were only twenty-five miles off. Precisely 
  at that moment the newly appointed fortress commander who was entirely unfamiliar 
  with the situation was flown in by plane. He was not acquainted with the duties 
  of a fortress commander and had to be briefed in detail. The fortress was absolutely 
  defenseless. Hitler's attention was called to this fact, but he nevertheless 
  decided that Kolberg must be held as a fortress under all circumstances. In 
  his reply Hitler stated that the Spandau depot would receive instructions to 
  immediately dispatch twelve new antitank guns to Kolberg by rail. This was at 
  a time when the single-track railroad line to Kolberg was completely blocked 
  and enemy tanks were expected to appear in the immediate vicinity of the city 
  within a few hours. Obviously, the antitank guns never arrived. The commander 
  was forced to pick his defense force and weapons from the streets. Indiscriminately 
  everybody and everything moving through the city was stopped, whether they were 
  Luftwaffe, naval personnel, damaged tanks, antiaircraft, antitank, or artillery 
  guns, and integrated into the fortress defenses.</p>
<p >It was difficult to imagine why Hitler decided that this former small coastal 
  fort should be defended, unless for historical reasons. In modern times, however, 
  the events that occurred in Napoleon's day could not possibly be repeated. However, 
  the enemy seemed to be impressed by the glorious past of the city because his 
  approach was slow and hesitant. The first Russian</p>
<p align="center" ><b>36</b></p>
<hr>
<div6>
<p >attack was delayed for two days, but the defensive tactics employed by the 
  Germans soon revealed their weakness and after only a few days the enemy captured 
  the city. Most of the entirely improvised garrison was rescued by the Navy.</p>
<p >The location of some of the fortresses was so unfavorable that their defense 
  seemed hopeless from the outset. Despite all remonstrances, even these places 
  had to be held at all cost. For instance, Brody, a small town in eastern Galicia 
  completely surrounded by woods, was located in a valley without observation 
  facilities. Dominated by a nearby plateau in enemy hands, the town was under 
  complete enemy observation and at the mercy of his artillery. At one point the 
  woods even reached up to the edge of the town. Because of the lack of space, 
  there was not even a suitable area for the artillery emplacements in case of 
  a siege. In order to avoid an imminent disaster, the army commander circumvented 
  Hitler's orders and adopted tactics that prevented a siege of the town.</p>
<p >The situation at Ternopol was similar; there the 
  garrison held out bravely for one month only to succumb for lack of rations 
  and ammunition after an attempt to break the siege had bogged down in the mud.</p>
<p >By the end of January 1945 one of the German panzer armies had three of its 
  best divisions in Fortress Koenigsberg, two in Fortress Memel, and only the 
  two weakest at its disposal for operations in the field. At this decisive time 
  an entire army group with the best available troops was hemmed in in Kurland 
  and eliminated from participation in the defense of the German homeland because 
  it had strict orders to hold out in place.</p>
<p >These tactics were championed by Hitler in person and enforced with all the 
  authoritative powers at his disposal. In the end they obstructed all operational 
  freedom and devoured the very substance of the German Army until there was no 
  army left.</p>
<p >But the picture was entirely different whenever the encircled forces broke 
  out and remained intact. In February 1943 Kharkov was surrounded by enemy armies 
  and ordered to hold out in a hopeless situation. In his last telephone message 
  the corps commander called attention to the seriousness of the situation and 
  stated emphatically that the only choice was between losing the city alone or 
  losing the city with all the troops in it. The reply was that &quot;Kharkov 
  must be held to the last man.&quot; On the following morning a second order 
  came through by teletype stating that &quot;Kharkov must be held to the last 
  man but the defenders must not allow themselves to be encircled.&quot; On</p>
<p align="center" ><b>37</b></p>
<hr>
<div7>
<p >the strength of this ambiguous order, the second part of which precluded the 
  first, the encircled corps took immediate steps for a breakout to the rear without 
  the knowledge or approval of army. After two days of hard fighting, which ended 
  with the loss of several hundred motor vehicles, this corps rejoined the German 
  lines. The decision proved to be correct for, together with some divisions detrained 
  in the Poltava area under its protection, the corps was able to launch a counterattack 
  only one month later, recapture Kharkov and Belgorod, and reach the upper Donets.</p>
<p >This example demonstrates very convincingly that 
  it is not of decisive importance to hold a town at all cost but rather to have 
  some forces available for further operations.</p>
<p><b><a name="VI"></a>VI. Defensive Improvisations in East Prussia</b></p>
<p >As the danger of an invasion of eastern Germany loomed toward the end of 1944, 
  tens of thousands of civilians were mobilized to construct a number of continuous 
  defense lines in East Prussia. Everywhere people could be seen digging trenches 
  and defense positions. Altogether twelve main defense lines and switch positions 
  were constructed, many of which were well equipped. Perhaps their most outstanding 
  feature was the construction of improvised machine gun emplacements which were 
  very practical and consisted of two large concrete pipes. One pipe stood upright 
  in the ground and served as the gun emplacement proper whereas the horizontal 
  pipe was connected to the base of the upright one and employed as a personnel 
  shelter. This improvisation offered shelter against tanks, could be constructed 
  in a minimum of time, was easy to transport, and highly effective.</p>
<p >In addition to these defensive positions a continuous antitank ditch was constructed 
  which cut across all roads. Temporary bridges, ready for immediate demolition 
  in case of emergency, spanned the ditch where it cut through the roads. Some 
  18<b>,</b>000<b> </b>laborers were diverted to the construction of this antitank 
  ditch alone, although they were badly needed to build fortified defensive zones. 
  In order that such zones could be prepared at least in the most essential areas, 
  every man belonging to reserve, service, supply, or headquarters units was assigned 
  his daily quota of obligatory digging that was measured in cubic feet. If necessary 
  the work had to be done at night. To get these positions ready for immediate 
  winter occupancy, the rear echelon units as well as Volkssturm battalions moved 
  into the</p>
<p align="center" ><b>38</b></p>
<hr>
<div8>
<p >positions to make the quarters livable. Slit trenches were dug along the roads 
  and antitank and machine gun nests were prepared at all important points. Perimeter 
  defenses were established around every village and hamlet.</p>
<p >The over-all effect of these numerous, fully integrated defense installations 
  was to transform the most vulnerable northeastern part of Germany into one great 
  fortress area. Although some of the defensive positions never played any part 
  in the subsequent fighting, others proved very useful during the battle for 
  East Prussia. If they failed to change the fate of that doomed province, it 
  was due to the entirely insufficient number of troops and to the inadequacy 
  of the weapons which could be mustered for its defense.</p>
