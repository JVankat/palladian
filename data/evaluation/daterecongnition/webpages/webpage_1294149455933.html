&quot;Stoic Disintegration&quot; represents the pain and personal struggles of suffering a 
severe back injury on the job, being terminated because of the resulting 
disability, the two spinal fusion surgeries necessary after the injury, and 
coping with the disappointment of an employer that failed to provide 
compensation for the loss.&nbsp; </p>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Dear Readers,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">Welcome to the
</span><b><i><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue">Work 
Injured Nurses� Group </span></i>
<span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue">Discussion Forum</span></b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">, 
offered in hopes </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">of 
bringing information and mutual support to nurses injured providing care to 
others.&nbsp; Back injury from lifting patients removes more nurses from the bedside 
than any other kind of injury.&nbsp; Nurses may suffer a variety of other 
work-related injuries and illnesses as well.&nbsp; This forum is provided for any 
injured or ill nurse who wishes to participate.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">After 
suffering a work-related spinal injury myself, I discovered what appears to be a 
general disregard of the needs of work-injured nurses.&nbsp; That many nurses lose 
their physical and financial well-being to largely preventable patient handling 
injuries appears to go unchallenged.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Hopefully, 
WING USA will help bring to light the extreme losses of injured nurses, 
including lack of assistance in remaining with their employers.&nbsp; Rather than 
utilizing the knowledge and skills of these experienced nurses in ways that will 
not further harm them, injured nurses are often turned out the door � through 
workers� compensation �retraining,� generally away from nursing into 
lower-paying work, or otherwise.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">My story 
is similar to that of many nurses:&nbsp; I was removed from floor nursing by a 
cumulative trauma spinal injury from years of lifting patients and, due to 
on-going lifting restrictions, by a hospital which does not provide permanent 
light duty for its injured nurses.&nbsp; What happened to me is not at all unusual.&nbsp; 
It appears, from available data, that multiple thousands of nurses have been 
disabled by patient handling injuries and it is quite likely that most of them 
lost their jobs when unable to return to heavy lifting.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">In nursing 
school, along with training in manual patient handling, we were told that nurses 
are at high risk of back injury from lifting patients.&nbsp; We were advised to �take 
care� of our backs and �be careful� lifting patients because our jobs would 
depend on our backs.&nbsp; We were further warned that while most nurses� back 
injuries are from cumulative trauma, workers� compensation typically accepts 
only single point-in-time injuries.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Alarmed, I 
thought, �Why am I taking all of these classes if <i>my job will depend on</i>
<i>my</i> <i>back?!</i>�&nbsp; I dismissed it as too unethical to possibly be true.&nbsp; 
Surely nursing schools wouldn�t allow students to enroll without disclosing such 
a risk.&nbsp; Surely, hospitals wouldn�t require a nursing degree for work they�d 
toss you out of for a hurt back.&nbsp; Surely, if you were injured caring for 
patients, they would help you continue working as a nurse.&nbsp; I tried to shove the 
warning of potential loss of career over a back injury out of mind but continued 
to wonder how it would work out for a nurse with a cumulative trauma back 
injury.&nbsp; I�ve now had opportunity to discover firsthand what can happen to a 
nurse with such an injury.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Estimates 
range from 38% to nearly 50% for the number of nurses who will suffer 
work-related back injuries.&nbsp; The day we were warned in nursing school, I could 
have asked the student on my right and left, �Which of us will it be?�&nbsp; It could 
be any nurse required to physically lift patients.&nbsp; It turned out to be me.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">An English 
study found that almost half of back-injured nurses were unable to return to 
their positions.&nbsp; One researcher found that 12% of those leaving nursing cite 
back pain and injuries as the main or contributing reason.&nbsp; Sadly, the warning 
in nursing school proved to be true.&nbsp; After suffering serious spinal injuries 
from lifting patients, many nurses find themselves in pain and out of work � 
their jobs did indeed depend on their backs.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">The 
injuries seem almost obligatory as nurses are required to lift amounts of weight 
well-documented to be hazardous.&nbsp; Many nurses are unaware that the National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set 51 lbs. as the 
maximum safe lifting limit for men (46 lbs. for women) so that lifting the 
weight of adult patients far exceeds established safety limits.&nbsp; Nurses continue 
lifting patients, and being injured, because they�re taught manual lifting in 
nursing school and then follow the tradition of manual lifting in the facilities 
where they go to work.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Training 
in body mechanics conditions nurses to believe that patients can be lifted 
safely if nurses lift �correctly� while research has clearly shown that there is 
no safe way to manually lift adult patients and that there is little difference 
in the risk of injury whether with one or two lifters.&nbsp; Some suggest that nurses 
need to take responsibility for preventing injury by exercising; others say, 
�It�s not what you lift, but how,� with both approaches appearing to instruct 
nurses to protect themselves.&nbsp; Though physical fitness and body mechanics are 
important, neither address the root cause of disabling spinal injury among 
nurses.&nbsp; Nurses are not disabled by the occasional muscle strain, but by damage 
to spinal structures from extreme compressive forces generated with lifting 
hazardous amounts of weight.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">I once 
calculated that, with all of the lifting, pulling, and pushing involved with 
manual patient handling, I had lifted and moved up to 3,000 lbs per shift.&nbsp; This 
seemed an outrageous estimate until I discovered an Australian source giving 1.8 
tons (3,600 lbs) as the estimated amount lifted by nurses each day � my estimate 
was low.&nbsp; In 1992, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
inspections of nursing homes in Pennsylvania found many nursing aides lifting 
over 5 tons (10,000 lbs) per shift.&nbsp; Data show that nursing aides consistently 
suffer three to four times the number of back injuries as RNs.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Nurses may 
believe they�ll have �warning signs� letting them know when to slow down in 
order to avoid serious injury.&nbsp; Many nurses are unaware that the center of 
spinal discs, where injury from repetitive heavy lifting typically begins, lacks 
pain receptors.&nbsp; Nurses may, therefore, be sustaining severe injury without 
perception of pain � until damage reaches nerves in the outer ring of the disc.&nbsp; 
So, there may be no warning before sudden severe pain announces a 
potentially-disabling injury that may have been months or years in the making.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Many 
nurses are unaware of how cumulative trauma occurs to spinal discs or why 
patient lifting predictably leads to spinal injury.&nbsp; To educate nurses on why 
manual patient lifting is unsafe, please print, copy, and distribute these two 
items:&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Though 
research with safe patient handling through mechanization has proven over many 
years that most patient handling injuries are preventable, the injuries and 
needless loss of nurses continue because the government does not require,&nbsp;most 
employers do not provide, and the nursing community does not demand&nbsp;protection 
from preventable injuries.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">With 
proven solutions readily-available for many years, patient handling injuries 
continue as possibly the single largest contributor to the nursing shortage.&nbsp; It 
is a mystery why protection against preventable disabling injuries, and 
assistance remaining with the employer at injury, are not already in place.&nbsp; 
Enactment of industry-specific legislation by the states - such as Zero Lift for 
Healthcare - will be required to substantially reduce patient handling 
injuries.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Australia 
has shown that a national ergonomics standard will not necessarily reduce 
patient handling injuries.&nbsp; The Australian Nursing Federation (Victorian Branch) 
No Lifting Policy, adopted March 1998, says, �In spite of the fact that Manual 
Handling Regulations have been in place for more than ten years, very little has 
been done by the Health Industry to reduce back injuries amongst nurses.�&nbsp; 
Nurses still had the highest injury rate in the female workforce.&nbsp; 
Industry-specific action, the $7.7 million Victorian Nurses Back Injury 
Prevention Project, led to recovery of program costs in one year, 74% reduction 
in lost days due to injury, 48% fewer WorkCover claims, 54% drop in cost of 
claims, and annual savings of $13 million by preventing back injury to 
nurses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Using 
needlestick safety legislation as a model in the U.S., it took only four years 
from the first state (California) to pass legislation in 1998 until needlestick 
safety was a national mandate in 2002.&nbsp; Needleless IV systems were available and 
were advertised for years in nursing journals � and we nurses wondered why our 
hospitals didn't have them � before legislation required hospitals to provide 
them.&nbsp; Meanwhile, nurses suffered unnecessary needle sticks, some fatally 
infected with blood borne pathogens.&nbsp; Legislation was required to force most 
employers to provide safety needles and needleless IV systems.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">Likewise, 
gentle, mechanical, patient lift equipment and friction-reducing devices, safer 
for nurses and patients alike, have been available for many years, with abundant 
supportive research for injury prevention.&nbsp; We now need state-by-state enactment 
of Zero Lift for Healthcare legislation to force all healthcare facilities, and 
nursing schools, to implement safe patient handling programs with adequate 
amounts of readily-accessible appropriate equipment.&nbsp; As long as this remains 
unaccomplished, the squandering of nurses to preventable injuries will 
continue.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">I wish all 
readers well and hope this forum is of some benefit to injured nurses.&nbsp; </span>
