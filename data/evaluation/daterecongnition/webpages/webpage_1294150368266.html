<b>PH in LA....LBMA volume.</b><br>
 
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">This is the first reference I have seen to the tremendous LBMA Gold volume being primarily involved with currency hedges.  If this is the case, it is a key in understanding what is really going on in the Gold market.  Please elaborate more on this or post your references on the subject.  Thanks in advance.</font><br><br>

<b>Steve's Webpage article</b><br>
 
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">WOW --- Sorry, Steve, I am afraid that I got lost before I got to the NEW paper replacing the OLD paper that the banks created. --  There must be a little moneys on deposit to allow the banks to make loans !  This was never stated, ONLY that the banks made entries to create new Dollars.  -- The only thing of importance was the two paragraphs in RED type. -- I shall await someone that is far more of an Economist that this ol'e engineer, for a review of this theory.<br>&lt;;-)</font><br><br>

<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">Peter, Gandalf, all...Will his concept of notes work?<br><br>kutyn--<br><br>"Moreover, it must be recognized that the manipulation of the gold markets through the gold lending<br>     activities of the central banks has allowed the ownership of both gold and gold companies to be<br>     concentrated in a few powerful hands. Furthermore, the creation of a gold standard would give these<br>     people tremendous power and wealth. It must be stressed that the central banks have manipulated the<br>     gold price downward, not by selling their gold, but by lending it. Had they sold their gold, their future<br>     influence on the price of gold would be greatly reduced. However, by lending their gold, they are able to<br>     cause a substantial future increase simply by having these gold loans repaid (called in).<br><br>     In recent years large quantities of leased gold have been absorbed by the market, indicating that<br>     demand for gold is much greater than generally acknowledged. When bankers ask for the repayment of<br>     their gold loans, and the short sellers that have been supplying the market also become buyers to<br>     cover short positions, we will see a substantial price increase. As it is not apparent where the supply of<br>     gold will come from to meet both the normal demand for gold, as well as to cover repayment of gold<br>     loans, this rise could be very substantial. Should these events occur at a time of severe stock and bond<br>     market weakness, we could see other investors move into the gold market, further fueling the price<br>     rise."</font><br><br>

<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">Thanks MK !  --- far too many GREAT posts to remember you changed the format. --  I believe that the "tone, tenor and complexion of the Gold market on 1 Jan 00 will be as follows:  There will NOT be a Gold market as we now know it beyond 1/1/00 !!!   ---  My crystal ball shows nothing where the COMEX is shown now. -- Zero, ZIP, Notta, the paper has gone up in smoke !!!  The only Gold Market after 1/1/00 will be the offer of Governments to there peoples to do as the Korean Gov. did, please help out your Gov. by giving the Gov. your gold in exchange for promisary notes. -- OR the Roosevelt trick, --  EVERYONE turn in your Gold !<br>---  ONLY one problem, I have not yet figured out what to do AFTER 1/1/00 !!<br>&lt;;-) <br></font><br><br>

<A HREF="http:\\www.usagold.com" target="_blank">http:\\www.usagold.com</a><br>
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">I agree with your thoughts. The sellers of gold have been almost too obvious and clumsy. Except for the public, which accumulates gold coinage under the cover of Y2K, buyers have been invisible and not even a matter of discussion. With each passing day, economic imbalances grow and the ultimate unravelling promises to be messier and more disruptive. Thanks for pointing out that Another has been commenting since 1997, a long time but not a very long time.  </font><br><br>

<b>Comments on some excellent posts and queries:</b><br>
 
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">Usul....I must say that I enjoy your literary style.  Your allusion to Turkish coffee brought to mind the Turkish currency which I happened to encounter while perusing the most recent World Gold Council Gold Demand Trends.  Did you know that in 1993 it took roughly 2000 Turkish Lire to buy an ounce of gold?  It now takes 100,000.  So that Turkish coffee might be a bargain at the village coffee shop putting a higher level of consciousness within a Sufi's reach, but in Turkey that cup of coffee could very well take that Sufi's life savings.  Such are the dangers of currency devaluation to savers.  I look forward to what this thick coffee brings our "wise old gentleman."  P.S.......What are cardamom seeds?  I'm still stuck on Folger's -- hot, fast and with the morning paper. <br>----------------<br><br>The Invisible Hand......I am still wondering if an improvement in the euro's prospects would improve the prospects for gold.  Robert Rubin's parting shot was that the trade deficit could cause major problems for the U.S.  He said the United States could not continue to be the dumping ground for the world's production.  Larry Summers opened with the same refrain.  If we have a weakening of the dollar, will the euro automatically pull up gold with it?? <br> -----------------<br><br>Gandalf.....You need to say something about what the atmosphere will be like surrounding gold January 1, 2000 to perhaps win a silver.  I was listening to a report about these new milers in track the other day.  They said that in Europe the winner of a series of races (using a point system) would get $1,000,000 in gold.  I don't if it was British gold or not.  I did note that pound sterling was not offered.  Made me consider taking up track even at my tender age.  Did you know that they are running the mile now below 3:45?<br>------------------<br><br>Orca....Very much liked your entry.  Did you know that the British seek to replace gold with one currency that is down 15% on they year, a second belonging to the world's greatest debtor nation, and a third wherein the stated policy of the national government that issues it is to devalue it against the dollar.  And all of this was done supposedly as means to properly and sensibly allocate Britain's assets. <br>------------------------<br><br>Jinx....I would like to see the Dinar move out of the talking stage and into reality.  It would change the face of international finance.  <br>------------------------<br><br>Pete....Options represent the right BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION to buy or sell a quantity of metal. Paper. Just paper.<br>-------------------------<br><br>PH in LA.....Good to know you are still in the neighborhood.<br>---------------<br>Lenny Kaplan....Question: If "players" borrow gold just to sell it, then how can lease rates be considered a reliable indicator of higher prices in the future? Just askin�.<br>--------------------<br>Townie.......Wait until the British people realize that the gold sale tanked their currency, drove up the inflation rate and undermined their savings and equities markets.  If Tony Blair thinks he has problems now, wait until the rubber meets the road in foggy Londontown. <br>--------------------<br>Leigh....Count me in the Taylor Caldwell fan club.  I agree with the "awesome" review.  Yes, the increase is from the public.  I have an interesting stat for you though that puts a another spin on central bank sales:  The World Gold Council reports that official holdings of gold including multilateral institutions has gone from 1114.2 million ounces in 1995 to 1075.1 million ounces in December, 1998.  That amounts to about 300 tons per year that has left the central banks and gone to private hands.  Industrialized countries have actually added to their holdings which might come as a suprise to many given the hype surrounding sales.   Annual gold demand is running in the 3500 tons per year range and mine production is now in the 2600 ton range assuming we have any mines in operation by the end of the year.  As you can see, central bank gold sales are much sound and fury signifying nothing.<br>----------<br>CoBra (too).........I must say that though I don't hope for financial Armageddon, I prepare for it nevertheless, as I know you do as well.  To you other descriptions of the paper priests I will add another -- arrogance.  What information do you need in a market that goes up without the benefit of anything close to fundamental impetus?  One does not need a great deal of information, or skill before casting the dice on the table.  Not even the information age will save this crowd once the rabbit starts heading in the other direction.  I met some New Paradigmers golfing recently and they were telling me that one fund manager they knew was having a bad year with a 50% return on his fund while a well known competitor had a 71% return.  I can remember when a stock broker was considered to be miracle worker if he pulled a 10% apr out of the market.   The thought occurred to me that no skill was involved...One manager was simply luckier than the other.  The question is should someone be rewarded on a multimillion dollar scale simply because he's luckier than the next guy.  </font><br><br>

<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">Hello dear long lost friend,<br><br>Thank you for your reply. How have you been? Been out sailing the blue seas lately? I have ANOTHER question for you. Why the ever increasing volume for currency fluctuation protection in PM's in a decreasing price environment?<br><br>Speaking of ANOTHER, a person I dearly miss as I do you, here is a post of his that is very apropos at this time. I thought you might find it revealing.<br><br>Posted on the Internet October 25, 1997 by "ANOTHER" THOUGHTS!<br><br>Why do the Swiss want to sell gold over many years when they could sell the entire lot in a week? Yes, the worldwide trading volume in gold could take the whole load and not drop the price below Fridays close! The reason for the "many long term selling announcements" is to keep the price down over time. The CBs would have you think that their selling<br>would "crush the price"! The real effect would be exactly the opposite. The major world buyers would line up at the door to buy "the last sale of the century! Have you heard any CBs putting out "Proposals to Sell" for their entire stock of gold? Of course not, the response to buy would give<br>off the absolute wrong signal and cause a revaluation of gold.<br><br>It is a far better use of a public asset when they use a small anount of it over time to ensure a reasonable price for OIL! If all gold was sold quickly, there would be no trading medium for deals! How far do you think an IOU would go if it didn't have gold in the background worth perhaps a<br>1,000 times it's current commodity price?<br><br>So what good is this information to the small investor? Not much if you run out and buy gold options, gold stocks, gold futures, etc.! Did you think the following quotes were good for those assets:<br><br>"That is why some "Big Traders" are holding ONLY gold as events unfold."<br><br>" One last note: No form of paper wealth will survive the financial crush once the CBs stop selling! NOTHING! "<br><br>"The market is changing now,,, it will go up but you will not be happy with the outcome."<br><br>"What is happening now is far, far larger than the interest of a few traders or mining companies. They will be stepped on!"<br><br>Gold bullion is being accumulated and cornered on a worldwide scale not seen before! UNDERSTAND THIS: The people who are buying do not expect the price to rise until the CBs slow their selling. They do expect the value of gold to increase in the future even as the banks sell into a rising market. This will happen as the sheer volume of trading completely overwhelms the entire worldwide market! The big buyers fully well expect gold to stop all trading as the governments enact DRACONIAN MEASURES to deal with a worldwide currency problem. The public in general will ask for these measures and to that effect, all paper connected to bullion will become "fair game"!<br><br>My projections and -----: The gold market is not the same as it was in the past, so throw your charts and TA away! Nor will the gold market be the same in the future as it is today, so don't use paper substitutes! Today, gold is much more valuable than it has ever been! During your time a<br>straight forward investment in "bullion only ' will far surpass any other asset you could hold!<br><br><br><br>With the recent sales by BOE and IMF in the future, a little at a time, this game of cat and mouse will go on for a few more months, if not years. IMHO.<br><br>I would like your opinion on how the ever increasing volume at LBMA and the recent increase in the POO might tie into current events?<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Pete</font><br><br>

<b>NY Precious Metals Review: Aug gold steadies after Tues fall</b><br>
 
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">By Melanie Lovatt, Bridge News<br>New York--Jul 9--COMEX Aug gold futures continued their consolidation<br>at lower levels today after falling Tuesday to a fresh 20-year low of<br>$256.50 per ounce following the UK gold auction. Aug settled up 40c at<br>$258.10, while Sep silver settled down 0.7c at $5.263 per ounce. <br><br>   Traders said that gold had managed to see a limited amount of<br>short-covering after Tuesday's fall, but they said that options activity<br>was also responsible for keeping it closeted near its recent range.<br>"We saw some short-covering in London, but the big dealers came in as<br>sellers to protect their options positions," noted Leonard Kaplan, chief<br>bullion dealer at LFG Bullion Services.<br><br>Large dealers had granted $260 calls and it was "important to them<br>that they expire worthless," he said. At the same time, some players who<br>were holding the $260 calls were "trying for $260," he noted.<br>He said that gold is seeing some support from news that the<br>International Monetary Fund is facing increased Congressional opposition<br>to its plan to sell up to 10 million ounces of gold.<br>The proposed IMF sale is unlikely to be approved by the US Congress,<br>lawmakers and congressional staff told Bridge News. If the<br>sale does not go through, this is likely to be worth only $6-10 on the<br>upside rather than $30, he said. When the UK announced its planned gold<br>auction in May, the gold price fell over $20 and then had a further dip<br>just after the sale took place on Tuesday this week.<br><br>Kaplan noted that gold would need to climb over $265 before large<br>amounts of short-covering would be triggered. He pointed out that 1-month<br>lease rates were remaining high, at 2.25%. Rather than a result of<br>physical tightness, this is a symptom of players borrowing it just to<br>sell, he said.<br><br>However, Kaplan said that he had recently started to see strong demand<br>for gold coins. "We've seen a rise in premium due to excellent grass roots<br>demand for coins," he said. He said that physical investors probably<br>consider gold to be a bargain at 20-year lows.<br><br>  --Aug gold (GCQ9) at $258.1, up 40c; RANGE: $259.9-257.0<br><br>(c) Copyright 1999 FWN Reprinted at USAGOLD with permission.

<b>US Congress Unlikely to Back Imf Gold Sale in Current Form</b><br>
 
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">--Rep. Frank to amend gold-sale bill to give support to miners<br>--Clinton administration to continue push for IMF gold sale<br><br>    By Blair Pethel, Bridge News<br>    Washington--Jul 9--The proposed gold sales by the<br>International Monetary Fund to help fund poor-country debt<br>relief is unlikely to be approved by the US Congress,<br>thereby nullifying the IMF's plan to fund its portion of<br>debt relief, lawmakers and congressional staff told Bridge<br>News.<br><br>    Congressional opposition to the sale has become so vocal<br>that US Treasury officials privately concede they will have<br>an uphill battle in their lobbying effort to convince<br>lawmakers to support the proposal, which is part of the<br>fiscal 2000 US budget proposal.<br><br>    Because of the opposition, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,<br>told Bridge News he planned to introduce an amendment to the<br>legislation that would allow the sale to proceed, but would<br>require 10% of the proceeds to be set aside for unemployment<br>insurance for miners in poor gold-producing countries that<br>could lose their jobs because of further gold-price<br>declines.<br>    The IMF is seeking to sell up to 10% of its gold<br>reserves--about 10 million ounces--invest the proceeds in US<br>Treasuries or comparable interest-bearing securities, and<br>use the income generated to fund debt relief for heavily<br>indebted poor countries--known as HIPC.<br><br>    The US Treasury Department estimates that income of<br>around $2.5 billion to $2.8 billion would be generated by<br>this investment over the next 15 years.<br>    But the IMF and central bank sales are pressuring gold<br>prices to a 20-year low. The price decline is hurting gold-<br>producing countries--many of which are HIPC.<br>    Several gold-producing nations have in recent weeks<br>publicly opposed the IMF proposal, most notably Ghana, one<br>of the world's largest producers.<br><br>    Even though Ghana would be helped under the HIPC<br>initiative approved last month by the Group of 8 leaders at<br>the Cologne Summit, Ghana has said the IMF should stop its<br>gold-sale plans. Ghana's Minister of Mines and Energy Fred<br>Ohene Kena told Bridge News the IMF plan would be<br>counterproductive, and falling gold prices would paralyze<br>the economies of gold-producing countries.<br>    "The IMF must find other ways of supporting countries in<br>distress which rely heavily on gold, especially when its<br>price is so low," he said.<br><br>    This plea, together with other notable opposition, most<br>recently from South African President Thabo Mbeki, has<br>resonated among US lawmakers and helped to galvanize<br>opposition to the proposal, congressional staff and<br>lawmakers said.<br>    Legislation has already been introduced by New Jersey<br>Republican Rep. Jim Saxton--and co-sponsored by House<br>Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas--to block the sale of<br>IMF gold unless the proceeds are returned to the nations<br>that contributed the gold to the IMF's reserves initially.<br><br>    Opposition is bipartisan in both the House and Senate<br>because:<br>    --It would hurt US gold producers and cost mining jobs;<br>    --It would hurt poor gold-producing countries overseas<br>more than the debt relief would help, and<br>    --It would provide the IMF with additional resources not<br>subject to extra-institutional oversight.<br><br>    "I don't know of anyone who has explicitly identified<br>with this approach," a senior House staffer said. "While<br>there is a majority of lawmakers who support financing debt<br>relief, none of them support this particular mechanism."<br><br>    The staffer conceded that "there are probably a large<br>number of members who are open-minded" on the issue, but he<br>noted that "there is some high-level opposition, and it's by<br>no means clear to most members that this is the best or only<br>means to finance IMF debt relief."<br>    He stressed that the link between the IMF sale and its<br>Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility is "quite<br>controversial." ESAF is the IMF's concessional lending<br>window, through which it makes interest-free loans to its<br>poorest members. It is also the mechanism the IMF would use<br>to fund debt relief, the procedure working as follows:<br><br>    --When a country qualifies for debt relief, the IMF<br>would make an interest-free loan to it from ESAF;<br>    --The country would then use that interest-free money to<br>make interest and principal payments on its existing stock<br>of IMF debt, ultimately paying it down.<br>    --The ESAF loan would then be repayable--principal only<br>--over an extended maturity, giving the HIPC country in<br>effect zero-interest refinancing of its IMF debt.<br><br>    However, to qualify for an ESAF loan, an HIPC country<br>must meet IMF conditions, which include economic and<br>structural reforms that many lawmakers believe hit the<br>poorest disproportionately hard. Rep. Frank told Bridge News<br>that "I'm for selling gold, but not for the ESAF. It causes<br>problem by forcing adjustment measures which make the poor<br>worse off."<br>    "The bottom line is that the reason we're going through<br>all these circuitous financing techniques with the IMF--and<br>to a certain extent the World Bank--is because the two<br>institutions are unwilling to write down loans. We go<br>through this fiction so it will appear that they are being<br>repaid by their borrowers," a Senate staffer pointed out.<br><br>    While that assertion is certainly true, it is also a<br>fact of life: the IMF has not and will not write off debts.<br>So if IMF debt relief is to be funded, it will have to be<br>funded through ESAF, US administration officials assert.<br><br>    The US Treasury Department also recognizes and hopes to<br>capitalize on what many on lawmakers concede: There is broad<br>support among lawmakers for the HIPC initiative as a<br>concept; the difference lies in the funding. But Treasury<br>believes its efforts will ultimately convince lawmakers that<br>the widespread and long-term benefits of debt relief will<br>far outweigh any losses to an individual country's gold<br>sector.<br><br>    However, administration officials realize that they need<br>urgently to start marshalling their arguments and getting<br>them out to congressmen. Treasury sees 2 types of opposition<br>in Congress--that from gold-state lawmakers and that from<br>lawmakers opposed in principle to the IMF.<br>    Those from gold-producing states should be convinced by<br>arguments that the IMF is designing the proposed sale in<br>such a way as to have little or no impact on the market<br>price.<br>    Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said 2 weeks ago<br>that the sale is being designed in such a way as to have no<br>market impact.<br><br>    However, Treasury is also critical of lawmakers who<br>support the concept of debt relief yet remain opposed to<br>gold sales to fund the proposal. Officials believe opponents<br>of gold sales should make fresh proposals to fund the<br>initiative if they don't support the gold sales.<br>    Rep. Frank said he would support a purely budgetary<br>allocation to fund IMF debt relief. But he recognized he<br>probably stands in a small camp on that issue. Thus he<br>proposed setting aside 10% of the sales proceeds to create<br>an additional social safety net for those hit hardest by<br>both the sales and the adjustment required by the IMF under<br>ESAF conditions. But he recognizes that even that is going<br>to be something of a long shot.<br>    "My sense is that now that some of the African producers<br>have come out against it, it's going to be hard to get it<br>across the Hill," Frank concluded.<br><br>(c) Copyright 1999 FWN Reprinted at USAGOLD with permission.

<b>Pete:  LBMA daily trades</b><br>
 
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">Pete:  The high volume of daily trades should not be taken to mean that 2 1/2 times daily the yearly production of gold is being bought (or sold) by any single entity.<br><br>My impression is that this (seemingly large) quantity of gold is being traded as paper backup to currency denominated trade in normal commerce to protect against currency fluctuations during the time that the trade is taking place.  There is almost always a period of time in international commerce during which the agreement has been made but the actual payment not finalized.  Placing a paper hedge in gold protects both parties against currency fluctuations.<br><br>This is my understanding of the LBMA's volume.  Most of this gold stays sitting in the vaults with nothing more than paper (and/or? electronic) chits changing hands.  The point is, that the gold must actually be there and be available should the trade go bad and delivery be specified.<br><br>Please feel free to correct or add to this interpretation, anyone with a better understanding of this.</font><br><br>

<b>Dear Old Lady of Threadneedle Street</b><br>
 
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">Madam, Thank You! Your recent sale of gold has awoken the common man world-wide and he is now seriously questioning the sanity of the dear Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. Your motives, method, and outcomes force a revaluation of what had to be seen (despite many misgivings over the last 50 years) as a cradle of common sense and leadership ... England and the dear Old Lady of Threadneedle Street.  It is now obvious your current actions fly in the face of that perspective, but in all likelihood are but an aberration... conforming to those now in power driven by their need to compensate for errors on other fronts, not yet obvious to the English people or the world.<br><br>The common man sees common sense as his or her guiding principle. Common sense tells one  not to debase its own assets, values or worth, or turn it over to those who want to value it the least while at the same time coveting its use for their own satisfaction. My dear Old Lady of Threadneedle Street; the common man calls this prostitution. To achieve that one must lie to oneself and to the outside world.<br><br>The lies are covering up something immense. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has devalued not only the assets of the British people, but also their ability to utilize their own earnings in the world and while doing that, also devalued to the tune of another 10%, the assets of the common man around the world, their governments gold holdings,.. no, the common man's gold entrusted to their governments. What pray tell would motivate that kind of behaviour? <br><br>And what about those people now struggling to maintain their own values ... those in the gold industry? This lie (against the very values your Socialist government supposedly serving its people spews out... 'yes! We are for the People') prompts actions that take away the ability for those it supposedly wants to help by perpetrating this lie and at the same time is pushing for more of the same... 'lets sell the IMF Gold and help those poor people'. But first, we will make sure they really need it by putting some 5,000 or 10,000 more of them out of work!

My Mother, my Father and COMMON SENSE taught me that a lie cannot cover up another lie. This will only gets worse before it gets better. Common sense, the guide for the common man, will teach you that.<br><br>We in Canada have given (the Government says we sold it) our gold away. Our money is worth 65% of what it was 25 years ago when we had the gold. Now we are discussing giving up the Cdn dollar and giving in to use of the US currency. When they have it all (The US that is), we will be able to see in full force... that power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely! My British friends.. you the common man; that is exactly what your Government and your dear Old Lady of Threadneedle Street is doing to you now. It is giving you up to the absolute power broker, and you too will soon have nothing but fish and chips (even if it's just McDonald's style) to identify yourselves. And Oh! by the way, you may even have to change the side of the road on which you drive.<br><br>My dear Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. How about some common sense here.</font><br><br>

<b>Today's Gold Market Report</b><br>
 
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">MARKET REPORT (7/9/99): Gold gained slightly in the early going today. Generally,<br>       the market was quiet overseas with the political atmosphere around gold charged with<br>       recriminations against Britain from gold producing countries, like South Africa, who see<br>       the Bank of England gold sales the near-equivalent of an act of war. The market has gotten<br>       very short with gold lease rates on the rise. It appears that a shortage of metal is developing<br>       at these prices. Asian traders were saying that Asia is beginning "to regain its appetite for<br>       gold" according to a Reuters report this morning. <br><br>       James Turk, noted gold analysts, said in his latest Freemarket Gold & Money report that <br><br>       "Gold today is very cheap...to compensate for its adjusted loss of purchasing power, an<br>       ounce of Gold today would have to be $416.56 just to equal the $35 price in terms of<br>       1934-Dollars. But this price must also be increased to adjust for the debasement of the<br>       Dollar in terms of Gold that has occurred since 1934.<br><br>       We can adjust for this debasement with a very simple and straightforward calculation. The<br>       Fear Index today is 1.16% compared to 14.66% in January 1934. Therefore, Gold and its<br>       use as money was effectively 12.6 times more important back then than it is today. So to<br>       reflect this relative importance today in terms of dollars multiply $416.56 times 12.6. The<br>       result is $5,248.66. In other words, if Gold today were to have the same relative<br>       importance within the monetary system as it did in 1934...Ever hear the stories from the<br>       elderly family or friends who explained how they lived through the Depression on $300 per<br>       year? In 1999 Dollars, that's approximately equal to $45,000."<br><br>       For an explanation of the Fear Index we suggest you contact Freemarket Gold and Money<br>       for subscription information.<br><br>       Bridge News reports Ted Arnold, the perennial gold bear now at Prudential Bache, as<br>       saying that the rise in gold lease rate rise points to an official sale. Our sources tell us that<br>       this is not the case -- that if somebody wanted to forward gold all they would have to do is<br>       pick up the phone and sell forward. You do not need to borrow the gold to forward it. It is<br>       an unnecessary and costly step. The rising lease rates, in this source's opinion, are the<br>       direct result of a developing shortage of the metal. This is another indicator that the Bank of<br>       England gold is in fact not reaching the market -- not even as a forward sale. And if that is<br>       the case the shorts are left with no ammunition save jaw-boning the market.<br><br>       That's it for today, fellow goldmeisters.<br><br>       In the latest News & Views, we ramble through the many issues surrounding the gold<br>       market and give the reader a good, solid overview of what's happened in this topsy turvy<br>       market of the last month or so.

<b>Fall of the moneylenders, Part 4</b><br>
 
<font size="-1" FACE="Verdana">The coffee house stood near the main road that opened <br>out into the heart of the busy village, where a visitor could <br>soon find the central market, most of the shops, and a <br>hubbub of people throughout the day.<br><br>It served coffee and tea of many varieties, but its speciality <br>was strong Turkish Coffee. Often times in the coffee house <br>there would be seen a small group of Sufi mystics, who had <br>formed a little community in the village.  They believed that <br>coffee gave them a higher level of consciousness, with <br>which to stay awake for prayer and get closer to God- <br>much to the annoyance of the regular Moslems, who <br>tended to congregate in the next village and shunned <br>the coffee house as a sinful place.<br><br>The wise old gentleman partook of a Turkish coffee; a rich, <br>shimmering ebony liquid, with a thick mud of grounds at the <br>bottom of the flask, crushed cardomom seeds, and a little <br>sugar as was his taste. He sat down on the pillows and <br>thought hard about what he would offer the people.<br><br>He knew, with a deep conviction, that gold and silver were <br>the only real money that counted.  He had long formed his <br>view that, for a trading society to have a long-term stable <br>and prosperous outlook, goods and money must have<br>intrinsic value.  Anything that was really worth what it was <br>tendered for could serve as money, but only gold could be <br>relied upon to stay uncorrupted over centuries, and most <br>other things of value that had been used as money<br>would break a man's back in weight to conduct trade in <br>serious business.<br><br>He knew also that when people contracted a debt with a <br>moneylender, and that moneylender required interest to be <br>repaid, the consequences over much time would be an <br>ever increasing amount of debt which would eventually <br>overwhelm the community and cause the money system to <br>collapse, as the fall of the moneylenders had shown.  But a <br>bank based on gold and silver, and avoiding interest, <br>would be very much like the religious banks in the other <br>village, and the old man knew that they were not to <br>everyone's taste.  He thought of the Sufis, and how they <br>had reconciled their religion with the coffee-house<br>and thought further on his money-bank plan.<br><br>Without interest demanded for loans, it would have to look <br>for other sources of income.  It would have to have merit to <br>bring the people's funds without paying merely for the <br>privilige of holding the money.  And he was determined<br>that the bank would be run strictly as a business, neither <br>especially favouring or offending any particular group, <br>religious or secular.<br></font><br><br>
