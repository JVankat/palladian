<H3>1.</H3>
<P>"This country is like a cake. On the top it is cream. Underneath it is fire." 
So a Hezbollah spokesman told me last June, speaking in the shabby Beirut 
apartment that served as the party's press office until an avalanche of Israeli 
ordnance leveled the building, along with the surrounding neighborhood, in the 
war that flared a few weeks later. Intimated as a bit of finger-wagging local 
wisdom, the clumsy metaphor seemed hackneyed at the time.</P>
<P>Yet it is true that while Lebanon whets appetites with its gorgeous 
landscapes, clement weather, energetic people, and wonderful food, trying to 
consume too much of it tends to bring on heartburn. Just ask the Ottoman Turks, 
the imperialist French, the US Marine Corps, the Palestinians, the Israelis, the 
Syrians, or any number of Lebanese would-be overlords. The country's infernally 
complex ingredients seem chemically incapable of melding into a digestible dish. 
</P>
<P>This wedge of Mediterranean littoral may be densely crowded, yet close 
neighbors manage to live in very different worlds. A Beirut socialite's calendar 
this past season might, for instance, have taken in the abundance of pink cheeks 
daringly displayed at the annual catwalk for fancy lingerie on the ski slopes of 
Faraya, or the opening at Surface, a chic gallery in Christian East Beirut, of a 
startling exhibition by two young women artists titled "Erotika." Another must 
would have been the funeral of Alia Solh, the eldest daughter of Riad Solh, the 
first prime minister of Lebanon after it gained independence in 1943. One of 
five glamorous sisters who married well during the halcyon years before the 
1975�1990 civil war, her obsequies, at the Solh mansion in Sunni West Beirut, 
drew a crush of luminaries from as far afield as New York, Paris, Riyadh, and 
Rabat, including Walid bin Talal, the billionaire Saudi prince, and Moulay 
Hisham, a cousin of the Moroccan king known for his liberal views.</P><SPAN

<P>Of course, should one not be part of Beirut's hedonistic and dauntingly 
<I>branch�</I> elite, the calendar might have looked rather different. Bombed 
out of your cramped walk-up in the Shia southern suburbs during last summer's 
war, you may have moved into the sprawling tent city at Riad Solh Square in 
downtown Beirut. Erected in December by Hezbollah and its allies to shame the 
"collaborationist" government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora into quitting, the 
squalid encampment remains defiantly in place. You may have marched in the 
fervid, self-flagellating Ashura parades that on January 30 commemorated the 
martyrdom of the Shia hero-figure Hussein, or attended the angry funerals of the 
more recent Shia "martyrs" who were gunned down�not far from the Solh mansion�by 
suspected Sunni snipers during sectarian clashes earlier that month. (Or if you 
were Sunni, you might have joined the equally emotive memorial for two Sunni 
youths held in May, after they were kidnapped and executed in apparent 
vengeance.) But perhaps, if you have the misfortune to be one of 400,000 
registered Palestinian refugees, you merely sit, jobless and anyhow barred, 
under Lebanese law, from most decent trades, in a cinderblock shack in one of 
the country's archipelago of little Gazas, dreaming of jihad.</P>
<P>It is easy enough to counterpoint the opulence and squalor, hope and despair 
that remain such close bedfellows here. It is far harder to untangle the network 
of shifting allegiances that make up the spider's-web-in-a-kaleidoscope of 
Lebanese politics. Differences between the eighteen sects that are formally 
recognized in the Lebanese constitution, which reserves political offices 
proportionally for representatives of different religious communities, form only 
part of the puzzle. Other elements include clan loyalties, class, historic 
alliances, ideological currents, the grievances of refugees from throughout the 
region, money interests, guns, and foreign intrigue involving everyone from the 
Vatican to the CIA and Mossad to the rival Shiite seminaries at Najaf in Iraq 
and Qom in Iran.</P>
<P>Scholarly attempts to clear this thicket are fraught with risks, starting 
with the fact that there is scarcely an overarching narrative on which enough 
Lebanese can agree to establish commonly accepted truths. Rather like in modern 
Italy, but more so, this is a place where achieving any sort of closure on 
important national traumas, such as the "Events" of 1975�1990�known to the rest 
of the world as the civil war�has proved dismayingly elusive. Historical 
happenings that elsewhere would be simple signposts on a recognized road become 
instead prisms, used to construct mutually negating paths.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>Take the assassination of Riad Solh. Lebanese schoolbooks 
describe the Sunni leader at the time of Lebanon's independence from France in 
1943 as a national hero. It is true that the National Pact of that year, a 
founding document of the new nation, owed much to a practical meeting of minds 
between Solh, by inclination a pan-Arab nationalist, and Bishara Khoury, a 
Maronite Catholic leader who advocated a more Mediterranean-oriented, 
Christian-flavored Lebanese republic. Their alliance was institutionalized by 
the fixing of a 6�5 Christian�Muslim ratio of parliamentary seats, and a 
division of key powers between a Maronite president (Khoury was the first) and a 
Sunni prime minister. Other sects, it was understood, would have their share at 
every rank in government, including the cabinet, under a system known as 
<I>muhasasa</I>, or apportionment.</P>
<P>That deal brought three decades of uneasy calm and rapidly rising prosperity 
as Lebanon�an island of relative democratic liberty amid a sea of coup-prone 
dictatorships�attracted capital and talent from across the region. Yet the 
ideological seam of Arabism versus Lebanese particularism eventually pulled 
apart. From the beginning, too, the distribution of powers among Sunnis and 
Christians chafed what was then the country's third-largest confessional group, 
the largely rural and marginalized Shia, for whom the topmost allotted post was 
speaker of parliament. It also annoyed the fourth-largest sect, the Greek 
Orthodox. Many were attracted to the quixotic vision of Antoun Saadeh, who 
founded a radically secular and socialist party that sought to incorporate 
Lebanon within a Greater Syria, along with Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, and 
Kuwait.</P>
<P>Following the failure of Saadeh's comically inept coup plot in 1949, he was 
tried for treason and shot. As Ghassan Tueni, the debonair, still-prolific, and 
politically active publisher of the Beirut daily <I>An-Nahar</I>, warned at the 
time, "They have made of him a great giant, stronger than Saadeh ever was, and 
have made him a martyr." Two years later, one of Saadeh's followers created 
another martyr by killing Riad Solh in revenge. To this day, members of the 
Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (which, ironically, was banned in Syria until 
last year) regard Saadeh as a hero and Solh as a villain. </P>
<P>Lebanon's political landscape is thickly littered with such controversial 
martyr-figures. One of them is Ghassan Tueni's own son, Gebran, whose car was 
blown off a mountain road by a powerful bomb in December 2005. Passionately 
opposed to Syrian interference in Lebanon, Gebran Tueni made a rousing call for 
national unity before a million-strong rally on March 14, 2005. It was perhaps 
the most dramatic moment of the so-called Cedar Revolution that convulsed 
Lebanon that spring, forcing Syria to end its three decade-long "peacekeeping" 
presence. Yet many Shias prefer to recall that Tueni once described Hezbollah's 
followers as mindless sheep.</P>
<P>Similarly, the passing of Pierre Gemayel, a young, right-wing cabinet 
minister and vocal critic of Syrian influence, who was gunned down on a Beirut 
street last November, was widely mourned, if only because the ill-fated Gemayel 
clan of Maronite Catholics has produced more than its share of martyrs. (His 
uncle was also assassinated.) But in some quarters of Beirut it was said that 
vengeance had been claimed for Gemayel's unwise public boast that while Muslims 
may have the quantity, "we" Christians have the quality.</P>
<P>Such examples may imply that Lebanon's troubles are simply sectarian. Yet the 
very precariousness of the balance, with Sunnis, Shias, and Christians each 
representing around a third of the population, plus memories of the civil war 
with its 150,000 dead, tend to dampen cross-religious strife. The most vicious 
political sniping often takes place within sectarian groups. Hezbollah's 
sharpest critics are, in fact, dissident Shias. And consider the comments made 
following Pierre Gemayel's death by Suleiman Frangieh, the current don of a 
rival, pro-Syrian Maronite clan. First insinuating that Gemayel was probably 
murdered by yet another right-wing Maronite party, the Lebanese Forces, Frangieh 
reportedly jeered at a visit paid by several widows of slain Christian 
politicians�including Gemayel's�to the eighty-seven-year-old Maronite Patriarch, 
Cardinal Sfeir. Don't they have a man among them to send, he jibed, adding that 
the cleric probably got a hard-on.</P>
<H3>2.</H3>
<P>Of all the modern martyrs to Lebanese politics, few achieved the stature and 
scale of influence, either in life or death, of the Sunni millionaire Rafik 
Hariri. Five times elected prime minister, Hariri stamped a personal style and 
vision on Lebanese society in the years following the end of the civil war in 
1990. His efforts to rebuild the country justly earned him the title of Mr. 
Lebanon bestowed by Nicholas Blanford, a longtime correspondent in Beirut who 
has written a brisk portrait of the man's travails and legacy. The killing of 
Hariri, along with twenty-two others, in a huge blast on Valentine's Day 2005, 
stunned even the drama-inured Lebanese. Shattering fifteen years of relative 
calm, it provoked a wave of revulsion that was to radically alter the face of 
the country.</P>
<P>The son of a poor Sunni orange farmer, Hariri won a scholarship to the Arab 
University in Beirut and eventually, like so many Lebanese, sought his fortune 
abroad. Canny, hard-working, and disarmingly frank, he cashed in mightily on 
Saudi Arabia's 1970s oil boom, building a giant construction firm on a 
reputation for efficiency that drew him extremely close to the Saudi ruling 
family. In one oft-cited incident, he is said to have impressed a royal Saudi 
client by wheeling in jet aircraft engines to quick-dry the cement at one 
short-order palace. He was to leave to his heirs a globe-spanning business whose 
assets have been valued conservatively at more than $8 billion.</P>
<P>During the bleakest civil war years, Hariri spent prodigiously on his home 
country, clearing rubble-strewn roads, sending some 35,000 poor Lebanese 
students through college, and financing repeated attempts to staunch the 
bloodletting by brokering hostage releases and talks between rival militias. 
Finally, in 1989, Hariri's powerful Saudi patrons cajoled Lebanese politicians 
to attend a conclave at Taif, a mountain resort near Mecca, and effectively 
locked them in a room until they succumbed to a deal. The resulting Taif Accord 
updated the 1943 National Pact, reducing the powers of the Maronite presidency 
in favor of the Sunni premiership and Shia parliamentary speaker, and allotting 
parliamentary seats on a 1�1 Muslim�Christian ratio. Wartime militias were to be 
disbanded, but the principle of <I>muhasasa</I> was maintained.</P>
<P>This was hardly to everyone's liking. But the deal was backed by Gulf Arab 
money as well as by Syrian troops occupying the country (who had first entered 
Lebanon in 1976 to prop up flagging Maronite forces, then lingered until all the 
rival militias were exhausted); and it was supported by the understanding that 
Hezbollah would be allowed to continue harassing Israel (whose army had invaded 
in 1982 to wipe out the PLO, then lingered in occupation of the mostly 
Shia-populated South). With those advantages, the Taif Accord eventually stuck 
and Hariri himself became its political godfather, the deal-maker whose cheery 
persona, deep pockets, and diplomatic savvy held the place together.</P>
<P>First elected as prime minister in 1992, he held the job for most of the next 
thirteen years. Hariri's achievements were undeniable. At the civil war's end, 
Blanford writes, "the gaunt, pock-marked skeletons of [downtown Beirut's] 
once-graceful buildings looked as though they were suffering from some vile 
stone-eating leprosy." Ten years later such scars had been all but erased. The 
gutted city center, incorporated as a real estate development in which Hariri 
himself was the prime shareholder, had been recreated as a postmodern pastiche 
of tastefully restored and sparkling new buildings.</P>
<P>This and other big baubles came at a very high cost, not only in money as the 
national debt soared�from $1.5 billion when Hariri entered office in 1992 to $18 
billion six years later�but in political capital as Hariri furiously bargained, 
compromised, and bribed to keep his detractors at bay. As Blanford quotes one 
Hariri admirer as saying, "He was a corrupter, rather than corrupt." Warlords, 
army officers, and Hariri cronies received choice slices of the pie: they were 
offered ministries to expand their powers of patronage, or granted lucrative 
business monopolies. Syrian officials were carefully cultivated with such gifts 
as choice properties or scholarships for their children. Syria's infiltration of 
the police and judiciary went unchecked, as did its arming of loyal Palestinian 
factions, and its backing of Hezbollah as a useful thorn in Israel's side. </P>
<P>By most accounts Hariri was unhappy with all this, but worked with the tools 
at hand. "Some of the people in my cabinet are criminals and should be in jail, 
but I can't do anything about it," he told Augustus Richard Norton, an American 
professor who has written an admirably concise and balanced primer on Hezbollah. 
Hariri's gamble was that with regional peace seeming likely with the Oslo 
process in the 1990s, a revived Lebanese economy could grow itself out of debt. 
Healthier revenues would strengthen the historically feeble central government. 
The combination of reduced international tensions and a more workable Lebanese 
state would obviate any excuse for Syria to linger, or for Hezbollah to maintain 
its unique status as an openly armed sectarian militia.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>It seemed almost to be working, until the year 2000 brought a 
series of setbacks. Peace talks between both Israel and Syria and Israel and the 
Palestinians collapsed. Israel unilaterally withdrew from its "security zone" in 
southern Lebanon, leaving Hezbollah's guerrilla fighters to bask in glory. 
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, a wily and brutal but patient and predictable 
operator, died, passing rule to his son Bashar, whose younger circle resented 
Hariri as too rich, too manipulative, and too friendly with Westerners such as 
the French president, Jacques Chirac (whose political career Hariri had 
supported since the 1980s by investing in ailing French companies and helping 
them secure contracts in Saudi Arabia). Then, when the new administration in 
Washington took office in 2001, it dismissed Middle Eastern peacemaking as a 
waste of time, adopting a belligerent tone toward Syria that pushed Damascus 
into a tighter embrace of Hezbollah and of the party's primary backer, Iran.</P>
<P>Lebanon's enforced calm began to look shaky. Out of latent nationalism, or 
pique at being cut out of spoils, critics of Syrian interference who had been 
quiescent after Taif began agitating for Syrian withdrawal. With Israel gone, 
taboos about questioning the need for Hezbollah's "resistance" militia lifted, 
even as Syria and Iran began supplying it with thousands of rockets. Syria's 
allies in Lebanon, led by President Emile Lahoud, a former general widely 
disparaged for his perpetual tan and rank loyalty to the Assads, grew 
increasingly obstructive of Hariri's growth-oriented policies. The economy 
slowed, foiling Hariri's hopes for debt relief even as his public began to blame 
him for rising prices, heavier taxes, and the widening gulf between rich and 
poor.</P>
<P>These tensions grew following the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. To some, the 
demise of Saddam's regime happily augured a similar fate for Syria's Baathists, 
or at least a forced retrenchment that could free Lebanon from their clammy 
hold. Many of Hariri's political allies began, quietly, to align with America 
and with France, which saw Lebanon, with its Francophone traditions, as both a 
natural zone of influence and a means for coordinating policies with America 
following France's break over Iraq. Lebanon became one of the few places in the 
Middle East where the Bush administration's promotion of a "freedom agenda" 
gained wide public traction.</P>
<P>But other Lebanese factions, equally nationalist in their own eyes, drew 
starkly opposite lessons from the fall of Baghdad. Fused with pan-Arabist and 
Islamist versions of history, America's military intrusion onto Arab-Muslim soil 
furnished perfect evidence of a continued Western plot�of which Israel had 
already formed one chapter �aimed at weakening and exploiting the region. The 
imperative was to stop this from happening, by checking America's ambitions in 
Iraq, by supporting Syria, which had always posed as a bastion of Arabism, by 
retaining a deterrent against Israel, and by punishing would-be 
collaborators.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>By late 2004, a confrontation seemed imminent. In early 
September France and America, perceiving a chance to prise Lebanon out of 
Syria's sphere, secured a Security Council resolution that demanded both the 
disarming of Hezbollah and the prompt holding of presidential elections to 
replace the unctuous Lahoud. Suspecting Hariri of having secretly lobbied for 
the resolution, Bashar al-Assad had called him to Damascus several days before 
the resolution was adopted and, a tearful Hariri told friends, threatened to 
"break Lebanon over his head" if he obstructed Lahoud's return to office. 
Rallying allies in Beirut, Syria forced a constitutional amendment through the 
parliament to extend Lahoud's term by three years, which passed the day after 
the UN resolution was adopted. Some MPs later explained that they, too, had 
received blunt threats. A further warning came in the form of a car bomb that 
badly injured Marwan Hammade, a Druze cabinet minister and close friend of 
Hariri's.</P>
<P>Shaken, Hariri voted reluctantly for Lahoud's extension in office. But soon 
after, finding Syria's allies blocking him at every turn, he resigned. By late 
2004 Hariri found himself increasingly pulled toward outright opposition to 
Syria. With elections looming in the spring of 2005, his still-powerful 
political machine, bolstered by Western backing and amplified by his generous 
bankrolling of the press, turned its energy toward forging a broad alliance 
uniting Syria's increasingly numerous and outspoken enemies. In January 2005, 
Hariri told Syria's proconsul in Lebanon, General Rustum Ghazale, that he would 
choose his own candidates, rather than accepting Syrian nominations as in the 
past.</P>
<P>His death by a car bomb came a month later. Rather than thwarting the 
opposition alliance, the spectacular assassination speeded its success, uniting 
Hariri's Sunni constituency in outrage with the traditionally anti-Syrian 
Christians. Within a month, huge street demonstrations had shamed the pro-Syrian 
cabinet into resigning. Within another month, Syria had been forced to withdraw 
the last of its troops. Elections in the summer of 2005 produced a sweeping win 
for the Hariri machine, led now by his son Saad, in alliance with large Druze 
and Christian blocs. The cabinet it eventually formed, with Fouad Siniora, an 
economist and long-time Hariri henchman, as prime minister, comprised a careful 
balance, including representatives of Hezbollah and even associates of the 
widely loathed president.</P>
<P>By the end of that summer, the Syrian-installed heads of Lebanon's police and 
intelligence branches languished in prison, having been fingered by an ongoing 
UN probe into the Hariri assassination. For the first time in Lebanese memory, 
it looked as if justice might actually be served for a political crime. More 
than that, the ever-so-elusive hope of a regenerated, confessionally equitable, 
and truly independent Lebanon seemed suddenly possible.</P>
<H3>3.</H3>
<P>Yet even at this moment of apparent triumph, dangerous cracks were appearing. 
Hariri's political heirs, now known as the March 14th alliance, sorely lacked a 
leader of his caliber. In haste to complete Syria's exclusion, they dismissed 
calls for electoral reform, running the vote under a Syrian-tailored system that 
Christians complained diluted their voice. They also alienated supporters by 
allying tactically with pro-Syrian Hezbollah, simply in order to thwart an 
emergent Christian block, known as the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), which had 
formed around the figure of General Michel Aoun.</P>
<P>As commander of the rump national army toward the end of the civil war in the 
1980s, Aoun had mounted a reckless challenge to Syria's then-tightening grip. 
The messy finale of his defeat, in 1990, saw some of the most destructive 
fighting of the war. Aoun fled into exile in France, returning, like Napoleon 
from Elba, during the spring of 2005. Exploiting his aura of resistance to 
Syria, as well as widespread suspicion among Christians of the Hariri camp, Aoun 
quickly gained a broad base of Christian support.</P>
<P>Underestimating his strength, the March 14th group declined to bring Aoun 
into the coalition. Even after his FPM won an estimated 60 percent of the 
Christian vote, Aoun's insistence on his "right" to a hefty quota of cabinet 
seats pushed the Hariri coalition to keep him at arm's length. Aoun now lost no 
opportunity to attack the government. He even swore to block moves to unseat 
President Lahoud, unless he were guaranteed the post for himself.</P>
<P>More immediately disturbing, March 14th leaders continued to be stalked by 
sporadic murder attempts. Car bombs killed Samir Kassir, a popular writer, and 
George Hawi, a former Communist Party leader, in June 2005. Minister of Defense 
Elias Murr survived another in July, and May Chidiac, a prominent television 
anchor, another in September. Gebran Tueni and Pierre Gemayel were not so lucky. 
All, incidentally, were Christians, Gemayel the son of a former Maronite 
president. Periodic pipe-bombings of Christian neighborhoods also served to keep 
tensions high.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the UN investigation into Hariri's death began to alarm Syria, as 
progress reports noted the Assad regime's clear motive for doing away with Mr. 
Lebanon, and cited "converging evidence" of high-level complicity between Syrian 
intelligence officers, their Lebanese counterparts, and a network of radical 
Islamists known to have ties with Syria. At the request of the Lebanese 
government, the probe was extended to include later assassinations, with the 
clear implication that these were all related to a central purpose, the most 
obvious one being to stop Lebanon slipping out of Syria's orbit.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>But the hardest crack to repair, and the easiest for Syria to 
exploit, grew out of Hezbollah, and particularly the party's adamant insistence 
on retaining its growing stock of arms. The Security Council demanded 
disarmament of all "militias," and most Lebanese would have liked to see 
Hezbollah tamed. But in a speech in May 2005 the party's soft-spoken and 
charismatic leader, Hassan Nasrallah, ominously declared that he would "cut off 
any hand that reaches out to our weapons."</P>
<P>The Shia party's fierce attachment to the notion of perpetual "resistance" 
sprang partly from its origins in the darkest years of the civil war, when the 
impoverished Shia suffered more than other sects both because they had no 
militia, at first, to protect them, and also because they happened to lie in the 
path of Israel's frequent forays into South Lebanon. There was a strong 
ideological element, too, as Sheikh Naim Qassem, Hezbollah's icy 
second-in-command and chief intellectual, makes clear in <I>Hizbullah: The Story 
from Within</I>, his own history of the group.</P>
<P>Qassem exalts the culture of martyrdom in almost fetishistic terms, citing a 
willingness to die as the ultimate weapon of the weak against the strong. 
Resistance to Israeli and Western plots to control the region, he declares, 
should be consecrated as "the foundation block for a society of forbearance that 
prides itself on its achievements and sacrifices, strengthening such resistance 
further and responding to it."</P>
<P>This is, in fact, the kind of Spartan society that Hezbollah has created in 
the zones under its control, which include large swathes of southern Lebanon, 
the eastern Bekaa Valley, and Beirut's densely populated southern suburbs. Built 
around a tight network of party-provided services, including television and 
radio, schools, hospitals, orphanages, and other charities, it is an almost 
exclusively Shia world. The only element that provides wider appeal, for fellow 
Arabs and Muslims, is Hezbollah's determination to fight Israel to the bitter 
end. Hence, again, the attachment to arms, and the impetus to continue attacking 
Israel even after its abandonment of Lebanese territory.</P>
<P>It is for this reason, too, that Iran remains so closely linked to the 
prot�g� that it helped create in the 1980s. As a revolutionary regime that seeks 
to universalize its ideology, Shia Iran has used Hezbollah's appeal as a 
successful fighting force to enhance its own legitimacy among Sunnis, who make 
up 85 percent of the world's Muslims. With the government in Tehran apparently 
captured by hard-line ideologues following the election victory of Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad in August 2005, and with Iran facing growing hostility from the 
West, the usefulness of Hezbollah has only grown.</P>
<P>The facts that Iran and Syria have been allies since the early 1980s and that 
both supply Hezbollah with arms are obvious reasons for the group to align 
itself, in local Lebanese politics, with pro-Syrian forces. But there is a 
broader rationale, as Qassem argues. Lebanon can never be neutral, he asserts. 
Its geography and politics impose two alternatives, allegiance either to Syria 
or to Israel. "It is natural of us to choose the former," he concludes.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>Other Lebanese would dispute this Manichaean worldview. But as 
events were to make clear, Hezbollah had yet another reason to be touchy about 
its weapons. The militia had accumulated such a vast arsenal of rockets and 
sophisticated anti-tank gear, and built such an elaborate infrastructure of 
tunnels, shelters, and concealed positions, that it would, its leaders thought, 
have been a shame not to test these against the Zionist enemy.</P>
<P>Hezbollah could be confident that the Lebanese army, many of whose officers 
and men were in any case sympathetic to the party, was in no position to take on 
its better-armed, -trained and -motivated guerrillas. But Hezbollah, surprised 
by the anti-Syrian passion ignited by Hariri's killing, began to look 
politically and even culturally isolated. To other Lebanese, the aura of pride 
that surrounded the party after Israel's cut-and-run departure back in 2000 had 
worn off. Even among those who still identified Lebanon's fate with Syria's, 
there were many, especially Sunni Muslims, who questioned whether Hezbollah was 
simply a pawn in a bigger game between America and Iran, whose sacrifice would 
hurt the Lebanese.</P>
<P>But as pressure gathered to find some sort of compromise, with some 
suggesting the militia be redesignated a part of the army, Hezbollah played a 
political trump card. In February 2006 it forged a pact with General Aoun and 
his FPM. This marriage of convenience made even many of the general's own 
supporters gasp. Here, suddenly, was the loudest champion of Lebanon's 
independence, and a Christian to boot, joining forces with an Islamist ally of 
Syria and Iran. But the deal has proved oddly resilient, bolstered, grumble many 
Lebanese, chiefly by Hezbollah's support for Aoun's presidential ambitions in 
the upcoming presidential elections this fall.</P>
<P>It survived even last summer's war. Despite the fact that Hezbollah provoked 
the fighting with a raid that captured two Israeli soldiers, Israel's wildly 
disproportionate revenge rallied even many Christians to the party's defense. By 
the war's end, Prime Minister Siniora's government, which could do little more 
than appeal to its Western friends to intervene, and whose calls were ignored by 
a Bush administration intent on having Hezbollah clobbered, was seen by many 
Lebanese, and not just by Shias who bore the brunt of the destruction, as 
virtually a collaborationist regime. Hezbollah's forces were, of course, badly 
mauled in the war, and forced by the peace to withdraw from Israel's border. But 
the party had, in effect, relegitimized its guerrilla force, and subsequently 
gained points by mounting far more effective efforts at reconstruction than the 
state.</P>
<P>The intervening months have reinforced a seemingly intractable polarization 
between two powerful factions, each claiming to represent the will of the 
people. On one side stands the Western-backed Siniora government, holding most 
of the institutions of state and a slim parliamentary majority. On the other is 
the Hezbollah-led opposition, grouping a range of pro-Syrian parties with 
General Aoun's movement and President Lahoud. In sectarian terms, the division 
splits Christian Lebanon in half, and aligns the vast majority of Sunnis and 
Druze (who make up 5 percent of the population) against the vast majority of 
Shias.</P>
<HR class=section-break>

<P class=initial>Since November 2006, the opposition has denied the legitimacy 
of the Siniora government, on the grounds that the resignation of all the Shia 
members of Siniora's cabinet renders it in breach of <I>muhasasa</I>. The Shia 
speaker of parliament has refused to summon the legislature until such time as 
Siniora creates a "national unity" cabinet giving the opposition enough seats to 
veto legislation. This has blocked movement on key issues, most notably 
Lebanon's ratification of a UN plan to set up an international tribunal to try 
suspects in the Hariri and other assassinations. The government charges that 
this blocking is precisely Syria's objective; it dismisses the "national unity" 
idea as simply another way to achieve the same goal. This has blocked movement 
on issues ranging from electoral reform to improving conditions for Palestinian 
refugees. It was the Lebanese parliament's inability to ratify UN plans to 
create an international tribunal to try suspects in the Hariri assassination 
that led to the Security Council's resolution on May 30, ordering the court to 
be set up. Stopping the tribunal is, in fact, the main aim of Syria and its 
proxies, the March 14th movement contends.</P>
<P>During the winter, Hezbollah and its allies sought to force a way through 
this logjam by means of mass protests. Highly organized as always, the party set 
up a tent city in front of Siniora's office. But when a day of strikes and civil 
disobedience in January quickly degenerated into ugly sectarian clashes, the 
opposition relented. Siniora's government has, in fact, proved tougher than its 
opponents expected. By most accounts it has actually won defectors, particularly 
from the Aoun camp, as ordinary Lebanese became weary of the uncertainty that 
now risks wrecking yet another summer tourist season. Yet neither side is strong 
enough to impose its will.</P>
<P>With President Lahoud's mandate expiring in the fall, Lebanese fear a 
constitutional vacuum, and perhaps even an eruption of general strife, unless a 
compromise candidate is found. Under the Lebanese system, presidents are chosen 
by parliament, not through a general election, and must be Maronite Christians. 
General Aoun could choose to jump camps, in the hope of being backed by the 
March 14th "pro Democracy" movement. Such a move would leave Hezbollah 
dangerously isolated. But the ruling group, and indeed many ordinary Lebanese, 
are wary of the general's maverick tendencies. Settling on an alternative may 
prove very tricky.</P>
<P>It was in this grim setting that the latest dramatic events erupted, this 
time in the Palestinian refugee camp of Nahr al-Bared near Tripoli on Lebanon's 
northern border with Syria, where fighting in late May between the Lebanese army 
and a radical Sunni cult in the camp killed scores and wounded hundreds. The 
flare-up, the bloodiest internal strife since the civil war, was not unexpected. 
As Bernard Rougier points out in <I>Everyday Jihad</I>, his thorough and 
disturbing account of the spread of Salafist jihadism among Lebanon's persecuted 
Palestinians, the squalid camps are a perfect breeding ground for radical 
ideas.</P>
<P>Control of the country's twelve camps was once in the hands of the PLO. After 
the forced departure of Yasser Arafat in 1984, most fell under the sway of 
Syrian military intelligence, which Rougier asserts did much to fragment them 
politically and isolate them economically by sponsoring Lebanese laws that, 
among other things, ban Palestinians from owning property or holding 
white-collar jobs. Once much admired, the educational standard of the camps 
collapsed. As secular parties failed to bring improvements to their lives, or to 
their prospects for return to Palestine, youths abandoned them in favor of the 
more desperate, more encompassing, and currently more telegenic ideal of a 
pan-Islamic jihad.</P>
<P>Syria's withdrawal in 2005 created a dangerous security vacuum in the camps, 
which are barred to Lebanese forces under a 1969 agreement. Many Lebanese 
suspect that Syria, which is known to have sponsored jihadists in Iraq, 
continued to fund and arm operatives, setting them loose as saboteurs with the 
long-term aim of reasserting their own role as Lebanon's power broker. But with 
the global spread of jihadism, it was perhaps natural that foreign militants 
would gravitate toward Lebanon's camps as a haven and recruiting ground.</P>
<P>The emergence of the jihadist organization Fatah al-Islam at the Nahr 
al-Bared camp appears to have resulted from a mix of Syrian plotting and 
internal factors. Its leader arrived in Lebanon last year, armed with plenty of 
cash, after being released from a Syrian jail. Most of his several hundred 
followers came not from the camp but from Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Syria, and 
elsewhere, often via the jihad-field of Iraq, yet another consequence of the 
Iraq war. Camp residents resented the intrusion and largely disliked the 
newcomers' rigid puritanism, but according to many accounts, they also admired 
the fighters for their zeal and experience fighting in Iraq.</P>
<P>It was a matter of time before the mix of Lebanon's own tense internal 
situation and such pockets of jihadism would explode. At the time of writing it 
was not clear if the battle would strengthen or weaken the Siniora government. 
Initially it united Lebanese, including Hezbollah, which may agree with the 
Salafists' aim of liberating Palestine but knows they regard Shias as heretics, 
and prefers itself to "own" the Palestinian issue in Lebanon.</P>
<P>But as civilian casualties rose, so did the chorus of counteraccusations 
between Lebanese factions. Hezbollah announced its opposition to the army 
raiding the camp, raising suspicions that it wanted neither to see the precedent 
of a militia being disarmed, nor to see the state gaining in stature. The 
government would have liked to exert its role as the legitimate defender of 
Lebanon, but with many civilians still trapped in the camp, the likelihood of a 
bloodbath raises the prospect of unrest spreading to other Palestinian camps. 
The only thing clear about this new conundrum, now piled atop so many others, 
was that for all its own fractious internal squabbles, Lebanon ultimately 
remains hostage to the regional ur-conflict over Palestine.</P>
