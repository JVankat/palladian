      [EDITOR'S NOTE: <I>Today, Rogue looks at Diana Corporation, whose stock rocketed
      to stratospheric levels earlier this year before falling back dramatically.
      Is Diana's technology of real value? Or is it just a shell?</I>]
      <P ALIGN=LEFT>
      <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3>Peter Lynch, Warren Buffett, and most other
      successful investors insist that one of the best ways to lose money in the
      stock market is to invest in technology stocks you don't understand. In the
      midst of investor fads, this axiom may seem like merely quaint folk wisdom.
      For nearly a year, anything even vaguely connected to the Internet soared,
      and speculators savvy enough to ride the wave have made some fast and easy
      money.</FONT>
      <P>
      But woe to those who believe the hype even if they can't understand the
      technology. When the wave crashes, your portfolio may well be nothing but
      a shark's next meal.
      <P>
      Investors in Diana Corporation <a href="http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=DNA" onClick="openWindow('http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=DNA', 'quotebox', 640, 460); return false;">(NYSE: DNA)</a> know the feeling. The stock rode
      a wave of manic momentum buying from a 52-week low of around $10 a share
      last fall to an all-time high of $114 late this past spring. [See Diana's
      performance for the year: <A HREF="#DIANA">DNA Quotes: Weekly for 1 year</A>.]
      <P>
      This stock went tidal on news that Diana, which still derives most of its
      revenue from distributing meat and fish, had turned itself into a provider
      of supposedly cutting-edge data switching devices.
      <P>
      But then the frenzied buying was over, and within months---hear the Dick
      Dale surf guitar?---wipeout. The stock has been treading water between the
      low 20s and mid 40s ever since.
      <P>
      Even at those prices, though, Diana is still nothing but a pipe dream according
      to New York investment advisors and highly visible short-sellers Asensio
      &amp; Company. An active participant on several stock boards in THE MOTLEY
      FOOL, company president Manuel Asensio has issued a number of press releases
      denouncing Diana as nothing but a fraud run by scam artists. The stock isn't
      worth more than $5 a share, he says.
      <P>
      Asensio is hardly an unbiased source of information. With an undisclosed
      but presumably still significant short position in Diana, he has an interest
      in spreading negative news that will drive the stock price down. Some would
      even say he's willing to make up negative news. And many individuals who've
      crossed his path find him pompous, self-promotional, and generally annoying.
      <P>
      On the other hand, it's still relatively unusual for short-sellers to launch
      public campaigns against a company the way Asensio has. While investors may
      not like short-sellers, carefully considering the shorts' arguments, whatever
      their merits, can often be a constructive exercise. For one thing, it often
      becomes easier to dismiss a company's critics once you know what they really
      think. For another, shorts may open one's eyes to an ill-considered investment.
      <P>
      Last Tuesday, October 15th, Diana stockholders were encouraged to question
      what they do and don't understand about the company's prospects when Asensio
      &amp; Company issued a strong sell recommendation in the form of what appeared
      to be a devastating 16-page report on the company's much-touted Internet
      technology. Asensio put out a press release summarizing the findings and
      took the unusual step of posting the report on the Web (available at
      <A HREF="http://www.asensio.com/">www.asensio.com</A>).
      <P>
      After conducting "an exhaustive technical software and hardware evaluation"
      of the company's products, Asensio concluded that Diana's "performance claims,
      which form the basis for any anticipated growth, are wholly false and incorrect."
      The company's products are "completely uncompetitive" and "it is technically
      and economically impossible to attempt their resurrection."
      <P>
      The report concluded that "the Company's performance will continue to deteriorate
      for the foreseeable future. We see no reason for any investor, particularly
      investors with a fiduciary duty, to purchase or hold this security."
      <P>
      Asensio's report hit the wires in the morning, before the market opened.
      Within the first hour, Diana's shares were trending down from $32 to a low
      of $28.75. The company then asked the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading
      in the issue pending a news release. Five hours later, the wire services
      picked up Diana's response to Asensio.
      <P>
      Without specifically addressing any of Asensio's charges, James J. Fiedler,
      Chairman and CEO of Sattel Communications (the Diana subisidiary that sells
      the switching technology) came out swinging.
      <P>
      "[Asensio's] purported 'news release' is false and misleading. This apparent
      manipulative style of 'news' releases is obviously only aimed at attempting
      to put pressure on the stock price by an acknowledged short seller. I believe
      that our customers who have employed our products would be greatly surprised
      to learn that features and capabilities that they use every day somehow do
      not exist, as alleged by the short seller."
      <P>
      The company's press release also indicated that Sattel was "in possession
      of a letter which states in part as follows: 'This letter provides written
      documentation regarding a request offered to me by a Manuel Asensio, representing
      Asensio &amp; Co., New York, New York in September of this year, to perform
      a negatively biased engineering analysis on the Sattel products and organization
      for a fee of $5,000 dollars plus a percentage of the profits made short-selling
      Diana Corp. stock...' The analyst refused, citing the untruthfulness of the
      premise."
      <P>
      Finally, Fiedler said that Sattel has recently hired 12 new salespeople,
      additional R&amp;D personnel, and a new CFO, suggesting the company was indeed
      growing. In a phone interview with ROGUE, Fiedler said that Sattel now has
      20 fulltime employees working on R&amp;D with 8-10 fulltime consultants at
      any point in time plus four other companies doing subcontract work. All total,
      he estimated R&amp;D man-hours per month were in the high 40s. "We're probably
      spending 25-30% of our revenue on R&amp;D," he said.
      <P>
      In the press release, Fiedler also said that Sattel expects to report about
      $4 million in revenues with a modest profit (instead of a forecasted loss)
      for the quarter ended September 30, 1996. When the stock re-opened about
      ten minutes before the close, it quickly rallied to end up $3.25 to $35.75.
      <P>
      Diana short-sellers were dismayed by these developments. They contended that
      Asensio had contracted an expert consultant with special insight into the
      relevant technical issues. In their view, Fiedler's response was an attempt
      to distract investors from the substance of Asensio's charges by refocusing
      attention on Asensio's inarguably self-serving motives.
      <P>
      Several shorts charged that Diana misrepresented the material nature of the
      news release in order to stop the bleeding in the stock. Asensio simply said
      that "the company's representations to the New York Stock Exchange were false
      and fraudulent." The shorts argued that the company was simply trying to
      buy time to work up a response and line up buyers for the stock once it
      re-opened.
      <P>
      "Absolutely false," said Fiedler. "I can tell you that people called us and
      asked what's going on, and we said we're preparing a response. Period. We
      didn't say what it was going to say. ... We didn't go out and solicit buyers
      for the stock."
      <P>
      Fiedler said he believed the halt was appropriate due to the "blatant falsehoods"
      in Asensio's report and the confusion in the market that it created. And
      as for the timing of the re-open, Fiedler said the company issued its press
      release at 2:19 pm, but that the NYSE wouldn't open the stock until the Dow
      Jones News Service picked it up, which took more than an hour. Fiedler said
      they probably would have just re-opened the stock the next day if they had
      known the trading would re-commence with only a few minutes left in the trading
      day.
      <P>
      For the last ten days, Asensio and Fiedler have been trading shots at each
      other. Asensio said his attorneys have served both Diana and Sattel with
      the demand that they produce the letter mentioned in their press release.
      In his own press release, Asensio affirmed that "Asensio &amp; Company have
      never offered any cash, any fee, or any percentage of any trading profits
      to any analyst, advisor, or consultant for any negatively biased or untruthful
      report on the Diana Corp. or on any other company."
      <P>
      Fiedler declined to make the letter public, but in a follow-up news release
      this past Monday, Sattel indicated that they had received a second letter
      from a different consultant whom Asensio allegedly approached with a similar
      offer to produce a negative report on Sattel's technology. Fiedler said that
      the first letter came from an outside consultant who "has done work for us
      in the past" but that the second letter came from a consultant with no such
      ties to the company. Sattel has turned both letters over to their counsel,
      who are expected to pursue the matter with the proper authorities, presumably
      the SEC.
      <P>
      This public battle is great theater, but so much smoke does not necessarily
      guarantee a fire. On the other hand, Asensio is not the only party to express
      skepticism concerning Diana's prospects. Numerous reports in the financial
      media have puzzled over the company's surprising re-fashioning of itself
      from meat and fish distributor to Internet highflyer.
      <P>
      <B>A Real Transformation? </B>
      <P>
      Indeed, in a July article, ROGUE even examined claims made by some investors
      that Diana was an old-fashioned Wall Street promotion orchestrated by leading
      New York City hedge funds, some of which have recently been selling or
      registering to sell huge chunks of Diana (see the newly amended S3-A showing
      that Arthur and Joseph Samberg of New York's Dawson-Samberg, among others,
      plan to liquidate their holdings). The checkered histories of Diana CEO and
      chairman Richard Y. Fisher and president Donald E. Runge (who sold a large
      block of shares this summer) suggest that anything may be possible.
      <P>
      [Check out our earlier look at Diana:
      <A HREF="/foolwire/96archive/sp0724c.htm">7/23: When Should Investors
      Worry?</A>.]
      <P>
      With 5.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding and a recent stock price
      of around $30 a share, Diana's market cap is $159 million. Yet the shorts
      make a strong case that neither current nor foreseeable earnings can justify
      this share price. The company lost $0.17 a share in 1995 and $0.76 in 1996.
      Trailing 12-month earnings show a loss of $0.93 a share. Asensio estimates
      that Diana will lose $1.25 a share for fiscal 1997, ending in March.
      <P>
      On September 4th, Diana announced its unaudited first quarter results for
      fiscal 1997. Net sales increased to $87.2 million from $81.5 in the first
      quarter of 1996. However, the company reported a net loss of $1.3 million
      ($0.27 per share based on shares oustanding prior to the recent 5% stock
      dividend) compared with a loss of $0.4 million ($0.10) in the first quarter
      of 1996.
      <P>
      The heavier losses followed from reduced earnings by Diana's C&amp;L
      Communications business and increased losses at the Atlanta Provision Company,
      the meat and fish distribution unit that Diana has been unsuccessfully trying
      to sell off for more than a year. This unprofitable unit accounts for 85%
      of the company's sales.
      <P>
      The key to Diana's future, however, is supposed to be Sattel Communications,
      the now wholly-owned subsidiary that's in the business of marketing
      telecommunications switches. The unit was formed in 1994 as a joint venture
      with Sattel Technologies Incorporated (STI). At that point, Diana was trading
      at $3.50 a share.
      <P>
      In the last year, STI has swapped its entire 50% interest in Sattel for shares
      of Diana. Diana's recently amended 10K indicates that STI just cashed out
      its last 4% of Sattel in exchange for 15,000 shares of Diana. The latest
      amended S3-A filed Monday October 21st, however, shows that STI has registered
      to sell all of its 330,000 shares.
      <P>
      While Diana's stock is trading on great expectations for Sattel, switch sales
      for the last quarter were only $840,000, $796,000 coming from the sale of
      two Digital Switching Systems (DSS switches) to California-based Internet
      service provider Concentric Network Corporation (CNC) and the remaining $44,000
      from what Fiedler described as a "small upgrade to a previous customer."
      <P>
      For the fiscal second quarter ending in September, Sattel's projected $4
      million in revenues also come mainly from sales to Concentric. According
      to Fiedler, Sattel sold five DSS higher-capacity switches to Concentric in
      the second quarter, with each costing about $600 thousand, he said. The two
      switches sold in the first quarter were upgraded (at a cost of about $200
      thousand each) in the first weeks of October and should appear as revenues
      in the third quarter.
      <P>
      Still, this means that of Sattel's $4.8 million in projected revenues for
      the first six months of fiscal 1997, a total of seven switches sold to Concentric
      accounted for $3.8 million in sales. Fiedler said the additional $1 million
      in sales for the second quarter came from shipments of of 2-3 switches to
      perhaps two other customers. He said he did not know yet what sales had been
      booked in the second quarter versus the third and could not release the names
      of customers at this point.
      <P>
      These numbers, however, suggest the importance of Sattel's contract with
      Concentric. In July, Diana announced that it had finalized a deal whereby
      Concentric would purchase 21 DSS switches within the next 12 months. According
      to Concentric spokesperson Donna Laughlin, CNC is in the process of transforming
      its 214 points-of-presence (POPS) in the U.S. and Canada into 21 SuperPOPS
      by the end of calendar year 1997, and each of these SuperPOPS will include
      a Sattel switch.
      <P>
      Originally, investors speculated that 21 switches would amount to $42 million
      in sales for Sattel. But the company's switches can be purchased in
      configurations costing anywhere from $125,000 to $4 million according to
      spokesperson Tony Squeglia. Customers typically buy the basic switch and
      then add capacity over an extended period of time as their business grows.
      In that sense, the ultimate value of the switch sales depend a great deal
      on the market success of Sattel's customers.
      <P>
      Fiedler says that the Concentric switches may generate $2 million a piece
      "over a long term horizon, but certainly not right away." If CNC reaches
      the success level they're shooting for, "yeah, they could be worth that much.
      But that's over a life cycle" of the switch, which could be several years.
      Though Fiedler suspects that Concentric may eventually purchase more switches
      as their business grows, he says "there is no commitment from Concentric
      for more than 21" switches at this time.
      <P>
      Based on Fiedler's comments, the sales of switches to Concentric seem to
      be on a pace to generate only about $12.6 million over the next year or so.
      Moreover, Diana last week amended its 10K filing with the SEC to indicate
      that the Memorandum of Understanding between Sattel and CNC was "nonbinding."
      <P>
      The Concentric deal has sparked widespread skepticism since it at least appears
      to have been secured by a $5 million bridge loan from Diana, suggesting that
      Diana has essentially paid Concentric to accept the DSS switches and thus
      validate the company's technology.
      <P>
      In a phone interview, Asensio said that he believes Concentric agreed to
      the switch deal because Concentric was unable to pay its overhead expenses
      at the time.
      <P>
      "[Concentric] could not make their payroll. There was a company that was
      doing the financing, the financing had failed, they were cash flow negative
      with no money in the bank. And they were offered $5 million in return for
      a very soft promise possibly to buy a telephone switch. Now that's a deal
      that anyone would make, and that's the deal they made."
      <P>
      Yet Fiedler says that these were "two very separate transactions."
      <P>
      "We were looking at putting up a wholesale network to sell to smaller, regional
      ISPs. We'd done the evaluation. We knew how much capital it was going to
      cost. Concentric made the suggestion to us that rather than build our own
      network and probably spend 12 months to do it in terms of putting up sites
      and so on that they were in the process of going out to do a round of funding,
      and that if we wanted a participate in the funding that a) we would get a
      stake in Concentric and secondly we would have access to the Concentric network
      at a very favorable cost. The advantage was that their network was already
      up and running."
      <P>
      Sattel orginally planned to invest about $5 million along with its recently
      announced strategic partner StreamLogic also pumping in $5 million. But CNC's
      funding was oversubscribed, meaning they only needed $2.5 million from Sattel.
      But because of delays in reaching an agreement over the wholesale business
      and delays cause by the involvement of international investors, Concentric's
      fund-raising deal didn't close in June as expected. At that point, CNC came
      to Fiedler and asked for a $5 million secured loan to tide them over. As
      security, CNC offered Sattel common stock, interest on the loan, and warrants
      equal to 15% of the stock.
      <P>
      In August 1996, the loan plus interest was converted into 3,729,110 shares
      of CNC Series D Preferred Stock. In September, Sattel sold 1,838,235 shares
      of this stock to StreamLogic for $2.5 million. As Fiedler explained, "The
      money that I had lent them was converted to equity. I got my stock, I got
      my warrants."
      <P>
      The recently amended 10K states emphatically that the $5 million loan "was
      not a condition of the Memorandum of Understanding" regarding the sale of
      switches. In addition, it appears that Sattel's investment in Concentric
      was limited to $2.5 million which has since been converted into what Fiedler
      estimated was a 2-3% equity position in Concentric.
      <P>
      "The deal was actually a good deal in my opinion for two aspects," Fiedler
      said. The distribution arrangement will allow Sattel to save perhaps 12 months
      and require less capital than would have been the case if Sattel had constructed
      its own distribution network. Second, Fiedler believes Concentric is a sound
      investment due to the company's expansion plans and content deals with WebTV,
      Intuit, and Sega Genesis. "I have faith in their strategy. Unlike lot of
      ISPs, they are really concentrating on content."
      <P>
      But confusion over the switch sales and loan to Concentric justifiably raised
      questions about Sattel's prospects. And the fact that CNC still accounts
      for the overwhelming majority of Sattel's sales should leave investors somewhat
      uneasy.
      <P>
      This is especially true since Diana is working with Hambrecht &amp; Quist
      on a restructuring that, according to Diana's Fisher, would "make Sattel
      Communications a 'pure play' by separating it from Diana's other subsidiaries."
      <P>
      Fiedler said, "We absolutely could miss by a week or two, but we're shooting
      for early November" for announcing the details of the restructuring." It
      probably wouldn't be effective for another 45 or 60 days" since the documents
      would need to pass SEC scrutiny and the deal would need to be approved by
      shareholders. According to public documents, however, there "can be no assurances
      that any such transaction will take place, nor can there be any assurances
      as to the timing or value of any such transaction."
      <P>
      Since Diana's Sattel subsidiary is clearly supposed to be the company's principal
      growth vehicle going forward, shorts and other critics have focused on that
      part of the business. Last week's report represents Asensio's most thorough
      attempt yet to discredit Sattel's technology and burst the Diana bubble once
      and for all. The report argues that, rather than offering any performance
      advantage over competitors, as Diana has claimed, Sattel's technology is
      dated and all but obsolete with essentially no sales potential and certainly
      nothing that would justify Diana's current market cap.
      <P>
      In this past Monday's press release, Fiedler said that the report clearly
      indicates that Asensio "has no understanding of our products, technologies,
      competitors, and markets, and that his decision to purposefully communicate
      inaccurate and misleading information does a grave disservice to our customers,
      our shareholders, and our employees. . . . [W]e suggest that Mr. Asensio
      ask the consultant that wrote the report for a refund."
      <P>
      [Check out a description of Asensio's report: <A HREF="#ASENSIO">10/25: Asensio's
      Report</A> and Sattel's detailed response: <A HREF="#SATTEL">10/25: Sattel's
      Response</A>.]
      <P>
      If Asensio contends that Sattel's technology simply cannot do what the company
      says it does, Fiedler argues that Asensio simply doesn't understand what
      the technology is supposed to do, or the problems it is meant to solve. One
      obvious way of figuring out if the technology works would be to talk with
      Sattel's customers. But Concentric has refused to go into any detail about
      the switches, and discussions with other Sattel customers have offered a
      mixed picture.
      <P>
      The inter-exchange carrier Lightcom has operations in San Antonio, Texas
      and main offices in Washington, DC. Lightcom bought two Sattel DSS 3000 switches
      about a year ago and has helped beta test the company's recently announced
      adjunct processor platform that provides enhanced 800 number translations
      and time of day routing features, among others.
      <P>
      According to Julian Bart, director of operations for Lightcom, the Sattel
      switches have worked well. There were some software bugs with the adjunct
      processor platform early on that have been fixed by Sattel. Overall, he said
      the company was satisfied with the product. He also said Lightcom can and
      might expand the switches up to 10,000 subscriber lines and that the company
      plans to buy three more switches over the next five years. He would not reveal
      what Lightcom paid for the switches.
      <P>
      Bart is also an enthusiastic supporter of DataNet. He said he's discussed
      the product at length with Sattel's developer and engineer. "To me it's probably
      one of the most innovative products to come down the pike." He said Lightcom
      doesn't need it yet. "But there's no doubt about it, we will."
      <P>
      He also said Lightcom doesn't have SS7 capability at the moment but he expects
      they will at some point. "We have not ordered it yet. We're waiting until
      we get a little bit more network up and then we'll go with the SS7."
      <P>
      Datacom (DCI), an ANSI and local exchange carrier that provides tandeming
      and blocks of minutes primarily for corporate customers in Miami, purchased
      a DSS switch in September. (Fiedler could not confirm whether this purchase
      landed into the second quarter or not.) The company has four employees and
      reported sales last year of less than half a million dollars. The switch
      is believed to cost about half that much and was secured with a capital lease.
      <P>
      Company president Anthony Harper said, "We're very satisfied with the switch.
      We're very satisfied with the company's support, as well." He said the switch
      includes SS7 capabilities. Though he said that it is not a distributed switch,
      he also said the switch is easily updated because of built-in redundancies
      that allow changes to be made "while it's hot."
      <P>
      Harper said he chose the Sattel switch for price and because it was more
      scaleable and versatile. He said software upgrades can be expensive but that
      Sattel offered an attractive deal in this regard.
      <P>
      A third Sattel customer contacted was Jerry Hamilton, director of international
      technical operations of Rochester-based Frontier Communications. Hamilton
      purchased a DSS96 in December of 1995 to link up to a switch in Russia, an
      application that was very small and static and thus required simply the lowest
      cost solution. The switch cost less than $100,000.
      <P>
      The switch has "been fine. It definitely has its place," he said. But Hamilton
      suggested this the switch is most useful for smaller applications.
      <P>
      "Once I get above where I'm at now, it stops becoming effective for me because
      when I start getting into the larger applications, then the other manufacturers
      of true international gateway switching (Northern Telecom, Erickson, etc)"
      start looking more attractive. "You go ahead with high up-front costs because
      the feature sets offered with the switch offset trying to grow it on the
      smaller basis."
      <P>
      He also said that Sattel doesn't currently offer the kinds of international
      SS7 variants that he needs, so it's unlikely he'll be in the market for more
      switches from them. "A prime consideration is SS7, and I have to talk on
      several different flavors of SS7. I want to be able to accomodate other types
      of signaling as well. I can do that as long as it's not SS7. The SS7 on the
      Sattel switch has not been deployed, it's behind."
      <P>
      "I need a great deal of flexibility without having to wait," he said. "As
      I roll out new features and services, I have to have a device that I know
      will interface with the rest of my network. So I'm going to tend to go with
      the vendor who is already known to provide those applications."
      <P>
      He also said that while "you can just keep tying the frames together" to
      get up to 10,000 ports, "that's not necessarily a real efficient way to do
      it because you lose some of the capacity by tying it to the frame next to
      it."
      <P>
      Fiedler said that Hamilton is correct. "He's talking about C7, the international
      version of SS7. C7 has an international version almost for every country."
      Sattel doesn't have a Russian variant of C7 running, which would make it
      impossible for Frontier to use Sattel technology with its Russian customer.
      <P>
      Despite Sattel's thin customer base at the moment, Fiedler believes the company
      is poised for tremendous growth. "We're sure as hell not going to stay at
      $4 million" per quarter, he said. "We obviously believe that we're on a growth
      curve, or I wouldn't be here."
      <P>
      He said the that the $4.8 million in revenues expected for the first half
      of fiscal 1997 "isn't going to be a fifth of the revenue" for the year. "Are
      we going to do more than double next year? Well, if we do our job."
      <P>
      Asked if he could justify the $200 target price bandied about earlier this
      year by Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Joe Noel, Fiedler made an attempt.
      Taking the second quarter run rate of $4 million, and considering that the
      company made a little money, "it looks like we have a lot of capability in
      terms of earnings per share."
      <P>
      "I leave it to the gods as to what PE ratio they put on this, or any company
      by the way." But he said a PE of 40-50 based on his expectations for earnings
      would land the stock in Noel's range. For fiscal 1997, Fiedler said he expected
      $25 million revenue "or more." For fiscal 1998, "I would be grossly disappointed
      if we doubled it. A good company on a roll should be able to triple it."
      He said the margins are running 25%, suggesting the company could do $4 or
      $5 dollars a share, or total earnings of about $20 -25 million for fiscal
      1998.
      <P>
      "So if you did a hundred million in revenue, you'd be there, based upon the
      way they're doing PE. ... Will I step up and guarantee that? Hell no. Do
      I think that's outrageous? No."
      <P>
      Given such optimistic predictions from Sattel's CEO, it's somewhat difficult
      to account for the actions of STI, the company that sold Diana the switching
      technology. Though there are several steps in STI's agreements with Diana,
      STI appears to have sold its stake in the once jointly owned subsidiary for
      330,000 shares of Diana, currently valued at around $10 million. What's even
      more interesting, the recently filed amended S3 shows STI registering all
      of these shares for sale.
      <P>
      ROGUE could not reach George M. Weischadle, Sattel board member and chairman,
      president, CEO and majority stockholder of STI. So it's hard to know when
      STI will actually sell these shares. But it's at least curious that STI seems
      anxious to unload its stake sooner rather than later.
      <P>
      According to Asensio, "It's up to market participants to correctly price
      capital assets. The people who provide research, who are in the market, who
      give advice to people, those are the people who set the prices for stocks.
      It's a fallacy to sit back and think that the NYSE or the SEC is going to
      police the market to such an extent that frauds like this will not be perpetrated
      on the market."
      <P>
      Of course, it's not at all clear that Diana is a fraud. If an investor believes
      Fiedler's comments and the rebuttals issued by Sattel in response to Asensio,
      there seems to be nothing in Asensio's charges that should give investors
      pause. On the other hand, there's very little earnings visibility for Sattel
      despite Fiedler's ambitious plans for growth. Discussions with Sattel's few
      customers offer a mixed picture.
      <P>
      But more speech ought to be better than less when it comes to making markets
      more efficient. Whatever the merits or faults of Asensio's report, publishing
      it on the Web at least gives all investors access to the shorts' main arguments
      even as it clearly serves Asensio's own financial interests. Still, those
      arguments should make Diana investors look more closely at whether they do
      indeed understand the business they've invested in.
      <P>
      At the very least, the report has triggered a series of detailed financial
      and technical disclosures from Diana and Sattel that clarify the Sattel's
      business. But the soap opera, no doubt, will continue.

      <A NAME="ASENSIO">ASENSIO'S REPORT</A>
      <P>
      According to the Asensio report, "Sattel claims that its Digital Switching
      System ('DSS') telephone switch is 'technologically advanced' and offers
      features and performance capabilities that are either not available or superior
      to those of their competitors. The Company claims that the DSS can handle
      up to 375,000 Busy Hour Call Attempts (BHCA), which is equal to approximately
      104 cells switched per second.
      <P>
      "It also claims that the DSS has an extraordinary expansion capability
      ('scalability') from 96 line side ports to a maximum line side port capacity
      of 10,240 ports. Each single 'line side port' services one subscriber's telephone
      line. In addition, Sattel claims Signal System Seven ('SS7') and ISDN
      connectivity. These claims form the basis for Sattel's large sales projections,
      which the Company has made but never attained.
      <P>
      "Even if Sattel's products actually performed according to the Company's
      claimed specifications the DSS would not in any way be unique or special.
      However, we believe the truth is that none of these claims are correct. In
      fact, we believe that because of inherent limitations in the DSS software
      and hardware technology it is not economically and technologically feasible
      for the DSS to ever achieve or even come close to achieving these performance
      claims, which are already being offered by many of its competitors. To the
      contrary, based on a complete hardware and software engineering evaluation,
      we believe that these products are inferior to those offered by the majority
      of Sattel's competitors."
      <P>
      The report says that the DSS was developed by Sattel Technology before 1989
      as part of a large system sold to Indonesia's public telephone company to
      link hard-line telephone facilities to a Hughes satellite. The only significant
      sales of the product have occurred in Indonesia, where a total of 37 switches
      were sold prior to 1994.
      <P>
      In total, only 60 DSS switches have ever been sold. And Diana has made no
      significant improvements to the technology. Indeed, the report offers a detailed
      step-by-step analysis of the product's shortcomings.
      <P>
      In terms of hardware, the report argues that DSS uses a centralized switch
      matrix rather than a matrix distributed over line cards like more modern
      systems. This old design limits both the number of ports and the kinds of
      new features that can be added to the system, making it less competitive
      than rival systems designed by Summar Four or Excel.
      <P>
      Also, the line cards used by DSS have no processing capabilities, meaning
      the main processor must control every facet of the line cards' activities
      through the use of a dedicated control bus rather than an internal signaling
      packet such as a High Level Data Link Control.
      <P>
      "Such designs are rare, if not unheard of today, as virtually all modern
      switching designs employ distributed processing elements on line cards with
      dedicated internal packet bus to service them."
      <P>
      What this means, to take only one example, is that when an end user picks
      up a telephone handset, the dial tone must come from the central computer
      rather than the DSS line card. Smart line cards are essential if a system
      is to be readily extended.
      <P>
      The report also questions Sattel's claims for the system's call switching
      capacity. The faster switching models available now use the SS7 digitial
      protocol, and they can only handle 35 calls per second. DSS does not employ
      this advanced technology yet Sattel claims that DSS can handle three times
      as many calls.
      <P>
      "We believe Sattel's call capacity claim is false. Based on the capabilities
      of other more advanced platforms, and on the limitation inherent in the [sic]
      Sattel's DSS architecture, it is highly unlikely for the DSS to achieve this
      call handling performance."
      <P>
      The Asensio study also challenges Sattel's claim that DSS can support up
      to 10,240 ports. The dated DSS line cards can only support 16 ports per card
      while the DSS only has room for 42 DSS line cards, suggesting a total capacity
      of only 672 ports.
      <P>
      "It is physically impossible to support the line-side port capacity as specified
      by Sattel on the DSS platform in a single DSS enclosure utilizing their 16
      port analog line card." And linking up several enclosures is "impractical
      if not impossible," and would make the system more costly than that of
      competitors.
      <P>
      The report raises other technical points as well. Unlike modern switches,
      the DSS depends on software loaded onto the Electrically Programmable Read
      Only Memory (EPROM) used for common household appliances, such as microwaves.
      This makes the system incredibly inflexible even though the dynamic market
      it targets requires "constant software updates and enhancements to make it
      compatible with a wide variety of telecommunications environments." This
      problem suggests "further deficiencies in the software operating system and
      dated software architecture as a whole."
      <P>
      In fact, this fundamental DSS architecture makes maintenance of the system
      difficult. Unlike modern products that use a graphical user interface on
      a PC with Windows and allow maintenance from essentially any terminal on
      a LAN or WAN, the DSS is maintained though Ascii terminals using characters
      only.
      <P>
      The lack of hard drive storage makes it impossible to download data from
      an ethernet port or store network management packages from third party vendors.
      <P>
      These structural problems follow in part from the dated "assembly language"
      software code that DSS employs. More modern switches use C, C++, or Java.
      Because of the technical expertise required to write new code for this unwieldy
      system, the study asserts that "Sattel will find the maintenance and evolution
      of its software near impossible." Even if that basic software were completely
      chunked, the system's fundamental architecture would still make the platform
      "unmaintainable."
      <P>
      These issues become a concern, in particular, when addressing the R1/R2 in-band
      signaling protocols, which actually vary in different foreign markets. Sattel
      says that DSS supports the generic international standards, but the DSS cannot
      be readily tailored to fit the specific protocols in each market since data
      tables cannot be downloaded into the switch (as Excel does). Nor can customized
      software from floppy disks be loaded onto a hard drive (as Summa Four does).
      <P>
      The R1/R2 protocols are embedded in the core EPROM software. Sattel will
      have to customize this generic code for each new country it goes into. Given
      the company's small engineering staff, this would appear to be a burdensome
      if not impossible task.
      <P>
      Finally, the report asserts that the DSS does not in fact possess SS7 or
      ISDN connectivity capabilities, important requirements for most advanced
      telecommunications networks. Sattel appears to be working to "patch" SS7
      functions onto the platform by employing New-Net's AccessMANAGER product.
      "Most of Sattel's product claims actually belong to New-Net," the report
      says. But such system integration takes time, even for companies such as
      Summa Four which, unlike DSS, have a switch with a programmable interface.
      <P>
      Sattel is trying to build a custom interface that would run at 19,200 baud.
      But New-Net is designed to interface via a faster port, like an ethernet,
      which DSS does not support. So the limitations of the DSS will limit handling
      capacity regardless. "We believe that even if ultimately successful with
      [the] SS7 project, due to the limitations brought on by the switch matrix,
      interface, and line-card, the DSS will still in no way improve its competitive
      position."
      <P>
      The Asensio study also looks at Diana's claims for Sattel's DataNet switch,
      a switch that in theory could be used either separately or in conjunction
      with the DSS. DataNet is said to afford Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
      a significant cost advantage over other switching technology.
      <P>
      But Asensio says that DataNet is made of "off-the-shelf modems purchased
      from US Robotics" and that DataNet can only work in conjunction with a series
      of other third party technologies. The arcane specifics of this process should
      encourage investors to study the technology before leaping to invest in it.
      <P>
      While ISPs do need an efficient way to bring data from remote dial-up facilities
      to their central computer center, which is what Sattel insists it's offering,
      "many local calling solutions already exist, which are far more advanced
      than what Sattel is offering," the report says. Intelligent routers sold
      by Cisco, 3Com, Bay Networks, and Cabletron, "do far more than Sattel's DataNet,
      allowing conversion of the analog modem traffic into TCP-IP before even
      transporting over leased facilities."
      <P>
      Sattel's DataNet provides no such advantages, merely converting analog data
      to a digital format at one end of an ISP.
      <P>
      "Further, nothing technically significant is introduced at the ISP POP side
      that provides any advantage over other products now available from some of
      the above mentioned suppliers. DataNet is a very low level data multiplexing
      solution that any network manager could put together himself with a few days
      and a Black Box catalog. In short, DataNet realizes no new technical achievements
      or product abilities that the market has not long ago solved and has developed
      beyond."
      <P>
      The Asensio study concludes by examining Sattel's chances for selling switches
      to regional Bell operating companies, competitive local exchange carriers
      (such as MFS/Worldcom), wireless local loops, companies involved in shared
      tenant services, long-distance carriers, foreign companies, Internet Service
      Providers, or video server systems. In each case, the study concludes that
      Sattel's technology doesn't stand a chance.
      <P>
      In the Internet market, "better products already exist." And for most of
      the telco markets, the lack of SS7 or Advanced Intelligent Network protocols
      mean that DSS simply cannot provide what companies need. The basic hardware
      and software architecture will only add to the company's problems in marketing
      DSS overseas due to the R1/R2 protocol obstacles.
      <P>
      The study concludes that long distance, where even low end switches could
      be used, is the only viable market for DSS, but only if the product is "extremely
      price competitive." Strong competition from the likes of Summa Four, Excel,
      Harris, Redcom, and ITT/CoreTelco mean that the DSS switch "would be the
      bottom end product offering at best."
      <P>
      The report also argues that due to technological deficiencies, neither the
      DSS platform nor the DataNet product offer "anything that will give a customer
      any advantage, nor will it allow that customer to integrate services that
      they may require in the future from products that exist today, or will be
      developed."

      <A NAME="SATTEL">SATTEL RESPONDS</A>
      <P>
      In Monday's press release, Sattel's Fiedler charged that the Asensio report
      is "blatantly inaccurate and a gross misrepresentation and distortion of
      the facts. Our products use current technologies. Our DSS Switches are SS7
      capable for central office (Class 5) switching operations; have a hierarchy
      of mass storage devices; have Ethernet capabilities; utilize X windows---a
      Unix-based graphical user interface; use distributed switching matrices in
      addition to its centralized matrix, and are scalable from 96 to 10,240 lines
      in multiple frames."
      <P>
      Fiedler said that contrary to Asensio's report, multiple frames are commonly
      used by major central office manufacturers such as Lucent, Nortel and Siemens.
      The idea that this is less efficient is "totally bogus," he said. And he
      said that the switches' distributed matrix uses line cards with Motorola
      single-chip processors that can handle sophisticated functions.
      <P>
      Indeed, in our phone interview, Fiedler expressed bewilderment at Asensio's
      charges regarding the switches' SS7 capabilities. "It runs on an adjunct
      processor, on a [Sun Microsystems] Sparc that you can run externally or plug
      into your chassis. What you do is you write the interface software for your
      switch and the set, you don't write SS7." According to Fiedler, other major
      switch manufacturers such as Nortel rely on NewNet's SS7 stack, which he
      says has over 50% market share.
      <P>
      In terms of maintenance Fiedler claims the Sattel switches have even more
      flexibility than products produced by Summa Fourand Excel, which are in any
      case not Class 5 switches and thus do not qualify under the new
      telecommunications law for use by alternative telephone service providers.
      <P>
      Calling him "Nonsensio," Fiedler laughed at Asensio's charge that the DSS
      switches lacked flexibility because they were coded in assembly language.
      "I got a real kick out of that cause years ago I use to write operating systems.
      When they're talking about only appliances use it, you should tell that to
      the guys at IBM and Sun Microsystems," Fiedler said. "All systems have to
      have some assembler, or they won't work."
      <P>
      "The core switching component of the DSS absolutely is in assembly language.
      The DSS also uses C++." He said that the switch functions are coded in assembly,
      but that all of the support functions such as the applications and the support
      for peripherals are in C+ or C++.
      <P>
      As for the company's DataNet capability, Fiedler reiterated the company's
      view that the product works and that it can lower an ISP's costs significantly
      as it allows them to transmit four times the amount of data that can be
      transmitted today over standard T1 lines.
      <P>
      "Let's put real blinders on and say, I'm not going to do anything but be
      an ISP, and number two, I don't care what my line costs are. Yeah, functionally,
      you can buy different kinds of equipment" such as that offered by Ascend,
      Cascade, or US Robotics.
      <P>
      "But forget about the equipment: the real problem is the line costs. Right
      now, you can go to any of the big ISPs today that do residential, or home-office
      kinds of customers. All of the ISPs are in the red at the gross margin level
      because of the flat-rate pricing."
      <P>
      In some cases, the line costs per customer run as high as $800 a month. But
      ISPs can only put 20 customers on a port. If they are only charging $19.95
      per customer per month, they can't help but lose money since the would need
      to charge $40 per customer based on their basic line costs.
      <P>
      "That's the kind of thing we're replacing," Fiedler said. "It has nothing
      at all to do with, is the [competitors'] equipment good. I think the equipment
      is probably very good, but I can't afford $40 a month per person."
      <P>
      Fiedler said the key to lowering an ISP's costs is not the switches per se,
      but whether you can get rid of the line costs. Cheaper equipment won't help
      reduce costs nearly as much as cutting out these line charges. The Datanet
      allows ISPs to "get rid of a lot of the local access lines. We're co-located
      in the long-distance carrier's point of presence. And because we are a class
      5 switch, we qualify under a lot of different tariffs to provide lower cost
      lines that do the same function.".
      <P>
      Sattel has said that they have customers who are using DSS switches with
      SS7 or Datanet installed. Yet in phone interviews with both Fiedler and Squeglia,
      neither would provide the names of these customers.
      <P>
      According to Fiedler, Concentric is not running the SS7 since it doesn't
      pay off at this point for Internet providers. The supposition all along has
      been that Concentric is indeed using the DataNet product. Even the amended
      10K states that the non-binding Memorandum of Understanding signed with
      Concentric in May arranged for Sattel to "supply its DataNet product" to
      CNC 21 new SuperPOP sites.
      <P>
      However, ROGUE has not been able to confirm that this is the case. The amended
      S3 filing of October 21st details the limited sales history of the product.
      "Sattel did not have any sales of the DataNet product for the twelve months
      ended March 30, 1996 and the first quarter of fiscal 1997." But it indicates
      that Sattel has provided Concentric "with an option to purchase Datanet
      capability in the future."
      <P>
      Talks with Fiedler and Squeglia left the issue unsettled and Concentric's
      Laughlin would not detail the switch specifications, indicating she could
      only act as a reference for Sattel's comments. The presumption remains, however,
      that Concentric has purchased the DataNet product, at least for the latest
      round of switches to be delivered.
