                        <div class="entry-content">
                                                            <div class="entry-body">
                                 <p>There’s no reason to sugarcoat it.<br />
We took some stiff right hands in 2006.</p>

<p>The closings at places like Affinia and Steris and the layoffs at Bush Industries represent the loss of hundreds of manufacturing jobs for Erie, some with moderately good pay and others better than that.<br />
They’re not coming back.</p>

<p>It would be pretty easy these days to saddle up to the nearest bar stool, wax nostalgic about the days when there were more jobs than bodies to fill them and raise one last toast to the end of Erie. Then go look to see what openings are posted at Wal Mart. There is nothing on the horizon that will directly replace the millions of economic dollars lost in the last few years.</p>

<p>Still, if 2006 was the Year of Lost Expectations, 2007 is the Year to Expect Better.</p>

<p>Long awaited projects like the Bayfront Convention Center and Presque Isle Downs will come on line this year. Yes, these are retail and service jobs and even the ripple effect dollars (like conventioneers going to downtown bars and restaurants) are still not often family sustaining wages. <br />
But these projects are important because an interested business owner is going to want to know what a town has going for it before pulling the trigger on a move.</p>

<p>Consider these two scenarios when an out-of-town boss asks if anyone knows anything about Erie, PA:</p>

<p>1. “Hey boss, I went to a convention there last year. They have shuttle boats to a peninsula with all these beaches, nice little downtown places to go. The people were great. I had a blast.”<br />
2. Yea, I had to make a sales stop there. Went into this little bar and there were a bunch of guys in little blue vests with yellow smiley faces. They said the place bites and there’s too much snow.</p>

<p>Which one would you think would make an owner want to uproot his company? So there is value in entertainment and cultural projects beyond individual paychecks.</p>

<p>A 53 million-dollar biofuels plant should also open in 2007. There is great upside for emerging technology that will reduce reliance on foreign oil while using abundant crops like corn to stretch gasoline reserves.<br />
Consider the Missouri couple who looked all over the country before moving to Fairview to open a business that uses electronics to adapt diesel engines for better fuel performance and the upcoming biofuel formulas. </p>

<p>Besides the biofuel plant, the former IP property is also home for 70 acres of reclaimed brownfield that used to be Hammermill’s south yard. That property should be marketable in 2007. No, it’s not the same as having an existing plant on the site, but since the company left anyway it’s good to see the property cleaned up for reuse. What good is attracting a business if there’s no place to put it?</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the joint effort between private Erie investors and the Erie Airport to take control of a former Soviet air base outside Berlin, Germany. It’s hoped that the deal will be finalized in February. Creating a direct air link between Erie, PA and Cottbus, Germany creates easy access away from big cities to move cargo from the middle of America to Central Europe. If all goes as planned, that means jobs for truck drivers, jitney operators, warehouse supervisors and logistics staff.  Those are real jobs.<br />
Some companies may even want to open operations near the airport to be near the truck, rail and air opportunities.<br />
Hey, if we aren’t going to be making as much stuff as we used to, we better get better at moving it around.</p>

<p>Okay, your backside may be getting a bit warm from all the sunshine I’m shooting up your skirts. But, look, there are only two options when you get hit in the face. You can stay down on the mat or you can get up and fight. Nobody’s going to do it for us.  <br />

                        <div class="entry-content">
                                                            <div class="entry-body">
                                 <p>What follows is a cautionary tale of the human price paid for the technology that brings the world to our fingertips.</p>

<p>It’s easy to blame corporate greed for the empty hallways where workers once tread even as it is naive to think that it doesn’t exist. But greed doesn’t fully explain what the rise of the machines is costing us, even as they make our lives better.</p>

<p>This week’s case in point is Captain Dan Geary and Allan Carpenter, the former morning show hosts for Froggy FM 94.7 in Erie.In a shake up that rippled across the Erie radio spectrum, the Froggy oldies format is being moved to the AM side at Flagship 1330 and will be automated, run less expensively by computer without DJ talk.</p>

<p>The 94.7 slot has become BOB FM, a Best of Best format that addresses listeners’ complaints of repetitive play lists by playing hit songs across a number of musical tastes.</p>

<p>Station management hasn’t announced if BOB will have live DJ’s, but it seems unlikely that an oldies duo, regardless of their local popularity in that age group, will be retained for the new format.</p>

<p>Downsizing is nothing new in business, especially for those companies faced with new and real competition.</p>

<p>Technology can be blamed in this case too, as emerging products like I-pods and satellite radio systems threaten to steal ears traditionally owned by local radio broadcasters.</p>

<p>I hope for the best for Dan and Allan. They’re professional at what they do and good guys to boot. If they are forced to join millions of other Americans who have had to make sharp career turns, I’m sure things will go okay. </p>

<p>My hope is that these companies will realize that as syndication and automation and new technologies take over that the real niche Erie stations have is Erie itself. That means local people talking about local things that can’t be found on a satellite or national show. <br />
That means finding a way to make that model profitable in the face of all the bells and whistles that are out there.</p>

<p>The long term concern is that what makes us a community is more than geography. It is common experience.Ball teams and landmarks and media icons are all common threads that bind us as Erieites and separate us from members of other places.  </p>

<p>The technology that reduces those images, the same technology that keeps our eyes on cell phones and blackberries and our fills our ears with MP3 earphones at the expense of basic human conversation threatens more than our listening experience even with the great enhancemnts it has added to our lives. </p>

<p>It threatens our connection to each other, the very fabric of who we are.</p>

<p><strong>HEY!</strong> One of my New Year's resolutions is to see the day when the comments section will be fully restored on this site. Today is not that day.

<p><strong>COMMENTS</strong></p>

<p>Scott. I read your blog today and you did a good job in explaining the good and problems that technology brings. <br />
 This is a local problem as it causes us to lose our local identify and advance as we should with the rest of the country. We are being pulled backward for the sake of profit. Nothing wrong with profit. It's just that some profit was usually poured back into facilities to keep them current.<br />
 Again., very good thoughts.</p>

                                 <p>Like many in America (sans yours truly), my family had Monday off as the nation remembered the contribution to civil rights made by the late Dr. Martin Luther King.</p>

<p>Like many in America (this time including yours truly), my family has become addicted to video games.</p>

<p>For me, it’s the thrill of riding an x-wing in space or taking on a group of virtual monsters from the safety of my chair. For my wife and children, it’s the thrill of cleaning out a sink, taking a shower or answering a doorbell when it rings.</p>

<p>I just don’t get the allure of raising a Sims family.</p>

<p>Sims is the virtual reality game (short for “simulated persons” I assume) whereby players take complete charge of an invented person’s life or even the lives of an entire invented family.</p>

<p>That means getting up, going to the bathroom, and deciding what to wear every morning. That means eating and then cleaning up, building walls and floors of a home and decorating them by buying things from the store. It means not leaving the stove unattended or a fire will start; it means not leaving food out or it will turn green and stinky. In short, it means taking care of all of the mundane things for a cyber-family that we have to do every day to keep our real families going.</p>

<p>The reason why I play video games is to be taken somewhere else, someplace that I can’t experience in my world. I’ll never land a space fighter in the hostile hangar of a battle cruiser and come out blasting. But if I want to clean the bath tub, the Pine Sol is under the sink.</p>

<p>As I covered the march and memorial on Monday, my wife and kids spent their holiday building a new virtual family. There was a Dad called Scott who looked nothing like me, and a Mom named Diane who looked nothing like my wife, but wouldn’t you know shared the same name. </p>

<p>At last look the Sims Bremners were getting along pretty well. Of course, they haven’t had to wrestle yet over who gets to use the game controller like the real Bremners do.</p>

                                 <p>One of the truest indications of the staying power of a legacy is watching a life full of misdeeds rise to the heights of becoming part of the English language.</p>

<p>So it is with ill-fated developer Herb Fiss, who once dreamed of bringing an apple juice plant to Erie.</p>

<p>He believed it right to his core. </p>

<p>Local development people believed too, so much so that Fiss received the business end of half a million dollars in development grants. But the money left town when Fiss did amid revelations that other communities also dreamed Herb’s juice dream only to see those plans dry up.</p>

<p>Fiss died without ever repaying the money, forever creating a new verb among the local movers and shakers:</p>

<p>We really got Fissed on that one.</p>

<p>Local golf pro Dan Steen watched his Practice Tee driving range get literally yanked out from under him as the community made room for the juice-plant-that-wasn’t. The range was closed right in the middle of Steen’s busy summer season despite the fact that construction would have been months off even if the deal was real.<br />
Which it wasn’t.</p>

<p>Seems he really got Fissed, too.</p>

<p>The legacy even reaches all the way to the media. Local economic developers received a pretty public black eye with the deal now known as the Fiss Fiasco. Those developers prefer to keep projects on the down low until all the I’s and T’s are cared for, and for exactly this very reason.</p>

<p>But political figures get into the mix at some point, and in this case it was Governor Ed Rendell who let the cat out of the juice bag before the deal was in place. That put pressure on local people to make it happen and perhaps not all due diligence was taken as a result. </p>

<p>So now those developers are now even more tight-lipped about any plans for Erie’s future for fear of facing another Fiss job.<br />
Now it’s even harder for the media to tell the community about what plans are brewing, in essence double Fissing us for the developers’ previous Fissing episode.</p>

<p>Or something like that.</p>

<p><strong>HEY!</strong> Don't feel Fissed about this, but the comments section is still down. If you feel juiced enough to comment, drop me a line at scott.bremner@35wsee.com. Write "Comments" in the subject line so I don't Fiss it up, and I'll post your thoughts (if they're not too juicy).</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>I guess after the fi(SS)asco over the juice plant, the local politicians decided to try a Magic Trick to pull something out of their collective hats.  How about that donation of 25,000 to some character to start a magic museum?  Don't these people ever learn?  It's almost like they expect us to believe that we really will benefit from these ridiculous ventures, like the cruise boat terminal, the TREC, and the convention center, not to mention the Tullio Arena and Jerry Uht Park, which have yet to turn a profit for the investment by Erie County taxpayers.  Now they want us to believe in magic!!!!!!  No wonder they try to keep things under wraps til it's too late to stop the proceedings.</p>

<p>  Isn't rick fillippi (no capitols letters, please) sueing the city for legal fees in excess of $300,000? And didn't fiss stick us for over $300,000 apple-juice-junk bonds? Poetic justice would be for the city to sign over fiss's IOU to his pal, the former, nearly disgraced mayor. Maybe Governor Rendell will co-sign the note, since he endorsed fiss to begin with. Or did he clear that debt by bringing the Bleach Boy(s) to Celebrate Erie? Oh well, better than a bag of magic beans, I guess.</p>

Hey, I think a  magic museum is a great idea, I just don't want to pay for it--------unless the magician can increase my income to do so.                <br />

                                 <p>It was one of those nagging little fears and you just know that it had to happen sometime.</p>

<p>I was in a hurry, so I started my Jeep, flicked on the lights, the defroster and the heater. I grabbed my snowbrush and in a single motion jumped out of the snow covered vehicle and swung shut the door, which quickly joined its three brothers in a unified “thunk.” </p>

<p>The blood that the wind was already draining from my face raced further inward as the realization of that sound settled in.</p>

<p>The snowbrush had accidentally hit the lock button as I left my already running car.</p>

<p>The fact that you recognize that story and share that fear proves that you, too, spend this part of the year buried in the white stuff.</p>

<p>Like me, you know what it’s like to strain your neck while behind the wheel keeping a lock on those two rosy pink glows in front of you.</p>

<p>Like me, you know what it feels like to have your face frozen solid but your body covered in sweat after a spirited hour of shoveling.</p>

<p>You know the difference between walking on your toes across ice in your dress shoes and walking on your heels through slush to keep the muck off your socks.</p>

<p>You know the feeling of satisfaction at looking at a perfectly cleared driveway, and you know the pang of rage when the plow goes by to close you in all over again.</p>

<p>Like me, you realize the need for sunglasses on a winter afternoon.</p>

<p>You’ve marveled at the unparalleled beauty of tall, snow covered pine trees.</p>

<p>You’ve felt that the closest we may ever come to Peace on Earth is a windless, softly snowing night.</p>

<p>You’ve heard the squeals of delight from children sledding on a hill; you’ve heard the grousing of drivers who spend 45 minutes on what should be a 10 minute trip.</p>

<p>Like me, you are snowbound; bound by the beauty as well as the inconvenience.</p>

<p>To live here is to have it no other way.</p>

<p><strong>HEY!</strong> The comments here are still frozen, and that's no snow job. If you want to share your thoughts, even if they're icy, write to me at scott.bremner@35wsee.com and write "Comments" in the subject line so that I don't miss it. No muss, no slush.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p>I definitely share a lot of your experiences, but especially the feeling of being bound to the beauty of winter.  I really do love winter.  But I just have one quick comment on one of the experiences you mentioned.<br />

I've been in many white-outs, too.  But I never could understand why people trust the car in front of them to be able to see where they are going.  If you're concentrating on following that faint rosy glow of the tail lights in front of you, you could be following them right off the road, or worse, right into an oncoming car.  <br />
 <br />
Last week during the huge storm that shut down I90, I was driving on I79 (it was just as bad) and getting off in Edinboro.  The line of cars getting off in Edinboro was backed up along the entire exit ramp.  It took forever to get onto 6N due to zero visibility.  I noticed that many of the cars were not getting off on 6N, and instead were going straight and getting right back on to the interstate.  I'm pretty sure  they were simply following the faint rosy glow of the tail lights in front of them and not realizing they were exiting.  <br />
 <br />
Blind faith in leadership is never a good thing!  <br />

 I really enjoy reading your articles, and I am sure that many others would also if they were available in the Erie Times News (print edition). Any chance of that in the future?</p>

<p>Keep up the great work.</p>

   That really hasn't been discussed, but thanks for the good thoughts.</p>
