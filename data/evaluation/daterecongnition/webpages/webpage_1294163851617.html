The chief executives of G.M., <a href="http://www.my3cents.com/companyOverview.cgi?code=69" class=review_link>Ford</a> and <a href="http://www.my3cents.com/companyOverview.cgi?code=67" class=review_link>Chrysler</a> have been lobbying hard in Washington for at least $25 billion in addition to the $25 billion that the government has already lent them.  I understand that Congressional leaders expressed some support but have not made specific promises.  
<BR>
<BR>Please urge your senators and representatives not to give more taxpayer money to automakers who are failing because they cannot compete.

<div class="review" id="reviewId2">
  Long before this recession, Detroit automakers were loosing market share to <a href="http://www.my3cents.com/companyOverview.cgi?code=348" class=review_link>Toyota</a>, <a href="http://www.my3cents.com/companyOverview.cgi?code=71" class=review_link>Honda</a>, <a href="http://www.my3cents.com/companyOverview.cgi?code=79" class=review_link>Nissan</a>, <a href="http://www.my3cents.com/companyOverview.cgi?code=588" class=review_link>Hyundai</a> and <a href="http://www.my3cents.com/companyOverview.cgi?code=81" class=review_link>Volkswagen</a>.  Detroitâ€™s overly-generous union contracts and failure to produce efficient well-made automobiles has contributed more to their demise than the bad economy.  The recession is also hurting Asian and European automakers, but their governments are not bailing them out.  Why should we?

They were saying if GM were to go under, that would cost the government nearly 100 billion due to pension obligations and loss of people paying income taxes and instead receiving government benefits.  GM has 177,000 U.S. workers and around 500,000 people receiving pensions.

IF you add up all the auto workers, parts workers, dealership workers,repair workers, and shareholders, you are talking millions of jobs at risk and a million retirees losing half of their pensions,which would send the economy into a depression.

I say bail them out, but make very strict provisions for them to follow. No bonuses for top executives, bi-annual audits, and even so far as removing the current CEO with a government approved one.

We also need to watch the end of the year to see if Wall Street gets there huge bonuses that they give.

PEOPLE ARE NOT BUYING CARS and when the bailout money runs out, we will be at square one AGAIN. This money should be used ONLY for subsidizing a vehicles initial price and the finance rates (causing both to go much lower) making cars a less risky option to today's cautious (non car-buying) consumer.
