                              <p><strong>Now Available on Ships, in Stores and Online </strong></p><p>Holland America Line guests can now enjoy A Taste of Excellence long after their cruise has ended. Holland America Line's Master Chef Rudi Sodamin has written a new cookbook featuring nearly a hundred favorite recipes, complete with full-color photographs that instantly bring back memories of the wonderful on-board dining experience.</p><p>&quot;A Taste of Excellence is a wonderful complement to the exquisite culinary experience on our ships,&quot; said Stein Kruse, Holland America Line president and chief executive officer. &quot;The stunning photography replicates our innovative presentation of the dishes. With this book, our guests will be able to re- create their favorite ship-board dishes and share them with families and friends as they relive the marvelous dining experiences on their cruise.&quot;</p><p>Recipes, which have been modified for home preparation, cover everything from breakfast to late-night snacks. The 14 chapters include: Morning Meals, Breads &amp; Quick Breads; Appetizers; Soup; Salads &amp; Dressings; Pasta &amp; Risotto; Fish &amp; Shellfish; Poultry; Beef, Lamb, Veal, &amp; Venison; Vegetarian Fare; Side Dishes; Desserts &amp; Other Sweet Treats; Pantry Staples; and Sandwiches and Late-Night Snacks. To name but a few of the superb recipes included in this 208-page, hardcover keepsake cookbook:</p><p>* Dutch Apple Pancakes with Maple-Flavored Honey</p><p>* Apricot Glazed Salmon with Soy, Garlic and Ginger and Baby</p><p>Vegetables</p><p>* Dungeness Crab Cakes with Lime Ginger Sauce</p><p>* Rack of Veal with Roasted Vegetables and Thyme Glaze</p><p>* Parmesan-Crusted Turkey Tenderloin with Honey Mustard Sauce</p><p>* Wild Mushroom, Spinach, and Feta Cheese Strudel with Thai Red Curry</p><p>Sauce</p><p>* Chef Rudi's Famous White Chocolate Toque, Filled with Silky</p><p>Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse.</p><p>Expert Tips</p><p>In addition to the superb recipes in A Taste of Excellence, the book features culinary tips from Holland America Line's own executive chefs -- everything from how to garnish an appetizer, to how to tell when fish is cooked, to how to easily skin and seed tomatoes.</p><p>Executive Chef Thomas Krieger, for example, explains: &quot;Fish is cooked when the flesh has turned from translucent to opaque and springs back lightly when touched. The flesh should still be juicy. If you wait until the 'fish flakes easily with a fork,' as some recipes mistakenly suggest, your fish will be overcooked.&quot;</p><p>Galley Brigade</p><p>The cookbook also provides a look behind the scenes at the galleys on Holland America Line vessels. &quot;Most of our guests suspect that there must be an army of chefs behind the bounty of extraordinary cuisine we offer during a cruise,&quot; Sodamin says in a section of the book called A View from the Galley. &quot;In fact, there is a veritable army chopping, stewing, and firing up the saut&eacute; pans; on a ship the military term 'brigade' is used to describe the working culinary team.&quot;</p><p>&quot;At Holland America Line,&quot; Sodamin continued, &quot;being a member of the culinary team is especially rewarding because as a company with such a long history, our foundation is in classical cooking technique; however, we have a profound respect for inventiveness. We continually encourage members of our culinary team to experiment, expand their training and horizons, and create an effective interchange of old and new culinary ideas to bring our guests unforgettable dishes that they could experience nowhere else but aboard our ships.&quot;</p><p>Culinary Innovations</p><p>This book is just the latest culinary innovation created by Holland America Line. Guests are filling the Culinary Arts Center to learn new cooking skills; every cruise offers guests the opportunity for small-group cooking lessons and a variety of food and wine demonstrations. The alternative dining venue, the Pinnacle Grill, provides a gracious and memorable culinary experience. Holland America Line also has introduced a clever and entertaining Signature Master Chef's Dinner, a new concept in dinner theater, featuring singing, dancing, juggling and more.</p><p>The list of culinary delights goes on. New wine lists, with an international selection of wines, have been introduced throughout the fleet. Gold Rush Baked Alaska is the star of the desert menu on Alaska cruises this season, with the traditional desert served with different toppings each of the seven nights of a cruise. And, &quot;Going Wild for Salmon,&quot; introduced on Alaska cruises in 2005 and featuring salmon fixed 50 different ways, has been expanded this year to include Baltic cruises.</p><p>&quot;A key element in our success in bringing our guests the finest cuisine the maritime world has to offer is our partnership with Rudi Sodamin -- the most highly decorated and celebrated master chef on the seven seas,&quot; Kruse said. &quot;He is widely known for revolutionizing cuisine on cruise lines; his innovation and creativity have set the standard for our entire industry.&quot;</p><p>Sodamin notes that with the new cookbook and the demonstrations and classes offered in the Culinary Arts Center &quot;guests leave our cruises not only with a memory of great meals, but equipped with the knowledge of how to re- create them at home.&quot; The cookbook also will introduce cruisers-to-be to the delights of fine dining at sea.</p><p>A Taste of Excellence Cookbook is available for $29.95 (US) or $39.95 (Canadian) on all Holland America Line ships. It also may be purchased at major bookstores such as Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders, and on line through Amazon.com.</p><p>For more information on Holland America Line consult a professional travel agent, call 1-877-SAIL-HAL (877-724-5425) or visit www.hollandamerica.com.</p><p>- www.hollandamerica.com -</p><p>About Holland America Line [a division of Carnival Corporation and plc (<a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&amp;PageName=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=CCL"><u>NYSE:CCL</u></a>) (<a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&amp;PageName=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=and"><u>NYSE:and</u></a>) (<a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&amp;PageName=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=CUK"><u>NYSE:CUK</u></a>) ]</p><p>With the introduction of the 1,918-passenger ms Noordam in early 2006, Holland America Line's fleet grows to 13 ships, offering nearly 500 cruises from more than 25 home ports.

                              <strong><p></p></strong><strong><p>Smaller and Privately Held Companies Are at Risk </p></strong><p>&nbsp;A significant majority of global corporations currently have either a detailed avian flu pandemic readiness plan in place or are in the process of developing a plan, according to a report released today by The Conference Board, the global research and business membership organization which is celebrating its 90th anniversary this year.</p><p>Nearly three-fourths of the 553 responding global companies (including companies of all sizes from all world regions except the Middle East) either have a plan or are well into developing one, and 85 percent of the survey participants began their planning efforts within the last 12 months.</p><p>&quot;As concern about the possibility of an avian flu pandemic becomes increasingly widespread across the globe, a large number of companies are taking steps toward adopting a risk mitigation strategy,&quot; says Amy Kao, co- author of the report from The Conference Board with David J. Vidal, Research Director, Global Corporate Citizenship, The Conference Board. Vidal says: &quot;But the effectiveness of business plans and the quality of relationships necessary for their successful implementation in times of extreme public, private and social stress remains open to question.&quot;</p><p>NOT A PRIORITY IN SOME FIRMS</p><p>Of the one quarter or so responding companies without a specific avian flu pandemic preparedness strategy, about half of them simply do not see such planning as a current business priority; while 20% feel that their existing business continuity plan is adequate to manage the threat.</p><p>&quot;Small and privately held companies represent the majority of those without an avian flu plan and are therefore the organizations most vulnerable to the risks of a pandemic,&quot; say Kao and Vidal.</p><p>Large and publicly held companies appear to be the most advanced in their preparations for a possible avian flu pandemic. Approximately 95% of companies with more than $5 billion in sales either have an up-to-date preparedness plan or are in the process of planning. But, 65% of companies with less than $100 million do not yet have any plans specifically in place addressing the impact of an influenza pandemic.</p><p>&quot;The variability of business responsiveness to planning alone-with large companies more willing and able to do so than smaller companies-underscores vulnerability in the current state of pandemic readiness planning,&quot; says Vidal. &quot;Given that successful pandemic containment would require extraordinary levels of business, social, governmental and individual awareness, knowledge, and cooperation, these gaps provide reason for pause.&quot;</p><p>According to The Conference Board report, the most significant disadvantage in not conducting formal pandemic preparedness planning may be the virtually total absence of coordination with the public sector. An overwhelming 94% of participating companies report that they have not had discussions with any level of government officials about their organization's ability to provide essential services or access to facilities, equipment, or staff during a pandemic.</p><p>In addition, the gap in readiness efforts is significantly felt between those companies in critical industries and non-critical industries. A critical industry is defined as those designated by government as vital to national economic continuity in a crisis. Companies in the healthcare, energy/utilities, chemical manufacturing, and computer/technology manufacturing industries ranked at the top for either having a plan in place or being in the process of planning. Health care and computer/technology manufacturing industries are farther along in their planning efforts, with 30% of those in both industries having a complete plan ready in the event of a pandemic.</p><p>Since most companies surveyed began pandemic preparation planning in the last 12 months, survey results showed companies in all phases of planning, from those with a completed pandemic preparedness plan (12%) to those in an embryonic stage of having identified a pandemic coordinator but not yet beginning the planning process (13%). However, the majority fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, either in the process of updating a plan that is already in place or assessing the impact of a pandemic prior to drafting a plan.</p><p>LEADING CONCERNS OF TOP MANAGERS</p><p>In the event of a pandemic, companies are most concerned about the health and welfare of employees (98%), operational continuity (96%), and their telecommuting capabilities to enable employees to work from home (93%).</p><p>Identifying critical positions within an organization constitutes a basic first step toward minimizing business disruptions. A third of companies have completed the task; just under half are in the process of identifying critical positions, and the remaining 20% have not yet begun the process but plan to do so in the future. Survey findings indicate that a median of 37% of the total workforce within an organization are considered critical for operational continuity. In anticipation of high absenteeism, more than two-thirds of companies plan to continue to depend upon their existing workforce to maintain normal business operations by cross-training employees to be skilled in multiple jobs. Two-thirds of survey participants don't know whether employees who are asked to cover for absentees will be offered additional compensation.</p><p>Some companies plan to gather additional human resources by pooling with other organizations (34%) and contracting retired workers to come back to work temporarily to ensure that critical positions are filled (25%).</p><p>Most companies are expected to rely on IT technologies so employees will be able to continue to work away from the workplace. Seventy percent are currently enhancing existing capabilities to allow employees to work from home or from a satellite facility during a pandemic. Firms say that they intend to use emails (82%), intranets (76%), management briefings (58%) and crisis hotlines (57%), when given a choice of which methods of employee communications they plan to use.</p><p>&quot;While telecommuting may alleviate some business disruption, the downstream effects stemming from supply chain disruption will likely remain significant,&quot; says Kao. &quot;In fact, about half of survey participants predict that impact from delivery and supply chain disruptions will be very serious or extremely serious.&quot;</p><p>There doesn't seem to be a strong consensus on any specific criterion that would activate an organization's pandemic preparedness plan. Close to one- third of the survey participants report that their plan will be activated when the World Health Organization (WHO) declares Alert Level 4 (increased human- to-human transmission). Eighteen percent said that their plan would go into effect when a pandemic situation is declared in a country where their organization has operating presence; while 15% simply don't know.</p><p>Almost 30% of those surveyed say they do not know whether their organization's board of directors has had any discussion about the planning for a pandemic. Ten percent say that their board has adopted a formal policy for pandemic planning; 22% say that the board has discussed planning but hasn't adopted a formal policy; 14% say that board is scheduled to discuss pandemic planning; and 21% say that their board has no plans yet.</p><p>For the time being, most companies are shunning direct healthcare intervention with regard to the avian flu. Three-fourths of the survey participants report that their organization has no plans to stockpile antiretroviral drugs, such as Tamiflu. Just over 10% indicate that they have already acquired inventories of antiretroviral drugs in anticipation of a pandemic, and an additional 15% plan to do so in the future. Almost all companies cite employee education as a critical part of their pandemic response efforts and include regular communication about the impact of influenza viruses on health and work performance as a preventative measure in their plans.</p><p>Source: Executive Action #204: Are Businesses Doing Enough to Prepare for</p><p>a Pandemic?, The Conference Board</p><p>For more information on avian flu preparedness visit:</p><p><a href="http://www.conference-board.org/knowledge/resources/resource_avianFlu.cfm"><u>http://www.conference-board.org/knowledge/resources/resource_avianFlu.cfm</u></a></p><p>About The Conference Board</p><p>Non-partisan and not-for-profit, The Conference Board is one of the world's leading business membership and research organizations.

                              <strong><p>After rising for three consecutive weeks, fixed mortgage rates took a breather in the immediate aftermath of the Federal Reserve's June 29th interest rate hike. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage slid to 6.91 percent from 6.93 percent the day before last week's Fed announcement. According to Bankrate.com's weekly national survey of large lenders, the 30-year fixed rate mortgages had an average of 0.31 discount and origination points.</p></strong>After rising for three consecutive weeks, fixed mortgage rates took a breather in the immediate aftermath of the Federal Reserve's June 29th interest rate hike. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage slid to 6.91 percent from 6.93 percent the day before last week's Fed announcement. According to Bankrate.com's weekly national survey of large lenders, the 30-year fixed rate mortgages had an average of 0.31 discount and origination points.<p>The average 15-year fixed rate mortgage popular for refinancing sank to 6.54 percent. On larger loans, the average jumbo 30-year fixed rate remains above the 7 percent threshold, at 7.06 percent. Adjustable rate mortgages were mixed. The average 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage fell to 6.55 percent, and the average one-year ARM increased to 6.11 percent.</p><p>Mortgage rates backpedaled following the Fed's June 29 statement, which was initially perceived as carrying a much softer tone than in previous months. As a result, yields on ten-year Treasury notes gave ground, with mortgage rates following suit. Mortgage rates are closely related to yields on long-term government bonds. But following the July 4 holiday, rates perked up on a rosy prediction of June job growth, though not enough to erase the decline late last week. Over the next couple of weeks, any combination of strong job growth and continued inflation worries will prime the pump or an August Fed hike -- and push mortgage rates higher.</p><p>Fixed mortgage rates moved up notably in the first half of the year. As 2005 came to a close, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.28 percent, meaning that the monthly payment on a loan of $165,000 was $1,019.16. With the average 30-year fixed rate now 6.91 percent, the same loan originated today would carry a payment of $1,087.79. Despite recent increases, fixed mortgage rates remain an attractive refinancing alternative for adjustable rate borrowers facing sharp payment adjustments.</p><p>SURVEY RESULTS</p><p>30-year fixed: 6.91% -- down from 6.93% last week (avg. points: 0.31)</p><p>15-year fixed: 6.54% -- down from 6.57% last week (avg. points: 0.3)</p><p>5/1 ARM: 6.55% -- down from 6.59% last week (avg. points: 0.32)</p><p>Bankrate's national weekly mortgage survey is conducted each Wednesday from data provided by the top 10 banks and thrifts in the top 10 markets.</p><p>For a full analysis of this week's move in mortgage rates, go to <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/mortgagerates"><u>http://www.bankrate.com/mortgagerates</u></a> </p><p>The survey is complemented by Bankrate's weekly forward-looking Rate Trend Index, in which a panel of mortgage experts predicts which way the rates are headed over the next 30 to 45 days. This week, respondents overwhelmingly expect mortgage rates to keep rising, with 84 percent in that camp. The remaining 16 percent forecast that rates will remain unchanged in the next 30 to 45 days. Interestingly, no one predicts mortgage rates to fall during that time.</p><p>For the full mortgage Rate Trend Index, go to <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/RTI"><u>http://www.bankrate.com/RTI</u></a></p><p>About Bankrate, Inc.</p><p>Bankrate, Inc.

There will be a news conference at 10:30 a.m. Since its launch in April 2005, the program -- sponsored by America's pharmaceutical research companies working with doctors, pharmacists, health care providers and community groups -- has matched nearly 2.5 million patients nationally, and more than 140,000 right here in Tennessee.</p><p>&quot;The Partnership for Prescription Assistance is changing thousands of lives every day,&quot; said Karen Katen, Vice Chairman of Pfizer Inc and President, Pfizer Human Health. &quot;No one is helped by a medicine that sits on the shelf and is out of reach financially. The Partnership for Prescription Assistance is matching the people of Tennessee who are uninsured or underinsured to patient assistance programs that may help them get the medicines they need for free or nearly free. We will keep coming back to Tennessee as long as there are people who need affordable access to our medicines.&quot;</p><p>Through its toll-free number (1-888-4PPA-NOW) and user-friendly website (<a href="http://www.pparx.org/"><u>http://www.pparx.org/</u></a>), the Partnership for Prescription Assistance is the only program that provides a single point of access to more than 475 public and private patient assistance programs, including more than 180 programs offered by pharmaceutical companies. The &quot;Help is Here Express&quot; is equipped with computer terminals and phones to make it easy for patients to learn about the assistance programs on-site.</p><p>&quot;Millions of patients are already receiving free or nearly free drugs from these programs, but it is clear that millions of other Americans from all over the country -- in cities and rural areas alike -- are not taking advantage of the help that is available to them,&quot; said Williams, who regularly addresses critically important societal issues on his show.</p><p>&quot;The PPA is a concerted and effective effort to reach those who still need help. I'm going to do everything I can to get the word out. As a patient who must cope every day with the effects of multiple sclerosis, I understand only too well the importance of having access to the medicine you need,&quot; said Williams.</p><p>More than 70 national groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, Easter Seals, National Alliance for Hispanic Health, National Urban League, United Way of America, as well as a fast-growing list of state and local organizations, are working with America's pharmaceutical companies and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) to spread the word about the program.</p><p>&quot;NAMI Memphis is excited about the Partnership for Prescription Assistance program and the help it offers to the millions of people who cannot afford their prescription medicines,&quot; said Brad Cobb, executive director of the Memphis branch of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. &quot;I encourage anyone who is having trouble paying for their medicines to call the toll-free number and find out if you may qualify for one of the hundreds of assistance programs offered by the Partnership for Prescription Assistance.&quot;</p><p>To find out if there are patient assistance programs that may meet their needs, patients should call toll-free 1-888-4PPA-NOW (1-888-477-2669) to speak with a trained specialist or visit <a href="http://www.pparx.org/"><u>http://www.pparx.org/</u></a>.</p><p>Call today 1-888-4PPA-NOW (1-888-477-2669) or visit <a href="http://www.pparx.org/"><u>http://www.pparx.org/</u></a>. </p><p>Source: Partnership for Prescription Assistance </p><p>Web site: <a href="http://www.pparx.org/"><u>http://www.pparx.org/</u></a> </p>

                              <strong><p>&nbsp;Hello Friend/Ennis William Cosby Foundation is putting into action a simple and inexpensive tool that addresses head on the specific challenges that face middle school students.

Most educators agree that high school outcomes are determined in middle school, where students either learn or fail to learn the skills which are necessary for high school completion.</p></strong>&nbsp;Hello Friend/Ennis William Cosby Foundation is putting into action a simple and inexpensive tool that addresses head on the specific challenges that face middle school students. Middle school (grades 6-8) represent a &quot;make or break&quot; time for our nation's schoolchildren. Most educators agree that high school outcomes are determined in middle school, where students either learn or fail to learn the skills which are necessary for high school completion.<p>The Foundation's education director, Carolyn Olivier, developed and wrote Hello Friend/What's Up?, an innovative daily student planner that helps students stay on top of their work, complete assignments, manage their projects and apply essential learning skills that will benefit them for the rest of their lives. Ms. Olivier, the Harvard-educated co-author of a highly regarded parental guidebook to education called Learning to Learn (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996) designed this resource to help schools and families work together more efficiently to support each child's learning.</p><p>Hello Friend/What's Up? was put into practice in nearly 200 middle schools earlier this spring. Teachers using the planners commented that they experienced dramatic increases in both homework completion and direct parental involvement. One teacher in the New York City Schools wrote, &quot;Formerly less than half the assignments would come in every day. Now, over 80% of them are handed in.&quot; A teacher in Oklahoma shared, &quot;Parents loved having this planner for their children. This helped tremendously with parent/teacher communication. It can make a difference.&quot;</p><p>The results were so positive that the Foundation is making Hello Friend/What's Up? available this autumn to a wider distribution. &quot;Hello Friend/What's Up demonstrates that solutions do not have to be complicated, expensive and overwhelming,&quot; stated Joel Brokaw, executive director of the Foundation. &quot;Our mandate is to put proven techniques into the hands of teachers and parents so that each child has the resources and support to reach their learning potential.&quot;</p><p>The launch of the planner last January was made possible thanks to the support of Scholastic Book Clubs and a gift from the Waghorne family. The Foundation hopes to continue free distribution of the books this fall to underserved schools through individual and corporate funding of &quot;school adoptions&quot; and through profits from the sales. &quot;For as little as $6 per child, a donor will have a daily impact the entire school year and reinforce learning skills that have benefit for a lifetime,&quot; added Brokaw.</p><p>In another high impact program, Hello Friend has distributed more than three quarters of a million books, collated into &quot;classroom libraries&quot; to nearly eight thousand K-2 teachers in 533 cities and towns in 48 states over the last five years. Partners and sponsors for the project include Scholastic Book Clubs, Chase, Verizon, regional and local foundations, and a small army of volunteers from southeastern Vermont. &quot;Many of our nation's children attend classrooms where there are few books to read, where the books are out of date or damaged, or where budget cuts have closed the school library,&quot; Ms. Olivier explained. &quot;Many of these same children have few books at home. This project addresses the gap that exists in the opportunity to learn to read, and to learn to love reading.&quot; The Hello Friend Classroom Libraries, which consist of 75-95 brand new hard and softcover books, organized by grade level, arrive at no cost to teachers or schools.</p><p>The Hello Friend/Ennis William Cosby Foundation is dedicated to fulfilling the goals and dreams of Ennis Cosby, the son of Bill and Camille Cosby. The Foundation equips teachers, parents and students with the practical information and educational tools needed to understand and address the needs of all learners before they experience the corrosive effects of frustration and failure.

                              <strong><p></p></strong><strong><p>Also: Penthouse Interviews Busta Rhymes, Paul Giamatti and Mancow </p></strong><p>Have you ever pondered what your woman might be thinking about when you're in bed together? Have you ever imagined that perhaps she wants to be dominated, or participate in an orgy, or do both in some exotic locale? According to Penthouse's own Dr. Zdrok, women fantasize as much as men, if not more so and in this month's Vices &amp; Vanities column, Dr. Z reveals the TOP TEN SEXUAL FANTASIES of WOMEN. Be shocked, be stimulated and get educated. Going forward, you'll be more understanding and less upset if she happens to scream out her ex's name, or Brad Pitt's -- in bed.</p><p>SOUNDS -- Busta Move and Tool Time:</p><p>Busta Rhymes is returning to the forefront of hip-hop with a fresh look and a new album titled, The Big Bang. The album has taken three years to make and features cameos from several artists including: Missy Elliot, will.i.am and Nas, but not Eminem. &quot;When I do records with certain people who I respect and I'm a fan of, I want to treat it like an event. It got leaked that Em and I were coming together on I'll Hurt You, and it was all over the place before we could make an event out of it.&quot; So, is this Busta's best work yet? &quot;I possess an album that has things that no other album in existence has: a Rick James cameo, a Stevie Wonder cameo and a Dr. Dre cameo!&quot;</p><p>Five years ago, the band Tool warned of a future with political and personal strife. Now, the prog-metal men of mystery have returned, &quot;pissed off and lashing out,&quot; on their new album, 10,000 Days.</p><p>ENTERTAINMENT -- Mancow and Mr. Giamatti</p><p>Nationally syndicated radio deejay, Erich Muller (a.k.a. Mancow) feels he's bigger than Howard Stern and bolder than Opie and Anthony. &quot;Opie and Anthony are older than me. What they do is easy, voyeuristic radio. I think it's unsellable.&quot; A former ministry student, this Chicago mouthpiece combines sex and politics to create one of America's most popular shows, Mancow's Morning Madness. He thinks that 13-year-old girls probably have more experience at sex than him, regardless of being married with children, and he resents being labeled a &quot;shock jock.&quot; &quot;I'm not a shock jock. That is someone who says something simply for ratings and/or effect. I have never done that. The guy who went on the air and said we were under nuclear attack, the guy who said the president had been shot, and the guy who faked raping a Girl Scout ... that is a shock.&quot; While his job gets him in trouble on a daily basis at home, he is nonetheless an outspoken icon adored by fans, fanatics and family alike.</p><p>Paul Giamatti's father was the President of Yale University and one of the foremost scholars in Renaissance literature. So, how is it then that this leading character actor adores pulp fiction, Peckinpah Western's and B-horror movies? While he attends movie award shows and collects statues for his work, this thespian is secretly planning his escape back into the weird niche of brilliant character actor roles.</p><p>August Pet and Pennsylvania local, Olivia Kent is this month's centerfold. A resident of Hazelton, this blonde beauty has a leg up, make that a very long leg up, on the competition.</p><p>The August 2006 Penthouse issue is available at newsstands and at <a href="http://www.penthouse.com/digital"><u>http://www.penthouse.com/digital</u></a>, now.

                              <p>-- A seven week downward trend ended as consumer demand for gasoline pushed prices up across the Southland this week, according to the Automobile Club of Southern California's Weekend Gas Watch. </p><p>The average price of self-serve regular gasoline in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area is $3.253 which is 7.1 cents higher than last week, seven cents lower than last month and 77 cents higher than last year. In San Diego, the price is $3.260, 7.4 cents above last week's price, seven cents below last month and 73 cents above last year. On the Central Coast, the average price is $3.398, up 4.1 cents from last week, six cents below last month and 80 cents higher than last year. In the Inland Empire, the average price is $3.276, up seven cents from last week, eight cents below last month and 80 cents higher than last year. </p><p>&quot;When prices reached record highs in May motorists cut back driving considerably. Lower demand helped push prices lower,&quot; said Auto Club spokesperson Carol Thorp. &quot;But, declining prices and the start of summer resulted in higher demand for gas. That has put upward pressure on prices.&quot; </p><p>The Weekend Gas Watch monitors the average price of gasoline as of 12:01 a.m., July 7: </p><pre>Area                         Regular   Change from      Record Price                                         last week ----------------------       -------   -----------    ----------------- Los Angeles-Long Beach        $3.253    +7.1 cents    $3.402 (5/13/2006)  Orange County                 $3.222    +4.2 cents    $3.371 (5/17/2006)  San Diego                     $3.260    +7.4 cents    $3.438 (5/15/2006)  Santa Barbara-  Santa Maria-Lompoc           $3.398    +4.1 cents    $3.491 (5/16/2006)  Riverside-  San Bernardino               $3.276    +7.0 cents    $3.445 (5/15/2006)  Bakersfield                   $3.169    +2.7 cents    $3.450 (5/16/2006)  Las Vegas, NV                 $2.963    +1.8 cents    $3.176 (5/17/2006) </pre><table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0"><tbody></tbody></table>

Susanna&quot;), and Gaelic traditional folk airs (&quot;Hush Little Baby&quot;/&quot;My Bonnie,&quot; &quot;I Gave My Love a Cherry [The Riddle Song],&quot; &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;).</p><p>Carly rounds out the album with a pair of new self-penned compositions: &quot;Love of My Life,&quot; and &quot;Quiet Evening.&quot;</p><p>Produced by Carly Simon &amp; Jimmy Parr (who worked on Carly's seasonal collection, Christmas Is Almost Here), the songs on Into White are performed by a small intimate ensemble including Teese Gohl (who also arranged strings on the album) on keyboards, synths, kalimba and flute; Peter Calo on guitar and dobro; Jan Hyer on cello; David Saw on guitar; and Jimmy Parr on percussion, kalimba and heartbeat.</p><p>Sally Taylor and Ben Taylor (each an accomplished songwriter and performer in her/his own right) join their mother on a familial rendition of James Taylor's &quot;You Can Close Your Eyes,&quot; from 1971's Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon. Ben Taylor contributes vocals to several other songs on Into White including an enchanting new version of &quot;Devoted To You,&quot; the Everly Brothers classic Carly first covered in 1978 with then-husband and frequent singing partner James Taylor on her best-selling Boys In The Trees album.</p><p>In addition to her legendary status as one of America's definitive female singer/songwriters -- having penned such classic pop songs as &quot;You're So Vain,&quot; &quot;Anticipation,&quot; and &quot;Let The River Run&quot; -- Carly has also authored several award-winning children's books beginning with the best-seller &quot;Amy The Dancing Bear&quot; in 1989 and including &quot;The Boy of the Bells&quot; (1990), &quot;The Fisherman's Song&quot; (1990), &quot;Nighttime Chauffeur&quot; (1993), and &quot;Midnight Farm&quot; (1997).</p><p>From her sly version of &quot;Itsy Bitsy Spider&quot; in the soundtrack to Nora Ephron's &quot;Heartburn&quot; (1987) to her songs in the Disney Winnie the Pooh films, &quot;Piglet's Big Movie&quot; (2003) and &quot;Pooh's Heffalump Movie&quot; (2005), Carly Simon has shown an uncanny ability to connect with audiences of all ages.</p><p>Into White is executive produced by Jay Landers, who first worked with Carly on &quot;Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry&quot;/&quot;In The Wee Small Hours of the Morning,&quot; her duet with Frank Sinatra on Ol' Blue Eyes' 1993 Grammy winning Duets album. Landers -- who has supervised records with Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler, Celine Dion and many others -- provided musical supervision for numerous original cast recordings and soundtracks including &quot;Miss Saigon,&quot; &quot;Carousel,&quot; &quot;A League of Our Own,&quot; &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; and others. He has also worked on a number of children's recordings including Disney's Lullaby Album and the Grammy winning &quot;Woody's Roundup&quot; from Disney/Pixar's &quot;Toy Story 2.&quot;</p><p>Carly Simon - &quot;Into White&quot; - track listing</p><p>Oh!

                              <p>&nbsp;</p>The Neways Summer Concert Series is proud to present Mark Chesnutt, legendary performer and dedicated musician, in concert on July 7th at 8:30p.m. Back in the honky-tonks of Beaumont, Texas, he developed his raw talent and passion for genuine country music. His success is manifested in his 23 top-ten singles, four platinum albums, 14 No. 1 hits and five gold records. <p>With country music's changing environment, Mark remains true to his time-honored style and faithful fan base. &quot;I just make records because I want people to come see my show,&quot; he said. &quot;Just listening to the music is great, but I've got to be out there on stage making it.&quot; </p><p>As one of Billboard's top-ten most played radio artists, Mark Chesnutt has created top-selling hits such as &quot;Bubba Shot the Juke Box,&quot; &quot;I'll think of Something,&quot; and &quot;Goin' Through the Big D.&quot; When Mark was just 17 years old, he began traveling to Nashville with his father, Bob Chesnutt. After a decade of persistence, and as word spread concerning this talented boy from Texas, Mark eventually singed with MCA Nashville. Winning the CMA Horizon Award was one of his greatest accomplishments. </p><p>To see Mark live is quite the experience, since he developed a bona fide sound and crowd-pleasing flare alongside Lefty, Merle, George and Waylon.

                              <p>A recent report about antimicrobial use in food production, prepared for the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT), inaccurately depicts the use of antimicrobials in organic farming and processing. The Organic Trade Association has prepared these facts to set the record straight.<br /></p><p>&quot;Organic farmers and processors follow all federal state, and local health standards, and do so in ways that enhance the environment and the public health,&quot; said Caren Wilcox, executive director of the Organic Trade Association and former food safety official. </p><p>Because farmers using the organic system have to concentrate on prevention of disease and maintaining the good health of the animals, a healthy and clean environment is paramount on organic farms, and the health of the animals is overseen on at least a daily basis. Organic practices prohibit the use of hormones, antibiotics or other animal drugs in animal feed for the purpose of stimulating the growth or production of livestock. Meat sold as organic cannot come from an animal that received antibiotics.</p><p>For several years, respected organizations, such as the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization, have recommended against the sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in agriculture in order to protect the public health because they report that these uses contribute to development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. </p><p>Keeping food products, such as produce and grains, safe during growing and processing is important to organic producers. Use of antimicrobial processes and materials is allowed in organic farming and processing, and specific materials and processes used in organic production are regulated by law. Pasteurization (an antimicrobial), selected use of chlorine (an antimicrobial), hydrogen peroxide (and antimicrobial) and other food safety practices also are allowed and followed in organic production.</p><p>Very little data exists about how farming practices affect the potential for foodborne illness. What is known is that organic farmers produce healthful products without the use of toxic and persistent pesticides and fertilizers, sewage sludge, or genetically modified organisms, or growth hormones, which are all allowed in non-organic production. </p><p>The report does show that bacteria that may be present in organic meat and poultry are not as resistant to antibiotics as bacteria on non-organic meat. Therefore, the use of an allowed antimicrobial on organic meat is more likely to kill bacteria than the bacteria on meat from a non-organic food animal that has been exposed to antibiotics on the farm or in processing.</p><p>A study by Mukherjee et al, published in the Journal of Food Protection (Vo. 67, No. 5, 2004), found that the percentage of E. coli prevalence in certified organic produce was similar to that in conventional samples. However, it did find a marked difference in the prevalence of E. coli between the samples from certified and non-certified organic farms. &quot;Ours is the first study that suggests a potential association between organic certification and reduced E. coli prevalence,&quot; the authors wrote. They noted that the results of the study &quot;do not support allegations that organic produce poses a substantially greater risk of pathogen contamination than does conventional produce.&quot;</p><p>Regardless of the methods used to grow and process the food, cooks at home need to follow safe handling procedures&mdash; store foods at the proper temperature, keep meat and vegetables separate, wash hands and utensils after handling raw meats, wash produce before eating it, and cook meats to the proper temperature.</p><p>To learn more, <a href="http://www.ota.com/organic/foodsafety/antimicrobials.html">link to antimicrobial fact sheet</a>.<br /></p>

Once again we have JOHNNY DEPP starring in his Academy Award&reg;-nominated role, </p><p>ORLANDO BLOOM and 2005 Best Actress Oscar&reg; nominee KEIRA KNIGHTLEY. </p><p>Produced by JERRY BRUCKHEIMER and directed by GORE VERBINSKI, Captain Jack sets sail on this all-new adventure. In this swashbuckling and spectacular follow-up to the blockbuster 2003 film, the decidedly eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow is caught up in another tangled web of supernatural intrigue. Although the curse of the Black Pearl has been lifted, an even more terrifying threat looms over its captain and scurvy crew: it turns out that Jack owes a blood debt to the legendary Davy Jones (BILL NIGHY), Ruler of the Ocean Depths, who captains the ghostly Flying Dutchman, which no other ship can match in speed and stealth. Unless the ever-crafty Jack figures a cunning way out of this Faustian pact, he will be cursed to an afterlife of eternal servitude and damnation in the service of Jones. This startling development interrupts the wedding plans of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who once again find themselves thrust into Jack&rsquo;s misadventures, leading to escalating confrontations with sea monsters, very unfriendly islanders, flamboyant soothsayer </p><p>Tia Dalma (NAOMIE HARRIS) and even the mysterious appearance of Will&rsquo;s long-lost father, Bootstrap Bill (STELLAN SKARSG&Aring;RD). </p><p>Meanwhile, ruthless pirate hunter Lord Cutler Beckett (TOM HOLLANDER) of the East India Trading Company sets his sights on retrieving the fabled &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s Chest.&rdquo; According to legend, whoever possesses the Dead Man&rsquo;s Chest gains control of Davy Jones, and Beckett intends to use this awesome power to destroy every last Pirate of the Caribbean once and for all. For times are changing on the high seas, with businessmen and bureaucrats becoming the true pirates&hellip;and freewheeling, fun-loving buccaneers like Jack and his crew threatened with extinction. </p><p>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST is a fantastical epic adventure which, like its successful predecessor, will take audiences on the ride of their lives. The writers are TED ELLIOTT and TERRY ROSSIO, co-writers of the first film, who also have such hits on their resume as Aladdin&rdquo;and &ldquo;Shrek.&rdquo; The film&rsquo;s executive producers are MIKE STENSON, CHAD OMAN, BRUCE HENDRICKS and ERIC MCLEOD. </p><p>With his Academy Award&reg;- and Golden Globe&reg;-nominated and Screen Actors Guild Award&reg;-winning portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp instantaneously created an authentic motion picture icon embraced by the entire world. Depp is one of the world&rsquo;s most popular and acclaimed actors, with a hugely versatile range of performances marking his outstanding career. He has received Academy Award&reg; and Golden Globe&reg; nominations for both &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&rdquo; and 2004&rsquo;s &ldquo;Finding Neverland,&rdquo; in which he portrayed &ldquo;Peter Pan&rdquo; writer J.M. Barrie. Depp&rsquo;s extraordinary range of credits since the late 1980s have included &ldquo;Cry-Baby,&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Eating Gilbert Grape?,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ed Wood,&rdquo; &ldquo;Benny &amp; Joon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Edward Scissorhands,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don Juan DeMarco,&rdquo; &ldquo;Donnie Brasco,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sleepy Hollow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chocolat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Once Upon a Time in Mexico,&rdquo; &ldquo;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tim Burton&rsquo;s Corpse Bride.&rdquo; </p><p>Orlando Bloom became a major international star with his portrayal of Legolas in Peter Jackson&rsquo;s award-winning &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo; trilogy. Since then, the increasingly popular actor has starred in Jerry Bruckheimer&rsquo;s production of &ldquo;Black Hawk Down,&rdquo; directed by Ridley Scott, Wolfgang Petersen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Troy,&rdquo; Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo; and Cameron Crowe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elizabethtown.&rdquo; </p><p>Keira Knightley is the recipient of 2005 Academy Award&reg; and Golden Globe&reg; nominations as Best Actress for her starring role as Elizabeth Bennet in &ldquo;Pride &amp; Prejudice.&rdquo; She was first brought to the attention of international audiences in the sleeper hit &ldquo;Bend It Like Beckham.&rdquo; In addition to &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,&rdquo; she has also starred in &ldquo;Love, Actually,&rdquo; Jerry Bruckheimer&rsquo;s production of &ldquo;King Arthur,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Jacket&rdquo; and &ldquo;Domino.&rdquo; </p><p>With only five features to his credit thus far, Gore Verbinski&rsquo;s highly acclaimed films have totaled more than $1 billion worldwide. His films have included the immensely successful &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,&rdquo; the chilling horror film &ldquo;The Ring&rdquo; and the recent ragicomic character study &ldquo;The Weather Man.&rdquo; </p><p>Jerry Bruckheimer is one of the most successful producers in the history of both motion pictures and television. First in partnership with Don Simpson, and then as the chief of Jerry Bruckheimer Films, he has produced an unprecedented string of worldwide smashes, hugely impacting not only the industry, but popular culture as well. Bruckheimer&rsquo;s films have included &ldquo;American Gigolo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Flashdance,&rdquo; &ldquo;Days of Thunder,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bad Boys,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dangerous Minds,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crimson Tide,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rock,&rdquo; &ldquo;Con Air,&rdquo; &ldquo;Armageddon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Enemy of the State,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gone in 60 Seconds,&rdquo; &ldquo;Coyote Ugly,&rdquo; &ldquo;Remember the Titans,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pearl Harbor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Black Hawk Down,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bad Boys II,&rdquo; &ldquo;Veronica Guerin,&rdquo; &ldquo;King Arthur,&rdquo; &ldquo;National Treasure&rdquo; and &ldquo;Glory Road.&rdquo; </p><p>In the 2005-6 season, Jerry Bruckheimer had nine series on network television, a feat unprecedented in nearly 60 years of television history. JBTV&rsquo;s series have included &ldquo;C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation&rdquo; and its spinoffs, &ldquo;C.S.I.: Miami&rdquo; and &ldquo;C.S.I.: NY&rdquo;; &ldquo;Without a Trace&rdquo;; &ldquo;Cold Case&rdquo;; and &ldquo;The Amazing Race.&rdquo; </p><p>Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Television have been honored with 35 Academy Award&reg; nominations, </p><p>five Oscars&reg;, eight Grammy&reg; award nominations, five Grammys&reg;, 23 Golden Globe&reg; nominations, four </p><p>Golden Globes&reg;, 43 Emmy&reg; award nominations, seven Emmy&reg; awards, 16 People&rsquo;s Choice nominations, </p><p>six People&rsquo;s Choice Awards and numerous MTV Awards, including one for Best Picture of the Decade. </p><p>Along with Depp, Bloom and Knightley, cast members returning to PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: </p><p>DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST include JACK DAVENPORT as disgraced British Commodore James </p><p>Norrington; JONATHAN PRYCE as Elizabeth&rsquo;s aristocratic father, Governor Weatherby Swann; KEVIN </p><p>R.

The first on-screen image ever to </p><p>appear in an all-live-action Walt Disney Studio feature was none other than a closeup of the skull-andcrossbones Jolly Roger flag in the classic 1950 version of Robert Louis Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Treasure Island.&rdquo; </p><p>Some 53 years later, it took the very same studio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black </p><p>Pearl&rdquo; to spectacularly reinvent and reinvigorate a moribund genre which once again is delighting </p><p>millions. From childhood classics like Treasure Island and Howard Pyle&rsquo;s Book of Pirates, to such classic </p><p>films as &ldquo;The Black Pirate,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Buccaneer&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Crimson Pirate,&rdquo; the swashbuckling tales of high-</p><p>seas derring-do, both nefarious and noble, were seemingly neverending. </p><p>Alas, as far as filmmakers were concerned, pirates were forgotten as subjects worthy of contemporary </p><p>moviemaking. It took Jerry Bruckheimer, Gore Verbinski and a brilliant company of actors and behind-</p><p>the-scenes artists to breathe new life into the Jolly Roger&rsquo;s sails, inspired by the great Disney Theme Parks </p><p>attraction which has enchanted generations since its 1967 debut at Disneyland in Anaheim. The Pirates of </p><p>the Caribbean attraction, which utilized the then-brand-new technology of audio-animatronics which Walt </p><p>Disney and his Imagineers magnificently developed, soon became a major part of pop culture, with its </p><p>cheery refrains of &ldquo;Yo ho yo ho, a pirate&rsquo;s life for me&rdquo; (and the less cheery warning that &ldquo;Dead men tell </p><p>no tales&rdquo;) sung and quoted by millions. </p><p>Using the ride as a springboard, with clever references to the attraction&rsquo;s content sprinkled throughout, </p><p>&ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&rdquo; was a smash hit everywhere it played, amassing </p><p>a domestic U.S. gross of $305,413,918 and, including its record-breaking overseas engagements, a </p><p>worldwide total of $653,913,918. The film also received five Academy Award&reg; nominations, including </p><p>Best Actor for Johnny Depp. Like the ride itself, &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&rdquo; </p><p>appealed to the little bit of pirate that lives within us all, the desire for freedom, adventure and not a small </p><p>amount of mischief. While paying affectionate homage to the cinematic adventures which preceded it, </p><p>&ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&rdquo; sailed into entirely new territory, breaking with </p><p>tradition by linking its high-seas tale with lashings of irreverent humor, as typified by Johnny Depp&rsquo;s </p><p>original and brilliantly inspired creation of Captain Jack Sparrow&hellip;a pirate the likes of which audiences </p><p>had never seen before. </p><p>That success was never a sure thing, Bruckheimer now admits. &ldquo;There were limited expectations for </p><p>the first &lsquo;Pirates.&rsquo; Lots of people thought we were making a Disney ride movie for toddlers, and what&rsquo;s </p><p>more, the pirate genre had been dead for 40 years, and every attempt to revive it had bombed miserably. </p><p>But then &lsquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl&rsquo; was </p><p>released and caught everybody by surprise, </p><p>which is the best way to do it. The artistry </p><p>that Gore and the writers brought to it, and </p><p>the performances by Johnny, Orlando, Keira </p><p>and Geoffrey, just captured everybody&rsquo;s </p><p>imagination and it became a huge success </p><p>internationally. </p><p>&ldquo;Everything that we set up in the first </p><p>movie gets pushed forward in the second,&rdquo; </p><p>Bruckheimer continues, &ldquo;and of course we </p><p>have the same creative team. Gore is such a </p><p>brilliant director, with a wonderful sense of </p><p>humor and a great visual sense. Often, strongly visual directors aren&rsquo;t great storytellers because they focus </p><p>so much on the physical look of the movie. But Gore has both the visual acumen and the understanding </p><p>of storytelling and characterization. </p><p>&ldquo;Johnny, Orlando and Keira are all back for the ride,&rdquo; adds Bruckheimer, &ldquo;plus some wonderful and </p><p>interesting new faces. The Black Pearl will, of course, be back, along with a new mystery ship, the Flying </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>20 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dutchman, which is crewed by a very exciting and unusual group of sailors under the command of </p><p>Davy Jones. </p><p>&ldquo;It all comes down to the imagination of the director, writers and the hundreds of people working on </p><p>the movie,&rdquo; says the producer. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s excited about making an enormous piece of entertainment </p><p>that audiences will love.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&rdquo; not only revived the genre, but kicked off a </p><p>groundswell of fascination for all things piratical which resulted in everything from a spate of new books </p><p>about the seafaring scalawags, to a boom in pirates-themed children&rsquo;s (and adult&rsquo;s) parties, to pirate dinner </p><p>shows, not to mention &ldquo;I (Heart) Jack Sparrow&rdquo; stickers plastered onto schoolgirls&rsquo; binders all over the world. </p><p>Clearly, there was a worldwide mandate for more &ldquo;Pirates,&rdquo; and Jerry Bruckheimer and Gore </p><p>Verbinski, along with Walt Disney Pictures, decided that just one sequel would not be enough. It made </p><p>practical sense, economically, to film two follow-ups simultaneously, taking full advantage of locations, </p><p>sets and availability of its increasingly in-demand stars. It also made sense creatively, because with the </p><p>characters so well established in the first film, taking them on further voyages was an exciting prospect. </p><p>&ldquo;We were hoping for the success of &lsquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl&rsquo; so that we could make more &lsquo;Pirates&rsquo; </p><p>movies,&rdquo; notes Bruckheimer, &ldquo;and when you see the second and third films you&rsquo;ll see that everything </p><p>relates back to what started everything off in the first. It&rsquo;s a true trilogy.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You really need to have some substance behind it,&rdquo; confirms executive producer Mike Stenson. &ldquo;You </p><p>need to not only deliver the entertainment value, the roller-coaster ride and the laughs, but if you&rsquo;re going </p><p>to ask people to stay around for three movies, you have to feel like there&rsquo;s something thematically </p><p>significant that you&rsquo;re going to explore.&rdquo; </p><p>Says screenwriter Terry Rossio, &ldquo;Whereas in the first film, the theme park attraction was a wellspring </p><p>for ideas, for the second and third films we actually went back to the first movie.&rdquo; Adds Rossio&rsquo;s writing </p><p>partner Ted Elliott, &ldquo;There was a richness to the characters that we felt we could explore, but you don&rsquo;t </p><p>want to just go through the same paces with the characters. You don&rsquo;t want to see them doing the same </p><p>thing. One of the things we liked about the characters in the first film was that there&rsquo;s a certain moral </p><p>ambiguity to them, and we wanted to explore that&hellip;we wanted to put Jack Sparrow into a situation where </p><p>he has to do something that, in fact, puts </p><p>his goals in opposition to Will and </p><p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s goals. It was all about </p><p>expanding the characters and taking them </p><p>in a further direction.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Similarly,&rdquo; Rossio continues, &ldquo;much of </p><p>the basis of the first movie was the </p><p>romantic story between Will and </p><p>Elizabeth, and we knew we wanted to get </p><p>into more of a mature examination of the </p><p>relationship between the two of them. </p><p>What happens to Will and Elizabeth after </p><p>that wildly romantic final kiss with the </p><p>beautiful sunset at the end of &lsquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p><p>DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST also dips deeply into the treasure trove of pirate and seagoing lore and </p><p>mythology, from Davy Jones, he of the famous &ldquo;locker,&rdquo; to the legendary Kraken, a sea monster fabled </p><p>since the 12th century. &ldquo;You think of the sea,&rdquo; says Elliott, &ldquo;and there are a lot of supernatural stories </p><p>you&rsquo;ve heard. But nobody had actually done those stories as part of a larger pirate movie or swashbuckler, </p><p>so there was a wealth of legends to draw from. We touched on some of those in the first movie: there&rsquo;s a </p><p>line of dialogue in which Will talks about sending himself down to Davy Jones&rsquo; Locker. So, in DEAD </p><p>MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, we decided to explore who Davy Jones is, and then we brought in another well-known </p><p>legend of the seas, the Flying Dutchman, and combined them together.&rdquo; </p><p>Elliott and Rossio also cleverly utilized one of history&rsquo;s greatest economic and political powers&mdash;the </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ABOUT THE PRODUCTION </p><p>21 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>East India Trading Company&mdash;as a pivotal entity in the plot of DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST. Like much else </p><p>in the &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; movies, historical reality is used as a springboard for fun and fantasy. The real British East </p><p>India Company was a tool of imperialist domination, economically and politically, from 1600 to its </p><p>dissolution in 1858, essentially ruling India and spreading its tentacles as far as the Persian Gulf, </p><p>ABOUT THE PRODUCTION </p><p>Southeast Asia and East Asia. Even the most </p><p>generous contemporary histories describe the </p><p>East India Company&rsquo;s activities as </p><p>extraordinarily greedy and inhumane. &ldquo;What </p><p>we like about pirates,&rdquo; states Elliott, &ldquo;is that </p><p>they represent freedom. And the East India </p><p>Company, as a giant multi-national </p><p>corporation, represents the end of individual </p><p>freedom. They&rsquo;re defining the world as they </p><p>want it to be, and there will be a lot of people </p><p>they&rsquo;re going to leave out. The more dominance </p><p>they have, the less room there is for people like </p><p>Captain Jack Sparrow.&rdquo; </p><p>And Captain Jack Sparrow, it can be said with some degree of authority, is the only truly iconic screen </p><p>character to have yet come out of this new millennium. A wholly original and thrillingly eccentric creation </p><p>conjured up by a famous shape-shifter named Johnny Depp, this ducking, weaving, highly superstitious </p><p>pirate captain of equally dubious morality and personal hygiene became the screen anti-hero for a new </p><p>century. With his long dreadlocks and braided beard adorned with a wild assortment of beads and baubles, </p><p>various and sundry amulets hanging from his attire, and teeth studded with gold and silver, Captain Jack </p><p>Sparrow, like the film itself, appealed to audiences that ran the gamut in age, gender and nationality. </p><p>Depp&rsquo;s performance as Jack Sparrow was recently named one of the 100 greatest performances of all time </p><p>in the May 2006 edition of Premiere magazine, which, tellingly, featured the good Captain&rsquo;s visage on the </p><p>cover more prominently than anyone else&rsquo;s (Depp made the list a second time, for the title role of &ldquo;Edward </p><p>Scissorhands&rdquo;). </p><p>&ldquo;If you ask most people what they loved most about the first movie,&rdquo; says Mike Stenson, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s usually </p><p>this completely iconoclastic Jack Sparrow character. In a 500-channel universe, where you have so many </p><p>different opportunities to be entertained in so many ways, you have to give the audience something that&rsquo;s </p><p>unique and different. That&rsquo;s exactly what Johnny did with Captain Jack Sparrow in &lsquo;The Curse of the </p><p>Black Pearl.&rsquo; He created this character and had absolutely committed to it, and both Jerry and Gore had </p><p>to tell the powers that be to trust them on it after they saw the first dailies. At the end of the day, Johnny </p><p>took a risk, and Jerry and Gore backed him 100 percent.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Johnny is one of our greatest actors,&rdquo; says Bruckheimer. &ldquo;He invented Jack Sparrow in the first </p><p>movie, and he&rsquo;s not somebody who wants to rest on his laurels for the second and third. He takes a </p><p>character to even newer heights. None of us would be back if Johnny had not wanted to play this character </p><p>again. He loved making the first movie, and audiences loved him right back.&rdquo; </p><p>As for Depp, the actor claims that &ldquo;It is beyond me how such a character has sort of taken root in some </p><p>people&rsquo;s hearts. It&rsquo;s still shocking to me. I was handed this opportunity to make something of this </p><p>character, and I had pretty solid ideas about who he was and what he should be like. There were a number </p><p>of people who thought I was nuts. But I was committed to the guy, and I think that&rsquo;s what happened to me </p><p>in terms of finding the character. </p><p>&ldquo;What I set out to do,&rdquo; continues Depp, &ldquo;was to try and make Captain Jack appeal to little kids as well </p><p>as the most hardened adult intellectuals.&rdquo; </p><p>Notes Terry Rossio, &ldquo;One of the archetypes that is really underused in American cinema is the trickster </p><p>character. Most American movies tend to celebrate the warrior who does the right thing at the right time. </p><p>But the fun thing about Jack, who is definitely a trickster, is that he&rsquo;s not particularly good at avoiding </p><p>getting caught. He will get caught&hellip;you just can&rsquo;t hold on to him for very long. Jack knows that if he can </p><p>22 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>just bide his time, eventually the world will come over to his side, and that gives him this sort of supreme </p><p>confidence that he can handle just about any situation.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The other fun thing about the trickster character,&rdquo; continues Ted Elliott, &ldquo;is that he basically is just </p><p>out to have his own good time. He&rsquo;s following his own self-interests. The things he does will affect other </p><p>people&mdash;the mortals, if you will&mdash;and sometimes it will be to good benefit, and sometimes it will be to </p><p>their detriment. So that goes back to the whole question posed in the first movie: is Jack Sparrow a good </p><p>guy or is he a bad guy? Is he a pirate hero or pirate villain? Well, it really kind of depends on the </p><p>perspective you have.&rdquo; </p><p>With &ldquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl&rdquo; having been crucial in launching both actors to major </p><p>international stardom, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were enthusiastic to return alongside Depp as, </p><p>respectively, young lovers Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. (The fourth member of the original quartet, </p><p>Geoffrey Rush, is not in the second film, his character of Captain Barbossa having been dispatched to the </p><p>underworld by Jack Sparrow at the climax of the first film.) Jerry Bruckheimer, who has a knack for </p><p>discovering young talent before the rest of the world catches on, secured Bloom as a young U.S. Ranger </p><p>in &ldquo;Black Hawk Down&rdquo; before the &ldquo;Lord of the Rings&rdquo; trilogy was released and cast Knightley in the first </p><p>&ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; film when she was only 17 years old and &ldquo;Bend It Like Beckham&rdquo;&mdash;which was her </p><p>breakthrough movie in the international arena&mdash;had not yet been released. &ldquo;We could see that Keira was </p><p>an extraordinary actress when we cast her in &lsquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl,&rsquo; Bruckheimer recalls. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s </p><p>not afraid of anything. In the two years </p><p>between the shooting of the first film and </p><p>the start of the second, her skills had </p><p>heightened with the work that she did and </p><p>the experience she gained.&rdquo; (This experience, </p><p>incidentally, included her performance of </p><p>Guinevere in Bruckheimer&rsquo;s production of </p><p>&ldquo;King Arthur.&rdquo;) </p><p>&ldquo;As for Orlando,&rdquo; continues the </p><p>producer, &ldquo;he also did an enormous amount </p><p>of hard work between the first and second </p><p>&lsquo;Pirates,&rsquo; working with some wonderful </p><p>directors, like Ridley Scott and Cameron </p><p>Crowe. Orlando started out as a really terrific screen actor and has only gotten better with time.&rdquo; </p><p>At the hands of screenwriters Elliott and Rossio, Will and Elizabeth were to undergo considerable </p><p>development in the story of DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST. </p><p>Says Bloom, &ldquo;I wanted Will to be less of the kind of earnest, upright young guy of the first movie and, </p><p>this time, to see his darker shades. Will&rsquo;s real journey throughout the second movie is his concern for his </p><p>father, Bootstrap Bill, who is an important element of the first film without actually being seen. Will </p><p>needs to rescue his father from the fate that he&rsquo;s been destined to live on the Flying Dutchman with Davy </p><p>Jones and his frightening crew. So Will&rsquo;s objective is to reconnect with his father and, at the same time, </p><p>somehow maintain his relationship with Elizabeth. Each of the main characters in DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST </p><p>have their own objectives, which are to some extent in conflict with each other&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s a real sense of </p><p>young lovers&rsquo; tension between Will and Elizabeth.&rdquo; </p><p>Keira Knightley, like much of the rest of the world, had been happily surprised by the massive success </p><p>of the first film. &ldquo;We were doing a movie based on a Disney theme-park ride in a genre that hadn&rsquo;t been </p><p>successful in something like 50 years,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;But we had Gore Verbinski, whose vision is quite </p><p>extraordinary, and Johnny Depp, whose portrayal of Jack Sparrow kind of brought the film into a whole </p><p>new phenomenal world. </p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s nice about this movie,&rdquo; adds Knightley, &ldquo;is that the characters have evolved. When we first </p><p>meet Elizabeth at the beginning of the story, she&rsquo;s on the brink of getting married to Will, which falls to </p><p>pieces because a character named Lord Cutler Beckett comes into the equation, and he wants to annihilate </p><p>ABOUT THE PRODUCTION </p><p>23 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ABOUT THE PRODUCTION </p><p>piracy from the world. He&rsquo;s determined to arrest Will for being a pirate and Elizabeth for aiding in the </p><p>escape of Captain Jack Sparrow. Elizabeth becomes a woman on a mission, and there are some quite nice </p><p>undertones to her relationship with Will, as well as to Jack Sparrow&hellip;which grows into something very </p><p>interesting.&rdquo; </p><p>Also returning from &ldquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl&rdquo; is Jack Davenport as James Norrington, the British </p><p>naval officer who loses Elizabeth Swann to Will Turner and gets one-upped time and again by Captain </p><p>Jack Sparrow. &ldquo;Jack Davenport is such a superb actor that we wanted him back in the party,&rdquo; says </p><p>Bruckheimer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fun to work with and created a wonderful character which becomes more embellished, </p><p>richer and adds to the story. Jack is a major player in both the second and third films.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;When we last saw Norrington,&rdquo; says Davenport, &ldquo;he was losing big-time on all fronts. He was losing </p><p>girls, he was losing people out of jail, being humiliated in every way. Hopefully, whilst he was being </p><p>humiliated, you kind of got a sense of him making mature decisions at difficult times. The thing that always </p><p>interested me about the role in the first film was that you have this character who&rsquo;s a leader of men in a </p><p>very public role. And at the end of the first story, he&rsquo;s in a situation where he&rsquo;s having to deal with things </p><p>which are very private in an incredibly public arena, with something like 200 people standing around. </p><p>&ldquo;When I read the script for DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST,&rdquo; Davenport continues, &ldquo;I was delighted to see how </p><p>they developed his character. Norrington has fallen on hard times. He doesn&rsquo;t look the way he looked </p><p>before. He&rsquo;s lost his job, his girl and his self-respect. And suddenly, he has a chance to sign up as a crewman </p><p>with none other than Captain Jack Sparrow. The question is, what&rsquo;s Norrington after? Revenge? Elizabeth? </p><p>Or something else?&rdquo; </p><p>(Coincidentally, Jack Davenport&rsquo;s </p><p>father&mdash;the distinguished British stage </p><p>and screen actor Nigel Davenport&mdash;was </p><p>one of the stars of Alexander </p><p>Mackendrick&rsquo;s &ldquo;A High Wind in </p><p>Jamaica,&rdquo; made some 40 years ago and </p><p>one of the best examples of the genre </p><p>before it vanished from theater screens.) </p><p>One by one, Bruckheimer and </p><p>Verbinski began to assemble the major </p><p>players of a huge cast, including new characters which add so much new life and texture to DEAD </p><p>MAN&rsquo;S CHEST. To portray Davy Jones, who is as much sea creature as he is human, the filmmakers </p><p>selected the extraordinarily versatile British actor Bill Nighy, knowing that he would find the humanity </p><p>beneath the character&rsquo;s beastly veneer. &ldquo;Davy Jones is a deeply damaged and isolated individual,&rdquo; says </p><p>Nighy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wounded so deeply that he determines that he will live a kind of semi-life, as long as it means </p><p>he doesn&rsquo;t have to feel anything anymore. And so, he&rsquo;s torn out the center of all feeling&mdash;his heart&mdash;and </p><p>locks it in a special chest. He also has control of a &lsquo;pet,&rsquo; as it&rsquo;s sometimes referred to, which is the </p><p>Kraken&mdash;a sea monster which is the likes of which you&rsquo;ve never seen before, entirely malevolent, evil and </p><p>powerful beyond expression. If you possess Davy Jones&rsquo; heart, you control not only him, but the Kraken </p><p>as well, which in effect gives you control of the oceans.&rdquo; </p><p>Nighy&rsquo;s primary challenge would be that because of Davy Jones&rsquo; astonishing physical appearance, he </p><p>would be acting throughout the film in what resembles a gray track suit and matching cap with reference </p><p>marks for Industrial Light &amp; Magic&rsquo;s computer wizards, who would embellish it with the amazing details </p><p>as imagined by Gore Verbinski and famed conceptual artist Mark &ldquo;Crash&rdquo; McCreery. But Nighy was game </p><p>to take it on. &ldquo;The first movie was not only successful,&rdquo; he notes, &ldquo;but is actually beloved, and has entered </p><p>the language in a way that I think few movies do. To be part of this was a very satisfying notion. As for </p><p>playing a character which will be physically embellished by computer wizardry, as an actor you use your </p><p>imagination. The same things are required of you, generally speaking. </p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; adds Nighy dryly, &ldquo;in DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST I&rsquo;m playing a man who has an octopus </p><p>growing out of my chin, which I must admit, has thus far been outside of my experience.&rdquo; </p><p>24 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other new villain of DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST&mdash;perhaps even more villainous than Davy Jones, </p><p>whose viciousness stems from his all-too-human heartbreak from a thwarted love from the past&mdash;is the </p><p>cold, calculating and utterly ruthless Lord Cutler Beckett. Invited to inhabit this dastardly soul was Tom </p><p>Hollander, who so brilliantly portrayed Reverend Collins, the diminutive and hapless suitor of Keira </p><p>Knightley&rsquo;s Elizabeth Bennet, in &ldquo;Pride &amp; Prejudice.&rdquo; Hollander was attracted to playing Beckett because, </p><p>like the other characters developed for both the first and second films, he was multi-dimensional. &ldquo;Soft </p><p>glove, hard fist,&rdquo; notes the actor of his Beckett. &ldquo;On the outside, he&rsquo;s very arrogant and charming, but the </p><p>inside is incredibly hard.&rdquo; Hollander also saw some similarities between the East India Trading Company, </p><p>as depicted in the story, and the modern world. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a modern parallel to how Lord Cutler Beckett and </p><p>the East India Company operates in the story, with the pirates&mdash;who symbolize absolute freedom&mdash;being </p><p>squeezed out ruthlessly. </p><p>&ldquo;Especially Jack Sparrow,&rdquo; Hollander continues, &ldquo;who in Beckett&rsquo;s view is naughty, messy, has </p><p>dreadlocks, could do with a few more baths and, worst of all, is a pirate. To Cutler Beckett, Jack Sparrow </p><p>is a stray dog.&rdquo; </p><p>Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd, who has been a major star in his native Sweden since the 1970s and has become an </p><p>international player of considerable reputation and abilities, was pleased to be asked by Verbinski and </p><p>Bruckheimer to portray Bootstrap Bill Turner&hellip;a character much discussed in &ldquo;The Curse of the Black </p><p>Pearl&rdquo; but heretofore unseen. Skarsg&aring;rd was well known to Bruckheimer, who had previously cast the </p><p>actor as a marauding Teutonic in &ldquo;King Arthur.&rdquo; &ldquo;Stellan is a world-class actor,&rdquo; says Bruckheimer, &ldquo;and </p><p>Johnny and Orlando wanted to work with him. We knew that with Bootstrap Bill, Stellan would create a </p><p>wonderful, compassionate and interesting portrait of a man who&rsquo;s losing himself bit by bit.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You could see in the first film that there was a lot of space for the actors to expand and bloom within </p><p>scenes,&rdquo; says Skarsg&aring;rd. &ldquo;You also felt like they had a lot of fun doing it, which is very endearing.&rdquo; </p><p>Another compelling new character in DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, the mysterious Caribbean soothsayer </p><p>Tia Dalma, is essayed by one of Britain&rsquo;s brightest young talents, Naomie Harris. &ldquo;Tia Dalma&rsquo;s a gypsy </p><p>queen, a free spirit, someone who has magic powers and the ability to see through people and understand </p><p>their deepest desires,&rdquo; explains Harris. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very powerful woman, which I really like. She has </p><p>associations with the elements of nature, and she&rsquo;s fiery and temperamental.&rdquo; </p><p>David Schofield, the noted British character actor cast as Mercer, Lord Cutler Beckett&rsquo;s merciless </p><p>enforcer, was delighted at the prospect of working with Keira Knightley. The last time he had seen her in </p><p>person was when she was three years old, and Schofield was performing on stage at the Chichester </p><p>(England) Festival with her father, actor Will Knightley. Schofield was also amazed at how many of his </p><p>countrymen (and -women) were to be performing in the second &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; film. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like there are all these </p><p>English theater actors being floated on a very luxurious Walt Disney mattress to exotic places. And they </p><p>can chat away happily about their English lives and their English feelings about things. But they&rsquo;re </p><p>supported by this American structure. It&rsquo;s a bit like an English glove with an American hand in it.&rdquo; </p><p>Then there are the returnees who have come back to take yet another fantastic voyage on the Black </p><p>Pearl. &ldquo;I never expected to be back,&rdquo; says Jonathan Pryce, who indeed is back as Port Royal Governor </p><p>Weatherby Swann, Elizabeth&rsquo;s loving if slightly befuddled father. Having missed all of the original </p><p>screenings and premieres of the first film because of his busy schedule, Pryce finally bought himself a </p><p>ticket to a cinema in London, &ldquo;and could barely get a seat, which I thought was ironic. It was four or five </p><p>weeks after its initial opening, but the cinema was packed. It was a wonderful experience seeing the film </p><p>with a real audience, watching them laughing and watching the screen in amazement. It was very </p><p>gratifying to be in a commercial film that audience, young and old, responded to so well.&rdquo; </p><p>Returning as Pintel and Ragetti&mdash;who endeared themselves to audiences as a sublime comedic pairing </p><p>in &ldquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl&rdquo;&mdash;are, respectively, Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook. &ldquo;Pintel and </p><p>Ragetti are marvelous characters to begin with,&rdquo; says Jerry Bruckheimer, &ldquo;but Lee and Mackenzie did a </p><p>brilliant job of taking something that was on the page and amping it to the nth degree.&rdquo; </p><p>True to their roles, the U.S.-born Arenberg and British native Crook genuinely hit it off during the </p><p>filming of the first &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; film, inseparable off as well as on screen. &ldquo;We sort of stick together like some </p><p>ABOUT THE PRODUCTION </p><p>25 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A PIRATE ODYSSEY </p><p>sort of 18th-century piratical Laurel and </p><p>Hardy,&rdquo; notes Arenberg. &ldquo;I always say that </p><p>the luckiest thing that happened to me is that </p><p>they couldn&rsquo;t find short, bald and crazy in </p><p>London who was the right match for </p><p>Mackenzie. So they had an audition for </p><p>short, bald and crazy guys in Hollywood, and </p><p>that was a little bit of Kismet for me.&rdquo; </p><p>Adds Crook, &ldquo;Pintel and Ragetti are </p><p>pirates who, like most pirates, can swing </p><p>either good or bad depending on who&rsquo;s </p><p>paying the best fee. They&rsquo;re the classic </p><p>double act&mdash;one thinks he&rsquo;s intelligent, and </p><p>the other one appears stupid&mdash;plus Pintel and Ragetti had the foresight to stick their hands up and </p><p>surrender at the end of the first movie.&rdquo; </p><p>Jokes Crook, &ldquo;We were smiling then because we knew we were making the sequel, and all the other </p><p>guys fooling around on deck didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the expectations were for the first film,&rdquo; admits Kevin R. McNally, whose </p><p>Joshamee Gibbs has an encyclopedic knowledge of the lore of the seven seas and an epicurean taste for </p><p>rum. &ldquo;Working on it, I had no idea what I was in, really, until I watched it with a group of friends in the </p><p>cinema. It came as a pleasant surprise to see just how good it was, adventurous, funny and character-rich. </p><p>I thought my pirate days were over, but when I was shooting &lsquo;The Phantom of the Opera&rsquo; I met Mike </p><p>Stenson from Jerry Bruckheimer Films, who said &lsquo;Pack your bags, Kevin, we&rsquo;re going pirating again.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I went into a state of bliss when I heard </p><p>they wanted me back for the second and </p><p>third movies,&rdquo; says David Bailie, who </p><p>portrays the speechless pirate Cotton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m </p><p>in my mid-60s, and not many actors can </p><p>round off their career doing three major </p><p>movies and all that it implies.&rdquo; </p><p>When the filming of &ldquo;The Curse of the </p><p>Black Pearl&rdquo; finished, actor Martin </p><p>Klebba&mdash;who plays his namesake, Marty, a </p><p>Black Pearl crew member of short stature </p><p>but tall spirit&mdash;recalls that when he heard a </p><p>second (and third) &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; movie was to be </p><p>made, &ldquo;I thought, if they bring me back, cool. If they don&rsquo;t, you know, I had a great time and enjoyed the </p><p>opportunity. When I got a call asking me to come in for a costume fitting for DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST and </p><p>&lsquo;Pirates III,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;Wow! How often does this happen to an actor?!&rsquo;&rdquo; </p><p>2005 (and &rsquo;06): A Pirate Odyssey </p><p>If the filming of &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&rdquo; was an epic, then the </p><p>shooting of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST could only be described, in the </p><p>ancient sense, as an odyssey. Journeying from location to location, island to island, production was, in </p><p>every sense, bigger than life, fraught with fantastic adventures, Promethean ambitions, Sisyphean </p><p>challenges, Herculean triumphs. More than a year of filming (albeit with occasional breaks, and with </p><p>much time devoted to the concurrent shooting of &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean III&rdquo;), a good part of it in the </p><p>Caribbean, inspired the cast and crew&mdash;many of them grizzled veterans of dozens of productions&mdash;to </p><p>redefine the parameters of their own experiences. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>26 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;A movie like this becomes the pinnacle of your career,&rdquo; notes executive producer Bruce Hendricks, </p><p>who is also Walt Disney Pictures&rsquo; president of physical production. &ldquo;More than any other movie I&rsquo;ve been </p><p>involved with&mdash;and I think now I&rsquo;ve been involved with almost 300 of them in one way or another&mdash;the </p><p>&lsquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rsquo; movies are the ones that you look back on and say, wow, we really accomplished </p><p>something.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was like fighting a war,&rdquo; recalls Eric McLeod, also an executive producer on the film. &ldquo;We had to </p><p>build roads into places where people never filmed before, up mountainsides, through jungles, down into </p><p>beaches. In Dominica we had 500 cast and crew spread out in 80 different hotels, condos and houses. We </p><p>had 150 drivers spread out through the island every day to go pick up all those people. There were 40 </p><p>accountants working out of offices in Los Angeles, Mobile, Alabama, St. Vincent, Dominica, the Bahamas </p><p>and the United Kingdom, working with seven different currencies. It was a moving army. The focus is </p><p>what&rsquo;s happening in front of the camera, but there&rsquo;s a massive circle of support required to get to that place.&rdquo; </p><p>Serious preparation for PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST and &ldquo;Pirates of the </p><p>Caribbean III&rdquo; got underway in June 2004. Based upon the script by Elliott and Rossio, the production </p><p>team knew that one island location&mdash;as it was in the first film&mdash;would not suffice. &ldquo;From the early </p><p>meetings with Jerry, Gore, Ted and Terry, we started to get a sense from the logistic standpoint of where </p><p>we were going,&rdquo; recalls unit production manager Doug Merrifield, who served in the same position on </p><p>&ldquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl.&rdquo; &ldquo;We knew that this time, we were going to be on various islands, versus </p><p>just St. Vincent. We were going to have more ships to deal with. It was becoming apparent that we were </p><p>going to be a road movie&hellip;although those roads were actually vast bodies of water between the different </p><p>locations. Beginning in late spring/early summer &rsquo;04, we began to thoroughly scout the Caribbean once </p><p>again.&rdquo; </p><p>The pirate strongholds of Port Royal and Tortuga, familiar to viewers of &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The </p><p>Curse of the Black Pearl,&rdquo; were newly designed by Rick Heinrichs and reconstructed in St. Vincent&rsquo;s </p><p>Wallilabou Bay, which also served as the location for the first film. Dominica, a green and unspoiled </p><p>paradise of burgeoning eco-tourism that&rsquo;s just 29 miles long and 16 miles wide with a population of only </p><p>71,000, served as the backdrop for an extraordinary range of locations, from its palm-studded beaches, </p><p>jungles and rain forests to a lofty plateau. And in the Bahamas, the company would film in both The </p><p>Exumas and, further north in the chain, in an oceanfront facility on Grand Bahama Island. </p><p>&ldquo;Some of these islands have few hotels, not many restaurants, little infrastructure,&rdquo; says executive </p><p>producer Chad Oman. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Gore having a huge imagination and a tough gut to choose those locations </p><p>despite the challenges, and you&rsquo;ve got to give credit to the studio for allowing him to do that. Dick Cook, </p><p>Nina Jacobson and Bruce Hendricks all put a lot of confidence in both Gore and Jerry.&rdquo; </p><p>At highest ebb, nearly 1,000 people were working in various departments during pre-production of </p><p>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, ranging the world from Los Angeles to </p><p>London to the Caribbean. It was an effort which defined &ldquo;synergy,&rdquo; as artists and craftsmen pooled their </p><p>skills to invent the impossible. And writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio did not just deposit the splendid </p><p>screenplay with the filmmakers and sail off into the sunset. Instead, they sailed off with the company to </p><p>every single location, a constant presence on the set, constantly creating and reinventing whenever the </p><p>need arose. &ldquo;The reason our writers are here is because we have such a creative director and cast,&rdquo; explains </p><p>Jerry Bruckheimer. &ldquo;They come up with such imaginative ideas, and Ted and Terry can incorporate those </p><p>into the script before we actually shoot a particular scene. Plus, we&rsquo;re always finding new things and </p><p>nuances when we film. Ted and Terry are so easy to work with, they love being on location, and they&rsquo;re </p><p>very fast on their feet.&rdquo; </p><p>Throughout filming, Bruckheimer, Verbinski, Elliott and Rossio would relentlessly pick over the script </p><p>with the minute attention to detail and seriousness of Talmudic scholars, which may come as something </p><p>of a surprise, considering the rambunctious humor of the &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; movies. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no heavier burden </p><p>than great potential,&rdquo; sighed Ted Elliott at one point in the Caribbean, quoting that great American </p><p>philosopher, Charlie Brown. The filmmakers were aware of how high the expectations were for the new </p><p>&ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; films and were absolutely determined not to take any easy shortcuts. </p><p>27 </p><p>A PIRATE ODYSSEY </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE VOYAGE BEGINS </p><p>Los Angeles: The Voyage Begins </p><p>Principal photography of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST and the third </p><p>entry of the trilogy began on February 28, 2005 with studio and location work in L.A., and although the </p><p>first few sets were relatively modest&mdash;the rum locker of the Black Pearl and the interior of the Port Royal </p><p>jailhouse&mdash;production designer Rick Heinrichs&rsquo; large-scale masterworks were yet to be seen. </p><p>The natural locations and sets designed by Heinrichs unleashed his limitless imagination, providing </p><p>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST with vastly scaled and richly imaginative </p><p>backdrops&hellip;not to mention a small fleet of new ships, including a redesigned, rebuilt and fully seaworthy </p><p>Black Pearl; Davy Jones&rsquo; magnificently detailed and terrifying Flying Dutchman; and the sleek 18thcentury British merchant ship Edinburgh Trader. Heinrichs and his creative team designed a huge range </p><p>of settings, from a massive swampland built on a Burbank soundstage, to the small but intricate dead </p><p>man&rsquo;s chest of the subtitle. </p><p>&ldquo;An amazing, creative individual,&rdquo; says Jerry Bruckheimer of Heinrichs. Adds Johnny Depp, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had </p><p>the pleasure of working with Rick Heinrichs a number of times now over the years. And boy, oh boy, talk </p><p>about somebody outdoing themselves. He&rsquo;s really gone far into the stratosphere and done some </p><p>monumental work. My initial reaction to much of the sets was&hellip;can I get the blueprints? &rsquo;Cause I want to </p><p>build this somewhere and live in it. Rick is a very gifted, talented artist, and we&rsquo;re super lucky to have him.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I got excited when I first spoke to Gore,&rdquo; recalls Heinrichs, &ldquo;because he was sitting there drawing these </p><p>images of pirate ships and monsters, saying that he was taking what he had established in the first film to </p><p>a whole other level of mythology. We&rsquo;re going to attempt to strike a similar balance in this film of scary </p><p>and humorous elements, which really goes back to the original theme-park attraction. </p><p>&ldquo;Hopefully, people will be going home </p><p>from this movie with the same kind of </p><p>excitement that audiences got from the </p><p>Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn movies </p><p>in the earlier part of the 20th century&hellip;but </p><p>with the kind of technology that we can </p><p>bring to bear on it now,&rdquo; continues </p><p>Heinrichs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to take the first </p><p>&lsquo;Pirates&rsquo; film to the next step of virtuosity </p><p>so that we can walk that line between horror </p><p>and humor that gives you a great sense of </p><p>tingling excitement.&rdquo; </p><p>Heinrichs was also intrigued by the fact </p><p>that although Verbinski&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; films are to some degree rooted in history, they&rsquo;re not imprisoned by </p><p>it. The films&rsquo; exact period is deliberately nebulous, but more or less the 1720s during the golden age of </p><p>piracy in the Caribbean. &ldquo;One of the things I like to do when I&rsquo;m approaching a project that&rsquo;s offered to </p><p>me and when I&rsquo;m trying to figure out whether to do it or not is&mdash;for instance&mdash;if it&rsquo;s a period piece, is it </p><p>something that I can bring something to, or is the director trying to simply retell something historically </p><p>and wanting absolute period accuracy. That doesn&rsquo;t particularly interest me. What I love about &lsquo;Pirates&rsquo; </p><p>and working with Gore is the fact that the history and period are backdrops, something that gives us a </p><p>sense of time and place. But everybody is excited to take that to the next level of stylization and re-</p><p>imagining. It&rsquo;s like taking the elements and shaking them up and creating something different out of </p><p>them.&rdquo; </p><p>Heinrichs, along with supervising art director John Dexter, three art directors, seven assistant art </p><p>directors, nine set designers, a props set designer, three conceptual artists, six illustrators, three model </p><p>makers, and various and sundry graphic designers, coordinators, researchers and assistants&mdash;not to </p><p>mention affiliated departments headed by set decorator Cheryl Carasik, property master Kris Peck and </p><p>construction coordinator Greg Callas&mdash;would achieve wonders on land and sea for DEAD MAN&rsquo;S </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>28 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHEST. A visit to the &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; art department at Walt Disney Studios during pre-production revealed </p><p>detailed models, mountains of reference books, conceptual illustrations, blueprints and walls plastered </p><p>from one end to the other with reference artwork, from old paintings and etchings of ships, sea and </p><p>landscapes to ethnographic photographs, design sketches and reproductions of Howard Pyle illustrations </p><p>from his classic Book of Pirates (which both Verbinski and Heinrichs found &ldquo;highly inspirational&rdquo;). </p><p>While respecting, and often building upon, the designs of the first &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; film, Heinrichs and his </p><p>team sought to &ldquo;take things as far as we could to make the settings real, living things,&rdquo; according to </p><p>supervising art director John Dexter. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why so much of the research we do is from natural forms.&rdquo; </p><p>Already under construction in Bayou La Batre, </p><p>Alabama&mdash;famed for its shipyards and expert </p><p>shipbuilders&mdash;was the brand-new, fully seaworthy and </p><p>subtly redesigned Black Pearl. &ldquo;Because of the </p><p>importance of the ships, it&rsquo;s almost like we had our own </p><p>mini art department that was dedicated just to their </p><p>design,&rdquo; notes Rick Heinrichs. &ldquo;We had the best guys </p><p>available, some of whom had worked on other ship </p><p>pictures in the past, &lsquo;Master and Commander&rsquo; and </p><p>others. We were also aided by visual technology. All of </p><p>our ships were modeled in the computer as well, which </p><p>allowed us to transfer files back and forth between the </p><p>marine architect and engineers, who would tell us what </p><p>was going to be stable and not fall over in the water, and </p><p>that could withstand the kinds of speeds and stresses that </p><p>these ships were going to be in. The struggle was to </p><p>attain a certain look, and to do within a practical </p><p>package as well. They had to be affordable, they had to be floatable, and they had to be something that </p><p>looked good at the same time. </p><p>&ldquo;We took the Black Pearl and gave it a little bit more of a swoop,&rdquo; continues Heinrichs. &ldquo;The Black </p><p>Pearl in the first film was established, to some degree, by the set of circumstances that they had. They built </p><p>the ship directly onto a barge and were limited by the dimensions of that barge. We&rsquo;ve had a little more </p><p>freedom in this. I think that Gore discovered what he liked and what he didn&rsquo;t like in the first film, and </p><p>he wanted a much more flexible Black Pearl that could move faster than one or two knots.&rdquo; </p><p>The answer was for the production to build the new Black Pearl around an existing 109-foot-long boat </p><p>called the Sunset, an unglamorous craft which once serviced oil derricks in the Gulf of Mexico. It took </p><p>eight months of construction to build the new Black Pearl around the old Sunset, and by the time work </p><p>was finished, something familiar, yet brand-new, had been created. &ldquo;The result was that from the waterline </p><p>up you had this beautiful pirate ship, the Black Pearl,&rdquo; notes picture boat coordinator Will White. &ldquo;But the </p><p>Sunset is still in there somewhere, with engines, fuel and water tanks, a galley and bunks.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;In this movie, the Pearl is a much sexier, cool, edgier ship than last time,&rdquo; adds supervising art director </p><p>John Dexter. True to its name, the Pearl has to appear black, but as Dexter points out, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t just be </p><p>black&hellip;it has to have life to it. There are some metal pieces on the ship that rust. There&rsquo;s certainly the sea </p><p>spray. We started with flat black and moved to something that was a little more interesting.&rdquo; </p><p>Also under construction at this point for filming later in both Dominica and the Bahamas was the </p><p>stupendous Flying Dutchman. 170 feet long, 420 tons of brute nautical force, her rotting wooden decks </p><p>overgrown with barnacles, mussels and other detritus of the seven seas, the skeletal, crocodilian figure on </p><p>the foremast resembling a terrifying predator, her sails shredded into shards, her halls decked with boughs </p><p>of seaweed, 36 sealife-encrusted but fully operative cannons on either side of her hull, and two lethal </p><p>revolving cannons emerging from her bow threatening any and all who dare to stray into her path. The </p><p>Flying Dutchman and her crew have become so organically bound that it&rsquo;s difficult to tell where one ends </p><p>and the other begins. The ship becomes more alive as her crewmen become more a part of her. </p><p>THE VOYAGE BEGINS </p><p>29 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE VOYAGE BEGINS </p><p>&ldquo;When we were designing and building a set,&rdquo; says Rick Heinrichs, &ldquo;we tried to get a sense of reality, </p><p>place and history to that set by using color and texture which hopefully adds up into character. Something </p><p>that behind the actors will make it feel like they&rsquo;re really in the environment. I think that reaches its zenith </p><p>with the Flying Dutchman. We wanted it to be an actual character in the film. We&rsquo;ve put a lot of sea forms </p><p>everywhere&mdash;ferns, mollusks, barnacles and all the stuff that grows underwater. Whenever it&rsquo;s being shot, </p><p>they&rsquo;re wetting down the boat to make sure it feels alive. </p><p>&ldquo;The Dutchman was developed with an </p><p>eye towards history and a sense of the </p><p>architecture of ships in the 17th century,&rdquo; </p><p>Heinrichs continues. &ldquo;I wanted it to already </p><p>feel old in the period that the story takes </p><p>place in the early 18th century. I think the </p><p>Flying Dutchman has a combination of </p><p>historical elements, layered with fantastical </p><p>elements.&rdquo; </p><p>The Flying Dutchman was partially </p><p>inspired by old Dutch &ldquo;fluyts&rdquo;&mdash;17th</p><p>century vessels which resembled galleons&mdash; </p><p>and more specifically, the Vasa, a massive </p><p>Swedish warship which sunk in Stockholm&rsquo;s harbor upon its maiden voyage in 1628 (the ship was </p><p>salvaged in 1961 and is now housed in a special museum in the Swedish capital). With its high, heavily </p><p>ornamented stern, the ship provided a rich foundation for Rick Heinrichs&rsquo; wilder and more fantastical </p><p>designs. </p><p>&ldquo;Rick and I tossed ideas back and forth for the Dutchman six months before we started filming,&rdquo; </p><p>explains supervising art director John Dexter. &ldquo;About three months after that, we got engineers involved </p><p>and our marine department, who let us know what we could and could not do with its design. Luckily, we </p><p>were very close. Then we hired set designers, model makers and illustrators to help us flesh those ideas </p><p>out and get them ready for construction. We built the ship simultaneously in Los Angeles and Grand </p><p>Bahama Island. </p><p>&ldquo;It was such an incredibly challenging, beautiful piece,&rdquo; continues Dexter, &ldquo;and since it&rsquo;s such a central </p><p>icon for the picture, we wanted it to look great. We started with a stiffened hull, a watertight compartment, </p><p>then a steel structure off of that. Then our guys stepped in and applied a lot of wood structure from there, </p><p>some steel to strengthen it, and then sculpted spray foam over that, followed by plaster.&rdquo; </p><p>Working closely with Heinrichs, as he had done for years, was construction coordinator Greg Callas, </p><p>at the head of a department which, at its height, included some 450 craftsmen, encompassing carpenters, </p><p>plasterers, painters, landscapers and sculptors. </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never built a ship before, and there&rsquo;s a whole glossary of terms that you have to learn to understand </p><p>a wooden pirate ship,&rdquo; explains Greg Callas. &ldquo;We had to manufacture the capstan and the wheel, fife rail, </p><p>mizzenmast, mainmast, foremast&hellip;all of these things that I&rsquo;d never imagined. There were a lot of people </p><p>involved in making the Black Pearl. We have a marine department which helped make the vessel run with </p><p>diesel motors. A rigging department to outfit everything with sails&hellip;rigging today is done with cables, but </p><p>on the Pearl, as well as the Flying Dutchman, it&rsquo;s all period rigging with ropes, and then everything had </p><p>to be aged to look old. The sails had to be created according to 18th-century period. You just don&rsquo;t go </p><p>down to a marine store and buy this stuff. Everything we did had to be manufactured.&rdquo; </p><p>The Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman were each constructed up to their first set of fighting tops, </p><p>with four complete sets of sails. The remainder of the masts and sails would be supplied later by the ubertech wizards of Industrial Light &amp; Magic. </p><p>On the expansive grounds of what was once the aquatic theme park Marineland in Palos Verdes, with </p><p>an endless view of the Pacific Ocean, Heinrichs designed and built a Port Royal church for one of the </p><p>opening scenes of DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, in which Will and Elizabeth&rsquo;s wedding is rudely interrupted </p><p>30 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>by Lord Cutler Beckett and a troop of East India Trading Company militiamen. Not so coincidentally, it </p><p>was on this exact spot nearly three years earlier that Port Royal&rsquo;s Fort Charles was constructed for the first </p><p>&ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; epic. </p><p>Constructing the Port Royal church in Palos Verdes was the first of many struggles that the production </p><p>had against the most unpredictable and uncontrollable of production challenges: Mother Nature. &ldquo;When we </p><p>started to build the church exterior, we got 35 inches of rain,&rdquo; recalls Greg Callas. &ldquo;We lost 11 days to rain </p><p>at that location, so we worked 24 hours a day for the last two weeks before shooting to complete that set.&rdquo; </p><p>How coincidental that the three scheduled days of filming in the church set required torrential rain, </p><p>which had to be provided by the special effects department! </p><p>Filming then shifted back to Stage 1 at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, where the gun and hold decks </p><p>of the Black Pearl were designed and constructed with extraordinary realism, the burnished wood looking </p><p>like it had been weathered on rough seas for 50 years rather than a few weeks old. When outfitted by set </p><p>decorator Cheryl Carasik with the appropriate accoutrements&mdash;such as criss-crossing hammocks on the </p><p>hold deck and period-correct baskets, ropes, and gently swinging lanterns&mdash;the illusion of reality was </p><p>complete. Mounted on a gimbal, four hydraulic pistons on opposite sides of the set provided a rolling </p><p>motion which effectively mimicked the sea, providing the cast and crew with a milder sneak preview of </p><p>what would come later on the real Black Pearl while shooting in the Caribbean. </p><p>Also at Disney Studios, the captain&rsquo;s cabins of both the Black Pearl and Edinburgh Trader were </p><p>constructed on Stage 5 for interior sequences. Filled with lustrous period detail, much of Captain Jack&rsquo;s </p><p>cabin interior was constructed of solid, beautifully grained mahogany. Leaping a few miles to the </p><p>Universal Studios backlot, Rick Heinrichs, John Dexter, Cheryl Carasik and their teams accomplished an </p><p>extreme makeover of the legendary &ldquo;Europe Street&rdquo; area, originally built for the 1939 Charles Laughton </p><p>version of &ldquo;The Hunchback of Notre Dame,&rdquo; converting it into the atmospheric streets and back alleys of </p><p>Port Royal and Tortuga. Authentic-looking early-18th-century signage appeared on the shopfronts, and </p><p>with the addition of a massive overhanging silk, an open courtyard was converted into a large Tortuga </p><p>tavern, where Captain Jack and Will Turner search for a crew of souls to man the Flying Dutchman. </p><p>This sequence culminates in a boisterous brawl meticulously choreographed by stunt coordinator </p><p>George Marshall Ruge, with the help of his second-in-command, Dan Barringer. This provided the </p><p>physically fearless Keira Knightley with </p><p>her first opportunity to shine. &ldquo;I had about </p><p>two weeks&rsquo; training for that in an L.A. </p><p>studio. When we actually came to shoot it, </p><p>it was slightly different because, rather than </p><p>an open studio, we were in a location just </p><p>crammed full of people, and it was a night </p><p>shoot as well. I didn&rsquo;t get to do my bit until </p><p>about four in the morning, which isn&rsquo;t </p><p>really the best way to do a fight sequence. I </p><p>just drank a lot of coffee.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Keira is a real quick study,&rdquo; confirms </p><p>Ruge, &ldquo;and a true athlete. We&rsquo;re pretty </p><p>jaded in this business, but the crew was pretty amazed at what Keira accomplished. When you get </p><p>applause like that on set, it&rsquo;s a good sign.&rdquo; </p><p>Ruge, who also coordinated the amazing stunts on the first &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; film, was delighted to reunite </p><p>with so many of the same personnel&hellip;particularly the stars. &ldquo;Johnny&rsquo;s a natural who doesn&rsquo;t let on that it </p><p>comes so easily to him,&rdquo; says the stunt coordinator. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very good athlete who colors all of the action </p><p>with character. DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST is my fifth film with Orlando, and they&rsquo;ve all been big action </p><p>movies. He&rsquo;s also a fantastic athlete and loves performing action. I keep telling Keira that if it ever falls </p><p>apart for her, we&rsquo;ll give her a T-shirt and a hat and bring her on the stunt team. Her physicality is fantastic.&rdquo; </p><p>Hundreds of colorful extras authentically attired by costume designer Penny Rose in perfectly filthy </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE VOYAGE BEGINS </p><p>31 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE VOYAGE BEGINS </p><p>and worn clothes, and carefully made up and coiffed to look like the scurvy knaves they were, populated </p><p>the tavern, flickering with candlelight and roistering with noise. Inside of the tavern, various foods fit for </p><p>a pirate&rsquo;s palette were displayed on long wooden tables, including scooped-out bread loaves filled with </p><p>stew and soup&hellip;curiously resembling a dish served in Disneyland&rsquo;s New Orleans Square just near the </p><p>entrance of the &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rdquo; attraction. The food stylists working on DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST </p><p>insisted that the resemblance was entirely coincidental. </p><p>Throughout the filming of DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, Penny Rose was like a master builder, only with </p><p>fabrics rather than bricks and mortar. Rose approved of every single costume that went on every single body, </p><p>whether one of the stars or an extra who&rsquo;s the sixth pirate from the left. Notes Lee Arenberg, &ldquo;Penny is </p><p>amazing because she&rsquo;ll have a pile of clothes sitting there, and with her keen eye she&rsquo;ll pick a garment out, </p><p>have it distressed, aged, dyed, and suddenly, it becomes more than a costume. It becomes your character.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Penny Rose is a force of nature,&rdquo; says Tom Hollander, who portrays Lord Cutler Beckett. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very </p><p>important person on the film, with boundless energy. In her wardrobe warehouse, Penny is like an empress </p><p>in a sort of tent of fabrics, with a lot of assistants rushing around, bringing this and that. &ldquo;No, the brocade. </p><p>No, the gold. Bring the blue. I&rsquo;m sick of the red. No, take it out. Bring it back. Take it in. Pull it down.&rdquo; </p><p>Rose supervised a department which under her expert supervision literally combed the world for </p><p>fabrics and materials from which to create the more than 8,000 costumes required for DEAD MAN&rsquo;S </p><p>CHEST and &ldquo;Pirates III,&rdquo; all of which she designed with the aid of associate costume designer John </p><p>Norster, costume supervisor Kenny Crouch (both whom she refers to as &ldquo;the most important men in my </p><p>life&rdquo;), and a large staff of costumers, cutters, ager/dyers, buyers, painters, leathermakers and various </p><p>assistants. Of paramount importance to Rose was for the costumes to look as if they were created in the </p><p>18th century in every detail. &ldquo;I only do real,&rdquo; says Rose. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of fantasy in the story, but not in </p><p>the costumes. We want these clothes to look like they&rsquo;ve been slept in and worn forever. Aging and dyeing </p><p>for a period film are absolutely vital. I don&rsquo;t like people to look as if they&rsquo;ve just walked out of a shop. </p><p>It&rsquo;s a really specialized field and very underestimated and undervalued, and the people who do it are </p><p>geniuses because it&rsquo;s very subtle. And all of the shoes go into a cement mixer with a few rocks, and by the </p><p>time they come out they&rsquo;ve aged five years.&rdquo; </p><p>Penny Rose&rsquo;s costumes for the leading </p><p>players indicate their transitions as </p><p>characters. For DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, </p><p>there are virtually no changes at all in </p><p>Johnny Depp&rsquo;s Jack Sparrow costume. </p><p>&ldquo;Johnny just feels dead right,&rdquo; notes Rose. </p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s added a few things this time. He&rsquo;s a </p><p>very thoughtful, caring actor in terms of </p><p>how he looks in character.&rdquo; Captain Jack </p><p>Sparrow&rsquo;s now-famous look was a </p><p>collaboration in the first film between </p><p>Penny Rose, key makeup artist Ve Neill, </p><p>key hairstylist Martin Samuel, and Depp himself. &ldquo;Having spent some time with Keith Richards was </p><p>certainly a huge part of the inspiration for the character,&rdquo; says the actor, invoking the name of the great </p><p>guitarist for The Rolling Stones. &ldquo;I spent a little time with Keith here and there, and each time I&rsquo;d see him </p><p>he&rsquo;d have a new thing tied into his hair. &lsquo;What is that hanging?&rsquo; I&rsquo;d ask, and Keith would say, &lsquo;Ah yeah, I </p><p>got that in Bermuda,&rsquo; or wherever. So it felt to me like Jack, on his travels and adventures, would see </p><p>something and go, &lsquo;Oh yeah, I&rsquo;ll keep that,&rsquo; tie it in his hair or have someone else do it. Each little trinket </p><p>would have a story. For example, the bone that hangs just above the bandana is a shinbone from a reindeer. </p><p>Then Jack has the dangly bits, beads, a chicken foot, a fertility symbol, weird animal tails. There&rsquo;s no </p><p>telling where he got those, and it might have been lunch!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;In the first film, Will Turner was a blacksmith with a crush on the Governor&rsquo;s daughter. Now he&rsquo;s </p><p>matured and has a more exciting look,&rdquo; continues Rose. &ldquo;Orlando and I got together and had a bit of a </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>32 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>back-and-forth, and I thought we would make Will look a little more sophisticated. For a good deal of the </p><p>film he&rsquo;s wearing an olive-green leather pirate coat that makes him look more powerful.&rdquo; Says Bloom, </p><p>&ldquo;Penny has done an amazing job of taking Will to another level and loosening him up. The leather coat </p><p>we chose for Will to wear is kind of like a biker jacket for pirate times. Doing swordfights and getting wet </p><p>in a long leather coat has posed a few challenges, to say the least, but it&rsquo;s worth every moment because </p><p>Penny&rsquo;s vision for Will, and all of the characters, has helped them come alive.&rdquo; Bloom&rsquo;s main costume, it </p><p>might be added, includes a cream embroidered waistcoat which Rose constructed using antique table </p><p>linens found in Paris, a perfect example of her determination to use whatever works to accomplish her </p><p>design goals. </p><p>&ldquo;Keira has at least three different looks in DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST,&rdquo; Rose continues, &ldquo;because </p><p>Elizabeth is really changing and maturing as well. Keira is very gung ho and will have a go at anything, </p><p>so she really took to the boy&rsquo;s clothing that she wears for part of the film. She also wears a beautiful </p><p>wedding gown, but we only see it drenched in the rain!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Having worked with Penny on &lsquo;Pirates&rsquo; and &lsquo;King Arthur,&rsquo; I feel like I&rsquo;ve spent my life with her, and I </p><p>love it,&rdquo; says Knightley. She is, in the best possible way, a perfectionist. One of my favorite parts of the film </p><p>is before we start, having costume fittings with Penny and seeing her in charge of hundreds and hundreds </p><p>of costumes. Yet, as soon as you get into her </p><p>fitting room, she just cuts right to it. If you&rsquo;ve </p><p>got a button that&rsquo;s two millimeters out of </p><p>place, Penny will move it. If something needs </p><p>a bit of embroidery to be brought out, she </p><p>sees it immediately. She&rsquo;s a forceful lady, and </p><p>one that I&rsquo;m very glad to have around.&rdquo; </p><p>The wedding gown is a fine example of </p><p>Penny Rose&rsquo;s minute attention to detail. It&rsquo;s </p><p>comprised of a deep-ivory silk and raffia </p><p>fabric embellished with a leaf, floral and fan </p><p>design. Rose used the fabric as is for the </p><p>skirts, but created her own design on the bodice by cutting around and repositioning the raffia details. The </p><p>stomacher (front of the dress) looks almost embroidered, with layer upon layer of this raffia design sewn </p><p>into it. The veil is an ivory silk chiffon, with delicate pearls sewn into the silk, attached to a wired tiara </p><p>that also contains the raffia fabric from the dress. And the petticoat of the dress was actually constructed </p><p>from an antique quilted cotton bedspread from Rome! </p><p>Some of the new characters also enticed Rose to new heights of creativity. &ldquo;I loved doing Tia Dalma, </p><p>which was difficult, because the character lives in a swamp and she&rsquo;s both glamorous and repulsive at the </p><p>same time. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to sit too close to her, yet we still want to feel her power as a woman. I </p><p>thoroughly enjoyed it and working with the lovely Naomie Harris.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I absolutely love everything about how they&rsquo;ve created Tia Dalma,&rdquo; enthuses the beautiful Naomie </p><p>Harris, who is unrecognizable in her full makeup, hair and costume as the mysterious soothsayer. &ldquo;Penny&rsquo;s </p><p>costumes, the makeup that Ve Neill designed, the hair by Martin Samuel. I think it&rsquo;s all absolutely </p><p>fabulous. I didn&rsquo;t recognize myself at all when I looked in the mirror, and that&rsquo;s the way it should be. I </p><p>love the fact that Tia Dalma is such a rugged, earthy, crazy kind of character, because I&rsquo;ve never played </p><p>anything like this before. It&rsquo;s really liberating.&rdquo; </p><p>Although the physical details of Bill Nighy&rsquo;s Davy Jones would be created through computer-</p><p>generated imagery, Rose nonetheless created an actual costume which served as a model for the Industrial </p><p>Light &amp; Magic artists to work from. &ldquo;They photographed Bill in his costume in minute detail, because </p><p>you can&rsquo;t superimpose a concept onto a gray reference suit,&rdquo; she says. </p><p>Rose had previously worked with Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd on &ldquo;King Arthur&rdquo; and was happy to collaborate </p><p>with him again for his role as Bootstrap Bill. And unlike Bill Nighy, Skarsg&aring;rd&rsquo;s costume, makeup and </p><p>hair were shot &ldquo;live&rdquo; on camera, which required key makeup designer Ve Neill, key hairstylist Martin </p><p>THE VOYAGE BEGINS </p><p>33 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE VOYAGE BEGINS </p><p>Samuel and Penny Rose to collaborate on his amazing look, which necessitated the actor to spend some </p><p>three to four hours a day in the makeup and hair trailers, being transformed into his character. </p><p>Neill and Samuel&rsquo;s extensive work would contribute greatly to the film&rsquo;s overall look and atmosphere. </p><p>For example, Ragetti&rsquo;s wooden eye has almost become a character unto itself. Actor Mackenzie Crook has </p><p>to wear not one but two contact lenses for this effect, sandwiched one on top of the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s </p><p>uncomfortable,&rdquo; he admits, &ldquo;but not painful. And it helps the character, because without it, I&rsquo;m just any </p><p>other pirate.&rdquo; Coincidentally, in real life, Crook has never worn contacts, &ldquo;so this is into the deep end,&rdquo; he </p><p>laughs. As for the shocking condition of the pirates&rsquo; teeth&mdash;which would delight contemporary dentists&mdash; </p><p>it&rsquo;s all just carefully designed appliances and paint. </p><p>Also at Disney Studios, the company spent a week shooting on the huge &ldquo;Pantano River&rdquo; set, with Tia </p><p>Dalma&rsquo;s tumbledown but richly decorated tree house as its centerpiece. Filling up almost every inch of the </p><p>240-foot-long, 130-foot-wide Stage 2, this set was a truly magical evocation of a Caribbean swampland </p><p>river, lined with stark, overhanging trees and brush and rickety lean-tos. The set was also the most </p><p>deliberate tip of the hat to the original Disneyland &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rdquo; attraction. &ldquo;I remember as </p><p>a kid watching the episode of &lsquo;The Wonderful World of Color&rsquo; which introduced the &lsquo;Pirates&rsquo; ride,&rdquo; recalls </p><p>Rick Heinrichs, &ldquo;and being totally blown away by it at the time. The opportunity to be involved with </p><p>something that references this is, in my mind, a tribute to designers like Marc Davis and others who did </p><p>such incredible work. It was such a pleasure to be able to do that.&rdquo; </p><p>(In fact, Heinrichs&rsquo; first job in Hollywood was at Disney&rsquo;s WED Enterprises when many of the original </p><p>&ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rdquo; attraction creators were still working there.) </p><p>It was no coincidence, then, that it was this set which drew a visit from the legendary Francis Xavier </p><p>&ldquo;X&rdquo; Atencio, the &ldquo;Disney Legend&rdquo; who wrote the script for the original theme-park attraction&mdash;working </p><p>from concepts and storyboards by another Disney great, Marc Davis&mdash;as well as the lyrics to George </p><p>Bruns&rsquo; music for what is now the world&rsquo;s most famous sea chanty, &ldquo;Yo Ho (A Pirate&rsquo;s Life for Me).&rdquo; The </p><p>DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST company rolled out the red carpet for &ldquo;X,&rdquo; honoring him with his own director&rsquo;s </p><p>chair and with Jerry Bruckheimer, Gore Verbinski, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley and a </p><p>long parade of cast and crew paying due homage. &ldquo;Without this man,&rdquo; spoke Verbinski for one and all, </p><p>&ldquo;none of us would be here right now.&rdquo; </p><p>Tia Dalma&rsquo;s shack is lined from end to end and top to bottom with the bric-a-brac of Tia Dalma&rsquo;s artful </p><p>profession. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done a hoodoo voodoo, scary 1720s-ish bayou interior before,&rdquo; laughs set </p><p>decorator Cheryl Carasik. &ldquo;Gore wanted a lot of texture hung from the ceiling, so we prepped bottles </p><p>encrusted with jewels, along with dried herbs. Inside of the bottles were spiders, eyeballs and mushrooms </p><p>which actually started growing over a </p><p>period of time. And a lot of taxidermy all </p><p>over the place.&rdquo; </p><p>The combined work of Heinrichs, art </p><p>director John Dexter and Carasik was </p><p>inspirational to the actors as well. &ldquo;I think </p><p>one of the nicest compliments I ever </p><p>received was from Johnny when he walked </p><p>into Tia Dalma&rsquo;s and told me that he didn&rsquo;t </p><p>really know what he was going to do in </p><p>there, but there was so much great stuff to </p><p>play with that he was like a kid in a candy </p><p>store. You know, Johnny can take a simple </p><p>little trinket from a desk and turn it into the most amazing prop.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The Pantano River set at Disney was also designed to match the actual location chosen in Dominica </p><p>for the sequence, the Indian River,&rdquo; explains construction coordinator Greg Callas. &ldquo;The bloodwood trees </p><p>that border this river are so extraordinary, and we had to replicate them on stage from steel and car foam </p><p>and plater with silk leaves on them, which required a lot of work. We also built an above-ground tank </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>34 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>above the stage floor, which we filled with half a million gallons of water, which actually created the right </p><p>sense of humidity.&rdquo; </p><p>Following the completion of the Pantano River sequence, the &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; company hopscotched back to </p><p>Universal Studios, where a sneak preview of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Flying Dutchman could be glimpsed in an exact </p><p>replica of its main deck for sequences with Orlando Bloom, Bill Nighy, Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd and actors&mdash; </p><p>clad in similar gray reference suits as that worn by Nighy&mdash;portraying the ship&rsquo;s bizarre crew. </p><p>On to the Caribbean: Return to &ldquo;Vincy&rdquo; </p><p>On February 28, 2005, the cast and crew of DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST packed their bags, kissed their </p><p>loved ones, and wedged themselves into a chartered L-1011 jet bound for the distant West Indies&hellip;and a </p><p>location journey of nearly a year&rsquo;s duration which would prove to be as much of an adventure as anyone </p><p>could have predicted, and as much of a challenge as </p><p>anyone could have imagined. </p><p>First destination: the island republic of St. Vincent </p><p>and the Grenadines, 13 degrees north of the equator. </p><p>Because it&rsquo;s not highly developed for tourism, which is </p><p>one of its great charms, St. Vincent&rsquo;s airport cannot </p><p>contain anything bigger than a two-engine prop </p><p>commuter plane. Thus, the &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; jet had to land on </p><p>the neighboring island of St. Lucia, situated between St. </p><p>Vincent and Martinique, and ferry the company, over </p><p>rough seas for two hours, to their destination. And if </p><p>seasickness was to become something of a motif </p><p>throughout production, the &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; crew had some </p><p>good practice on that initial voyage. </p><p>Meanwhile, a monumental amount of equipment and </p><p>material were already on their way to the islands via air </p><p>and sea in a deployment which again echoed a military </p><p>campaign. &ldquo;Priority equipment went by air,&rdquo; recalls unit production manager Doug Merrifield, &ldquo;but we also </p><p>chartered a freighter, loaded it up with all of our rolling stock and containers, and it sailed to St. Vincent, </p><p>and later to Dominica and then to the Bahamas. It became afternoon entertainment for the island people to </p><p>watch a procession from one end of the island to the other as our equipment came out of the port.&rdquo; </p><p>Some 300 crew members were imported to St. Vincent from Los Angeles, Great Britain and many </p><p>other home bases, with their numbers considerably increased by local islanders also employed in a myriad </p><p>of departments. As St. Vincent lacks large resorts, crew members were housed at 43 different hotels, inns, </p><p>bed and breakfasts, condos and apartments sprinkled across the western part of the island. For many in </p><p>the company, it was old home week, as the first &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; film shot in St. Vincent for nearly two months. </p><p>Also making the journey to the Caribbean was a veritable menagerie trained and accompanied by </p><p>Boone Narr and Mark Harden from Animals for Hollywood, which included two capuchin monkeys, two </p><p>macaws, a dozen goats, three pigs, two white horses, two carriage horses, three dozen chickens, six cows </p><p>and 14 ravens. In the first &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; film, some of the on-screen creatures&mdash;including the Prison Dog, Jack </p><p>the Monkey and Cotton&rsquo;s parrot&mdash;had their moment of stardom, which was about to be repeated. The </p><p>silent Cotton&rsquo;s parrot is actually portrayed by two macaws, spicy and spirited avian creatures appropriately </p><p>named Chip and Salsa. &ldquo;One&rsquo;s a good flyer, the other&rsquo;s a good sitter,&rdquo; notes David Bailie, who portrays the </p><p>tongueless pirate. &ldquo;God, if you heard him squawk! You have no idea what that squawk is like at a two-inch </p><p>range. Your head just rings.&rdquo; </p><p>The Prison Dog, a beloved character both in the original Pirates of the Caribbean attraction and the </p><p>first film, is now played by Chopper, a friendly and unbelievably smart eight-year-old terrier mix. Twister, </p><p>who portrayed the role in &ldquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl,&rdquo; is now enjoying a well-deserved retirement after </p><p>RETURN TO &ldquo;VINCY&rdquo; </p><p>35 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RETURN TO &ldquo;VINCY&rdquo; </p><p>years of film and television work. However, like many stars, Chopper needed time in the makeup trailer </p><p>to correctly align the color of his coat with Twister&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Chopper has an air-conditioned little trailer that he </p><p>stays in, and sometimes he allows me to go inside,&rdquo; says Boone Narr ruefully. &ldquo;Then, on his day off, he </p><p>expects me to run around and take care of him. Usually, I&rsquo;m at his bark and call. He&rsquo;s got me well trained.&rdquo; </p><p>Once again, the beautiful inlet of Wallilabou Bay, due north from the island&rsquo;s small capital of </p><p>Kingstown, would be the locale for both Port Royal and Tortuga exteriors. Rather than take the long and </p><p>winding (and sometimes treacherous) road from Kingstown to Wallilabou, most in the company preferred </p><p>to shuttle there on the water, a beautiful journey which skirted the lush shoreline dotted with palm trees, </p><p>banana plantations, mountains often shrouded by clouds and brightly colored little houses. Some </p><p>landlubbing crew members spent more time </p><p>on the water in the first weeks of Caribbean </p><p>filming than they had in their entire lives, </p><p>careening back and forth from one of the </p><p>three starting points in and around </p><p>Kingstown to Wallilabou, enjoying the </p><p>warm tropical breezes, sunshine and </p><p>spectacular views. Of course, there was the </p><p>occasional downpour and heavy ocean </p><p>swells to deal with as well. </p><p>If someone with no connection or </p><p>knowledge of DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST </p><p>found themselves sailing into Wallilabou </p><p>during filming, they would have felt like they had slipped into a time tunnel and out the other end. The </p><p>clock had seemingly been turned back nearly 300 years to the days when European hegemony over the </p><p>Caribbean was constantly being challenged by the pirates who freely roamed the waters. Rick Heinrichs </p><p>and his team re-created Port Royal in even greater detail than the first film, with the added structures of </p><p>the East India Trading Company dock and offices. Anchored in the bay was an impressive array of period </p><p>vessels, dominated by the 169-foot, full-rig H.M.S. Bounty, which in DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST is seen as </p><p>the Edinburgh Trader. </p><p>The Bounty, like its real-life namesake, has had an extraordinary history of its own. She was built for </p><p>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&rsquo;s 1962 version of </p><p>&ldquo;Mutiny on the Bounty,&rdquo; which starred </p><p>Marlon Brando, Trevor Howard and </p><p>Richard Harris. The first ship ever built </p><p>from the keel up especially for a motion </p><p>picture, construction of the Bounty began in </p><p>Lunenburg, Nova Scotia in February 1960, </p><p>and spent seven months being constructed </p><p>with more than 400,000 board feet of </p><p>lumber in the Smith and Rhuland Shipyard </p><p>before sailing for Tahiti and the production </p><p>of the blockbuster feature. Although the </p><p>historical Bounty was 85 feet long, its </p><p>cinematic reconstruction was 118 feet in length so as to allow the cameras more free movement during </p><p>shooting, and her total height from deck to the top of the mainmast is 103 feet. For &ldquo;Mutiny on the </p><p>Bounty,&rdquo; the ship made the 7,327-mile voyage from Lunenburg to Tahiti via the Panama Canal in 33 </p><p>sailing days. Forty-three years later, the Bounty, under Captain Robin R. Walbridge, would be required to </p><p>sail a mere 2,096 statue miles (1,821 nautical miles) in 14 days from Bayou La Batre&mdash;where she was </p><p>being refitted and repainted as the &ldquo;Edinburgh Trader&rdquo;&mdash;to St. Vincent, with stops along the way in </p><p>Miami, Florida and Mayaguez, Puerto Rico for fuel and provisions. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>36 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bounty was joined in Wallilabou Bay by several more &ldquo;picture boats&rdquo; from near and far, under the </p><p>supervision of marine coordinator Dan Malone, assistant coordinator Bruce Ross and picture boat </p><p>coordinator Will White and their team, who were aided and abetted by boat captains, water safety </p><p>personnel, technicians, sailmasters and handlers, the rigging crew under Courtney Andersen, and </p><p>dockmaster Douglas &ldquo;Kino&rdquo; Valenzuela, who was often like a waterbound traffic director. Among them </p><p>were: Sloop Providence, a 110-foot topsail fighting sloop, a replica of Rhode Island&rsquo;s first naval vessel, </p><p>seen in DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST as the &ldquo;Perseverance&rdquo; (the Providence departed its Rhode Island home </p><p>for the Alabama shipyard in a blizzard in January 2005 and sailed from Bayou La Batre to St. Vincent in </p><p>a swift 15 days); St. Peter, a 74-foot schooner from Antigua; and Unicorn, a 145-foot barque from its home </p><p>base of St. Lucia, portraying &ldquo;Terpsichore.&rdquo; The support flotilla in &ldquo;Walli&rdquo; included 12 support boats of </p><p>various kinds, not to mention some dozen British longboats faithfully reconstructed from original 18thcentury plans. </p><p>The primary set in the new and improved Port Royal was Lord Cutler Beckett&rsquo;s imposing headquarters, </p><p>with a huge map of the world clearly dictating his &ldquo;today, the Caribbean; tomorrow, the world&rdquo; philosophy. </p><p>&ldquo;We were revisiting the Port Royal set from &lsquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Rick Heinrichs, &ldquo;and </p><p>the challenge was to let the audience know they were in the same place, but also that some period of time </p><p>had passed. Ironically, the original set was still there at Wallilabou two years after they shot the first film, </p><p>and we were going to use what was left. Not two months before we shot there on DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, </p><p>a tremendous surge came up and knocked the remaining sets into the water. So we had to do a complete </p><p>reconstruction.&rdquo; </p><p>On the East India Company dock, set </p><p>decorator Cheryl Carasik and her assistants </p><p>created an array of cargo and goods. &ldquo;We </p><p>researched all of it, trying to imagine what </p><p>they would be importing and exporting. We </p><p>had special ivory tusks&mdash;not the real thing, </p><p>of course&mdash;molded in Los Angeles, because </p><p>ivory was highly coveted at that time. We had </p><p>tea boxes, silk, chickens in cages, bundles. At </p><p>the last minute, Gore wanted a little fishing </p><p>village off to the side of where Lord Cutler </p><p>Beckett&rsquo;s office was on the Port Royal set, so </p><p>I actually went to the next village from Wallilabou Bay and saw how they dried their fish on mats made </p><p>of sticks and bamboo. We bought fishing nets from them, as well as about 40 fresh fish!&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it,&rdquo; says Tom Hollander of his days of filming in Wallilabou Bay. &ldquo;Only in </p><p>this production can you turn around, look out of the window of the set, and see 850 people pulling up rigging </p><p>on a huge old ship, with another ship sliding in behind it. It&rsquo;s hyper-real, in a way. The production design is </p><p>wondrous, the level at which they&rsquo;re working is remarkable. We just wander into the sets and go, &lsquo;Oh yeah, </p><p>this looks good,&rsquo; but obviously the most enormous kinds of work go into all this detail, and scale that I&rsquo;ve </p><p>never seen before. These people are all experts at what they do, it&rsquo;s the most inspired sort of creativity.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The sets for this film support everything you do,&rdquo; adds Jonathan Pryce, &ldquo;because the authenticity and </p><p>attention to detail are quite extraordinary. When we shot the scene in Beckett&rsquo;s Port Royal office with me </p><p>and Tom Hollander, normally that would be a kind of fairly intimate scene probably shot inside of a studio </p><p>soundstage. But in our film, you look out of the window and there&rsquo;s a whole world of life on the dockside </p><p>going on. Ships are being loaded. Bananas are going up and down the gangplank. Boats are coming in and </p><p>out. It&rsquo;s a great approach to filmmaking. It&rsquo;s a great mix of old-fashioned filmmaking and modern </p><p>technology.&rdquo; </p><p>Typical of the film&rsquo;s attention to minute detail was the enormous amount of goods that spilled out from </p><p>property master Kris Peck&rsquo;s truck like a cornucopia. At one point, Peck and assistant propmaster Michael </p><p>Hansen had eight prop trucks in all four countries in which DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST was filmed, waiting to </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>RETURN TO &ldquo;VINCY&rdquo; </p><p>37 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ADVENTURES IN DOMINICA </p><p>supply whatever necessary to appropriately outfit an actor, extra or stuntplayer. Much of Peck&rsquo;s work was </p><p>done in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs&rsquo; art department or, if there were mechanics involved, with special </p><p>effects and other technical divisions. For the pistols, swords, daggers and other weaponry, Peck worked </p><p>closely with armorer Kelly Farrah, an expert in the field who&rsquo;s also quite an historian, as well as historical </p><p>adviser Peter Twist, who served in the same capacity on the first film. Although many of the weapons are </p><p>replicas or realistically fabricated from latex, Captain Jack Sparrow&rsquo;s sword is the real 18th-century deal </p><p>(although obviously, less lethal versions were used for the swordfighting sequences). &ldquo;We have 300 swords, </p><p>and they were all manufactured for this movie,&rdquo; notes Peck. &ldquo;The pirates&rsquo; swords are down, dirty and </p><p>grungy. We have dress swords for characters like Commodore James Norrington and Governor Weatherby </p><p>Swann. Our Flying Dutchman crewmen have swords that are encrusted with oceanic life.&rdquo; </p><p>Perhaps the most important prop of all, however, was the titular object&mdash;the dead man&rsquo;s chest itself, </p><p>designed with intricate nautical motifs. </p><p>&ldquo;Gore made it very clear to us that since </p><p>this was the title that was going to be on </p><p>every billboard, poster, bus-stop bench and </p><p>grocery store line, he wanted us to get it as </p><p>right as possible,&rdquo; says Peck. &ldquo;This </p><p>integrated more departments than any prop </p><p>I&rsquo;ve ever worked on. The writers, the </p><p>illustrators, the production designer, the </p><p>sculptors, the molders and then onto the </p><p>prop shop for the mechanics. It had to look </p><p>unbreakable, like a cast-iron skillet.&rdquo; </p><p>As it was on the first go-round, the </p><p>shooting in &ldquo;Walli&rdquo; was the biggest show in town for Vincentians. Just outside of the gates which ran </p><p>across the perimeter of the set from the main road, hundreds of people were just &ldquo;limin&rsquo;,&rdquo; island patois for </p><p>&ldquo;hanging out,&rdquo; chatting, partying and peering at the grand spectacle. From a distance, the huge helium </p><p>lighting balloons prepared by chief lighting technician Rafael Sanchez and his team, suspended in the </p><p>night sky, presented a surreal sight to islanders and tourists alike. &ldquo;Vincys&rdquo; are fiercely proud of their </p><p>country and took an almost proprietary joy in the fact that one of the most successful films in history had </p><p>been partially filmed on their small but vibrant island&hellip;and now it was happening all over again. </p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pirates&rsquo;&mdash;Our Movie!&rdquo; was the headline of an article written by St. Vincent lawyer Vynnette A. </p><p>Frederick for a local newspaper: &ldquo;&lsquo;Pirates&rsquo; brought Hollywood home,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;It put money in our </p><p>coffers, brought jobs for our people, and above all else, we now have the right to brag that St. Vincent and </p><p>the Grenadines, just like Trinidad and Jamaica, can be considered a &lsquo;movie location.&rsquo; Every time you drive </p><p>along the Leeward Coast, it is almost impossible not to look out to the horizon and hope for a glimpse of </p><p>the Black Pearl.&rdquo; </p><p>Beware of Falling Coconuts: Adventures in Dominica </p><p>So little known is the &ldquo;isle of beauty, isle of splendor,&rdquo; as its national anthem justly boasts of the </p><p>Commonwealth of Dominica, that some personal effects equipment of the company wound up in the more </p><p>familiar, but very far-flung, Dominican Republic! Only 29 miles long and 16 miles wide, with a </p><p>population of 71,000 souls, the former British colony&mdash;wedged between the French islands of </p><p>Guadeloupe to the north and Martinique to the south&mdash;has become an exciting new destination for </p><p>adventurous eco-tourists, but is hardly developed for mass tourism&hellip;or, for that matter, filmmaking on a </p><p>grand scale. </p><p>But after scouting the magisterial visual sites of the island, Gore Verbinski was determined that </p><p>Dominica would provide the majority of the land-based Caribbean backdrops for DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, </p><p>and Jerry Bruckheimer was willing to back his director up so as to give the film a completely fresh look. </p><p>38 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We selected Dominica as a major location because it&rsquo;s beautiful and virtually untouched,&rdquo; notes </p><p>Bruckheimer. &ldquo;Because it has such a jagged coastline, they can&rsquo;t get cruise ships in, which prevents the </p><p>island from becoming overly developed. You&rsquo;re not seeing the same landscapes, jungles and mountains as </p><p>you have in other movies. Dominica is one of the most picturesque places in the world, but totally </p><p>undiscovered by filmmakers.&rdquo; Verbinski and production designer Heinrichs decided that Dominica would </p><p>serve as location for two major settings in DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST: the humorously terrifying native </p><p>island and Isla Cruces, both wholly fictitious settings located only in the imagination of the filmmakers. </p><p>A large amount of the DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST action sequences take place on those locations, which </p><p>meant that actors and stunt players would be </p><p>performing their daring feats in difficult </p><p>environments and intense heat. Perfect for a </p><p>pirate movie! </p><p>&ldquo;Dominica is a gorgeous island, but </p><p>some of the amenities aren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; explains </p><p>Jerry Bruckheimer. &ldquo;We employed a lot of </p><p>people on the island, and they were brilliant </p><p>and wonderful to work with. But if a piece </p><p>of equipment breaks down, it takes at least </p><p>two days to get it replaced from off-island, </p><p>so we had daunting production challenges. </p><p>The hotels weren&rsquo;t exactly fancy, but </p><p>everybody bonded together. It was like going to camp. A lot of cast and crew lived in cabins, slept in </p><p>mosquito netting and had dinners on the beach. We really had to make do.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;If Gore found a location that was inaccessible, that was usually his favorite one,&rdquo; laughs executive </p><p>producer Bruce Hendricks. &ldquo;Dominica is what the Caribbean looked like 200 years ago. You needed the </p><p>wildness and natural beauty that some of the more offbeat and remote places, like Dominica, offer. Gore, </p><p>like any great director, pushes you to go a step beyond. The great ones have to be leading the charge up </p><p>the hill, they have to be the ones with the vision to push frontiers and boundaries, both artistically and </p><p>technically. A rational person would not go there, and they wouldn&rsquo;t take along 500 of their closest friends </p><p>and hundreds of tons of equipment. It takes a purpose and single-mindedness to pull something off like </p><p>that, and Gore is all of that, and more.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Dominica doesn&rsquo;t have a history of big film production,&rdquo; adds Caribbean production supervisor Tom </p><p>Hayslip. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve hosted documentaries and nature films, but in terms of being able to handle the amount </p><p>of people we had to bring in&mdash;just the accommodations alone&mdash;was a challenge for the island.&rdquo; Adds first </p><p>assistant director Peter Kohn (who later handed the reins of that position to second A.D. Dave Venghaus </p><p>when the time came close for his wife to give birth to their new child), &ldquo;Dominica has its own weather </p><p>system. It rains in one part of the small island, and not in the other, and somehow it always seemed to rain </p><p>on us!&rdquo; </p><p>Dominica would present massive challenges for Rick Heinrichs and construction coordinator Greg </p><p>Callas. &ldquo;The first time I saw those locations, I was wondering how we were going to do it,&rdquo; admits Callas. </p><p>&ldquo;The island is small, but because of the road conditions it can take you three hours to get from one end to </p><p>the other. Logistically, it was incredibly difficult, but we had to satisfy the wants and needs of Gore. The </p><p>art department worked very hard to design things that would fit into certain spaces, and then we had to get </p><p>to those spaces. Because supplies are so limited on islands like Dominica, we had to bring in everything, </p><p>like an entire hardware store: every nail, piece of wood, sack of cement and plaster, gallon of paint. The </p><p>equipment we take for granted, like scissor lifts, boom lifts and forklifts, don&rsquo;t really exist in Dominica, so </p><p>we imported them from other countries in the Caribbean and South America. We implemented a lot of old-</p><p>school construction, because we didn&rsquo;t have the luxury of the 21st century there.&rdquo; </p><p>DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST began shooting in Dominica smack in the middle of a campaign for the </p><p>island&rsquo;s prime ministry so heated that it made the last U.S. elections look like a polite tea party. &ldquo;You </p><p>ADVENTURES IN DOMINICA </p><p>39 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ADVENTURES IN DOMINICA </p><p>figure that a remote Caribbean island would be nice and quiet,&rdquo; says actor Kevin R. McNally. &ldquo;But on the </p><p>first night I was in Dominica, I went to bed at about ten at night, and all of a sudden hell broke loose in </p><p>the street. They started campaigning at midnight and continued until 7:00 in the morning with whistles, </p><p>rattles, music, cars revving up and down the street. Back home in England, there&rsquo;d be, perhaps, a man in </p><p>a suit coming around once during the campaign at 4:00 in the afternoon so he doesn&rsquo;t disturb your tea.&rdquo; </p><p>But the film&rsquo;s company had much else on their minds other than whether or not incumbent Roosevelt </p><p>Skerrit or challenger Edison James would win (by the way, it was Mr. Skerrit who emerged the victor). </p><p>For cast and crew, the great challenges were defying the island&rsquo;s unpredictable weather, with intense heat, </p><p>humidity and sudden rain showers and thunderstorms, circumnavigating the perilous, narrow mountain </p><p>roads, hardly big enough for two compact sedans traveling in opposite directions let alone 16-wheel </p><p>equipment trucks, avoiding constrictor snakes (non-poisonous but with mighty hugs) and other unfamiliar </p><p>flora and fauna. </p><p>The production team spearheaded the </p><p>creation of an entire infrastructure for the </p><p>DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST company, including </p><p>towers for cellular telephones and wireless </p><p>internet. More than 600 members of the </p><p>&ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; crew invaded a welcoming </p><p>Dominica, which provided some 400 more </p><p>workers to the company working in a vast </p><p>array of behind-the-scenes and on-camera </p><p>positions. And if it&rsquo;s true that an army travels </p><p>on its stomach, the same could be said for a </p><p>movie company. On the biggest shooting </p><p>days in Dominica, caterer Paul Kuzmich and his hard-working crew would have to feed anywhere from </p><p>780 to 840 people. For breakfast alone, the hungry company would consume 1,100 to 1,500 eggs, 100 to </p><p>160 pounds of bacon, 80 loaves of bread, 50 pounds of sausage, 400 pastries and 10 to 12 cases of fruit. </p><p>And except for some delicious local produce, everything else had to be shipped in from the United States. </p><p>Meanwhile, it was incumbent upon craft service maestro Ted Yonenaka and his equally energetic assistant </p><p>Lea Anderson to haul food carts into the most unlikely places to keep the company watered and fortified </p><p>between Kuzmich&rsquo;s meals. </p><p>Filming in Dominica began on Monday, April 18th on the island&rsquo;s Hampstead Beach, a bucolic stretch </p><p>of sand overlooking a glistening turquoise sea on the island&rsquo;s northeast coast, backed by a lush, tangled </p><p>jungle and coconut palm groves. In fact, some of it had been created just for the film, with art director </p><p>William Ladd Skinner bringing in some 7,000 plants, primarily non-edible dasheen and transplanted </p><p>palms. Several sequences were shot in and around Hampstead, including the three-way swordfight </p><p>between Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and James Norrington on a huge, runaway mill wheel, which promises </p><p>to be one of the most complex sequences yet seen on film. Among the dangers of this remarkable scene </p><p>was the fact that heavy coconuts were occasionally dropping from nearly 100-foot-tall palms while it was </p><p>being filmed, with some of the crew donning hardhats and Gore Verbinski wearing a good, old-fashioned, </p><p>&ldquo;Gunga Din&rdquo;-style pith helmet! </p><p>&ldquo;The wheel was a very difficult set piece for all concerned,&rdquo; explains stunt coordinator George </p><p>Marshall Ruge. &ldquo;There were extreme physical demands and a number of safety concerns involved.&rdquo; The </p><p>mill-wheel sequence is a perfect example of the symbiosis between departments that characterized the </p><p>entire production. Recalls Ruge, &ldquo;Many departments and people were involved in making the wheel </p><p>sequence a reality. I specifically worked in collaboration with the special effects and visual effects </p><p>coordinators, production designer, art director, propmaster, construction coordinator, director of </p><p>photography, camera operators and more. But most notably, it was Gore&rsquo;s grand vision, commitment and </p><p>enthusiasm that inspired the sequence for all of us, and I worked closely with him in every aspect to help </p><p>bring it to life.&rdquo; </p><p>40 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The wheel was constructed of steel with </p><p>art-directed layers, weighing more than </p><p>1,800 pounds and reaching 18 feet tall. </p><p>There were two versions, one a &ldquo;cart&rdquo; </p><p>version supported by &ldquo;training wheels,&rdquo; </p><p>with the actual mill wheel pulled by cables </p><p>on a winch system, with camera platforms </p><p>built onto the training wheel cart that </p><p>surrounded it. &ldquo;The other version,&rdquo; notes </p><p>Ruge, &ldquo;was affectionately called the &lsquo;paint </p><p>roller.&rsquo; The wheel was attached to steel tow </p><p>bars and literally towed by a flatbed truck </p><p>that also served as a makeshift camera </p><p>platform at times.&rdquo; </p><p>To enable the wheel to roll more smoothly, paths were created through the jungle, because if the terrain </p><p>were too tough, &ldquo;it made it impossible for the performers to stay on the wheel or maintain the necessary </p><p>hand-eye coordination for the swordfight.&rdquo; </p><p>Before the sequence went in front of the cameras, there were several pre-production rehearsals within </p><p>a five-week span and a series of location rehearsals over the course of three weeks whenever time </p><p>permitted Ruge to muster the three actors and his stunt team. </p><p>&ldquo;Oh boy, I&rsquo;ll never forget the faces on Gore and George when it was time to load me into that massive </p><p>wheel,&rdquo; recalls Johnny Depp. &ldquo;Gore just started laughing, because it was such an absurd and bizarre </p><p>request for grown men to ask of each other: &lsquo;Okay, what we&rsquo;d like to do now is bind you inside the wheel, </p><p>tether you to the walls of this thing, give you a sword, and as the wheel is rolling you&rsquo;re gonna go upside </p><p>down several times.&rsquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was so bizarre that it was completely appealing,&rdquo; Depp laughs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done some really obtuse and </p><p>strange things in this movie, at some point there are no surprises. But because of who Gore and George are, </p><p>and how brilliant they are at their jobs, you have complete trust, which is the whole key to filmmaking.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a truly remarkable sequence that only Gore, Ted and Terry could have come up with and that </p><p>George could have made work,&rdquo; says Orlando Bloom. &ldquo;We spent many days harnessed inside of that wheel, </p><p>doing crazy fights up and down, around and around. It would make a fun ride in an amusement park&hellip;if it </p><p>weren&rsquo;t so uncomfortable.&rdquo; Also occasionally harnessed inside of the wheel doing 360-degree revolutions </p><p>were camera operators Martin Schaer and Josh Bleibtreu, just one of the extremely unusual positions in </p><p>which they and their compatriots often found themselves during the DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST shoot. </p><p>Jack Davenport points out that although there are CGI elements which enhanced the scene, most of it </p><p>was live on-camera. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classical swordfight scene with shots which can&rsquo;t be faked. When you see us </p><p>upside down, with the veins in our forehead popping out, it&rsquo;s real.&rdquo; </p><p>But the boys weren&rsquo;t the only ones who got to have all the fun. The sequences shot in Dominica also </p><p>gave Keira Knightley ample opportunity to flex her action muscles, and the fearless performer was up for </p><p>anything stunt coordinator George Marshall Ruge wanted to throw at her. &ldquo;On the first movie, I was </p><p>begging for a swordfight, but I never got one. This time, I&rsquo;ve got two big ones, and two swords as well, </p><p>so I was very happy.&rdquo; </p><p>A sequence shot both in Dominica and later, the Exumas, called upon Knightley to take swords in hand </p><p>and kick some serious Flying Dutchman crewmen butt. &ldquo;The weather was absolutely boiling, and we were </p><p>in this amazing coconut grove,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;George and his stunt team were completely fantastic. They&rsquo;re </p><p>so patient and really take you through the action one step at a time. I&rsquo;m a huge believer that if this is </p><p>something that my character has got to do, then I want to really know how to do it. And if you&rsquo;re shooting </p><p>an action movie, it&rsquo;s really boring if you don&rsquo;t actually do the action. When you&rsquo;re doing the fight </p><p>sequences, a lot of the time we&rsquo;re having a full run at it, so you can really get into it, and that&rsquo;s fantastic. </p><p>It&rsquo;s nice to feel like you&rsquo;re a part of the team. What George and his people do is invite you into the team. </p><p>ADVENTURES IN DOMINICA </p><p>41 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ADVENTURES IN DOMINICA </p><p>And my stunt double, Lisa Hoyle, is absolutely brilliant.&rdquo; </p><p>As were the other stunt doubles for the stars, including Tony Angelotti, Theo Kypri, Zach Hudson and </p><p>Thomas Dupont, who leapt, fought and achieved truly death-defying feats when common sense (and </p><p>insurance policies) prevented an often-willing Depp, Bloom and Knightley from accomplishing the stunts </p><p>themselves. </p><p>South of the Dominican capital of Roseau </p><p>is an aerie appropriately called High Meadow, </p><p>which, along with a nearby spot overhanging </p><p>the main road called Twin Peaks, was selected </p><p>as the location for the richly and wittily </p><p>designed native village of the &ldquo;Pelegostos,&rdquo; a </p><p>wholly tongue-in-cheek and fictitious creation </p><p>(as is the island they live on) inspired by pirate </p><p>folklore. </p><p>&ldquo;One of the great things that Gore and the </p><p>writers have done with the concept of the </p><p>Pelegostos village,&rdquo; says Rick Heinrichs, &ldquo;is </p><p>to create this wonderful escape episode, which puts the pirates into a completely absurd but funny set of </p><p>circumstances which becomes a comedy of errors. Part of the physical comedy is that the village is set way </p><p>up in the mountains, with the huts on top of different pitons with rope bridges between one and the other. </p><p>The huts themselves are an organic riff on a skull, with eye and mouth holes, and everything brought up into </p><p>a bun at the top. It gives a kind of animus to the entire village. </p><p>&ldquo;The overall look of the Pelegostos and their environment is an example of a lot of early-on design </p><p>exploration and consultation between Gore, Penny Rose, Cheryl Carasik, Ve Neill and Martin Samuel&rsquo;s </p><p>makeup and hair departments and myself,&rdquo; Heinrichs continues. &ldquo;We were exploring a lot of different avenues </p><p>to go with the natives, and we ended up with this kind of crazy pastiche which is completely imaginary.&rdquo; </p><p>And imaginative. Throughout the film, Ve Neill and Martin Samuel&mdash;both of whom were nominated </p><p>for Academy Awards&reg; for their work on the first &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; film&mdash;headed large teams of some of the </p><p>industry&rsquo;s most accomplished makeup and hair artists to transform perfectly reasonable human beings into </p><p>gnarly unwashed pirates, foppish, bewigged aristocrats and, in the case of the Pelegostos, wildly painted, </p><p>tattooed and accessorized natives. Some 130 members of the great Kalinago Nation, the original </p><p>inhabitants of many Caribbean islands (including Dominica), participated as extras in these scenes, </p><p>thoroughly enjoying their brush with stardom with good humor and a sense of fun at the film&rsquo;s </p><p>inventiveness (numerous other Kalinagos worked on the production in various occupations as well). </p><p>There was even an invented language for the Pelegostos called &ldquo;Umshoko&rdquo; that was developed by </p><p>dialect coach Carla Meyer and UCLA linguist Peter Ladefoged. &ldquo;Gore didn&rsquo;t want the natives to be </p><p>identified as anything in particular,&rdquo; says Meyer. &ldquo;So Peter drew from several international languages, </p><p>mixed with Pig Latin and English words spelled backwards.&rdquo; A few examples of this brand-new tongue? </p><p>&ldquo;Rah rah rah fi fi&rdquo; means &ldquo;big, big, big fire.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bugo&rdquo; means &ldquo;please.&rdquo; &ldquo;Kamino&rdquo; means &ldquo;come back.&rdquo; </p><p>The Pelegostos village is a highly inventive pastiche of primitive designs laced with a mordant sense </p><p>of humor. In addition to the twined branches which compose the native huts, much of the village is </p><p>constructed and decorated with the materials left over from the Pelegostos&rsquo; enemies&hellip;that is, bones and </p><p>other residue. Instead of beaded curtains in the entrance of the circular doorways to give their inhabitants </p><p>some privacy, they&rsquo;re fabricated with small bones instead. Skulls are a major motif, used in all sorts of </p><p>ways that Martha Stewart never even imagined (but might very well admire). The long and very rickety-</p><p>looking rope bridge linking one side of the village to the other looks treacherous&mdash;in fact, feels </p><p>treacherous when walking over it and viewing the sheer 60-foot drop below&mdash;but it&rsquo;s a marvelous illusion. </p><p>In fact, strong steel pilings supported the bridge, making it as safe as crossing the Golden Gate. </p><p>Construction coordinator Greg Callas actually imported a construction team from Las Vegas which has </p><p>built suspension bridges at theme parks and zoos throughout the world. </p><p>42 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;For the Pelegostos huts, we had to build a shell, a superstructure, of very lightweight material to get </p><p>its initial shape,&rdquo; explains Callas. &ldquo;Then we manufactured some fiberglass skins to put over the top that </p><p>looked like roots and tree limbs. Then we wrapped the whole thing with real roots and tree limbs, so these </p><p>huts became incredibly heavy when we had to move them.&rdquo; To get the trucks up to the Pelegosto village </p><p>location, Callas had to build a 15-degree road up the hillside. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no road in Dominica that&rsquo;s 15 </p><p>degrees,&rdquo; he notes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s almost straight up! It&rsquo;s pretty radical, but we got all our trucks and crew up </p><p>there, we even got portable toilets up there. One of the local Dominican contractors was incredible in </p><p>helping us accomplish that feat.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;What goes through my mind when I remember the Pelegostos village is 385 skulls,&rdquo; laughs Cheryl </p><p>Carasik. &ldquo;On a location like that, it just becomes your daily life. It was so beautiful, and the resources were </p><p>so magnificent, that you just became part of that set. The local people we hired were so fantastic. We had </p><p>two guys who didn&rsquo;t miss a beat, they were really enthusiastic. We&rsquo;d say that we needed some vines to </p><p>wrap on the joints of Pelegostos furniture that we&rsquo;d made, and off they&rsquo;d go into the bush and come back </p><p>two hours later with an armful of them.&rdquo; </p><p>A section of the comedy-action village sequence, in which Will Turner and other Black Pearl pirates </p><p>are imprisoned in large circular cages made of human bones (which were actually fabricated from latex </p><p>and foam), was shot in Dominica&rsquo;s remarkable TiTou Gorge, part of the magnificent Morne Trois Pitons </p><p>National Park in Dominica&rsquo;s south-central </p><p>interior. The icy waters necessitated the </p><p>crew to don wetsuits, and matters were not </p><p>helped when drenching storms threatened to </p><p>derail the day&rsquo;s filming&hellip;but as many </p><p>pointed out, hey, it&rsquo;s a rainforest! &ldquo;Just </p><p>when I was thinking that I had forgotten </p><p>what it was like to be cold in sizzling hot </p><p>Dominica, &lsquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rsquo; has a </p><p>way of granting your every wish,&rdquo; says </p><p>Kevin R. McNally. &ldquo;So for the scene in </p><p>which the bone cage drops into a gorge, they </p><p>found the coldest water in Dominica and </p><p>kept us there for two days! But TiTou Gorge was a fantastic place, only 10 feet wide and a sheer drop </p><p>from the rock face to the beautiful, clear, cold water that we were in.&rdquo; </p><p>The bone-cage scene was another singular event which required the expertise of a whole range of </p><p>departments, including, of course, stunt coordinator George Marshall Ruge. &ldquo;The reality of putting people </p><p>into these things, rolling them down hills, off cliffs, swinging between cliff walls, proved extremely </p><p>problematic. How do you build a cage that&rsquo;s structurally sound but light enough for people to pick it up </p><p>and run with? There was a lot of research and development, and we came up with various versions of the </p><p>cage. One made of lightweight foam to run with, another built from more substantial materials for rolling. </p><p>&ldquo;The running joke was that if you&rsquo;re in the cage, you don&rsquo;t come out unbattered and unbruised,&rdquo; </p><p>continues Ruge. &ldquo;It was pretty difficult to navigate with six people and 12 legs sticking out of this thing, </p><p>but we got it done.&rdquo; </p><p>And then there was Captain Jack Sparrow&rsquo;s mad dash down the beach to escape from a highly agitated </p><p>group of islanders, which was filmed on Hampstead Beach. &ldquo;It was utterly exhausting,&rdquo; admits Johnny </p><p>Depp. &ldquo;Two hundred people dressed as natives chasing me down the shoreline on the beach while in full </p><p>Jack Sparrow regalia. It felt like days and days of that. But the end result was worth it.&rdquo; </p><p>The Indian River, a gorgeous stretch of shallow water flowing into the ocean at Portsmouth on the </p><p>northeast part of Dominica, &ldquo;portrayed&rdquo; the Pantano River, which our (anti) heroes must navigate to reach </p><p>Tia Dalma&rsquo;s treehouse. The Indian River&mdash;which was actually explored by Christopher Columbus in the </p><p>15th century&mdash;is lined with beautifully gnarled terra carpus officinalis (bloodwood) trees, whose roots </p><p>sometimes spread up to 20 feet. This is the real-life location which was re-created on the Pantano River </p><p>ADVENTURES IN DOMINICA </p><p>43 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ADVENTURES IN DOMINICA </p><p>set constructed months before on Stage 2 </p><p>at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. With </p><p>the art department&rsquo;s contribution of </p><p>wooden shacks on the banks of the river, </p><p>the location took on the same feeling as </p><p>both the stage set and the swamp area of </p><p>the &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rdquo; ride. &ldquo;We </p><p>prefabricated those shacks in our </p><p>warehouse, disassembled them, put them </p><p>on these little boats, took them out to the </p><p>locations and set them up in a couple of </p><p>days,&rdquo; explains Greg Callas. </p><p>Because of the Indian River&rsquo;s </p><p>ecological sensitivity, all cast, crew and equipment had to be sent upriver in boats which were either </p><p>manually rowed or utilized electric motors only (no outboards), taking upwards of 45 minutes to an hour </p><p>to reach the filming area. Once again, stormy weather interrupted filming, but the skies ultimately cleared </p><p>enough to allow Gore Verbinski and the stars to complete their designated work. And for anyone heading </p><p>back upriver at dark after wrap, the massive fireflies doing circle eights in the night sky reminded one </p><p>again of the ride that started it all. </p><p>Atop a ridge with a magnificent unspoiled view of the Caribbean, Verbinski and Bruckheimer </p><p>discovered another wonderful location as a backdrop for the spectacular three-way swordfight in Vielle </p><p>Casse, which is situated on the island&rsquo;s northern tip. It&rsquo;s here that Rick Heinrichs designed a ruined, </p><p>abandoned church and adjacent graveyard on Isla Cruces, and the broken-down mill wheel which </p><p>becomes a runaway vehicle. &ldquo;When we were scouting back in October 2004,&rdquo; recalls production manager </p><p>Doug Merrifield, &ldquo;we were literally going all the way around the island with the Dominican Coast Guard. </p><p>At one point we had transferred into a small inflatable craft, and we suddenly looked up at this fabulous </p><p>site. Some of us jumped over the sides and swam to shore, and then walked the location.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The location is like a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the ocean,&rdquo; explains Greg Callas. &ldquo;I asked, </p><p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the equipment going to go?&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that, just build the set.&rsquo;&rdquo; It took Callas </p><p>and company four months to construct the dilapidated church, which stands at the height of a six-story </p><p>building. Forty U.S.-based workers were joined by another 40 Dominican laborers. &ldquo;What a hard-working </p><p>people the Dominicans are,&rdquo; praises Callas. &ldquo;They gave us everything they had and were a big asset.&rdquo; </p><p>The fieriest location on Dominica&mdash;which is saying something of a place where the mean temperature </p><p>during filming usually hovered around 93-95 degrees Fahrenheit&mdash;Vielle Casse is on the dry side of the </p><p>island, hence little cloud cover and a merciless sun with nary a breeze coming off the water to offer blessed </p><p>relief. For many days of filming in Vielle Casse, the heat index sent the temperatures soaring well over </p><p>100 degrees. Depp, Bloom and Davenport&mdash;as well as Bruckheimer, Verbinski and the entire company&mdash; </p><p>had to grin and bear it, sweating through the sword-swinging action. </p><p>To access the Vielle Casse location, one actually had to walk down a 30-degree-graded road from the </p><p>main thoroughfare, which was not accessible by most vehicles. The downhill walk in the intense heat wasn&rsquo;t </p><p>so bad&hellip;but going up again, especially after a 12-hour day of sizzling in the tropical sun, was something else </p><p>again. &ldquo;This is all part of the &lsquo;Pirates&rsquo;fitness program,&rdquo; said Merrifield. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a gym membership. </p><p>You just need to work on &lsquo;Pirates of the Caribbean.&rsquo; Gore and Jerry will get you into great shape!&rdquo; </p><p>The physical rigors obviously presented nearly impossible challenges to director of photography </p><p>Dariusz (Darek) Wolski and his crew, as well as his longtime associates, key grip Mike (Pop) Popovich </p><p>and chief lighting technician Rafael (Raffi) Sanchez. &ldquo;Darek is a brilliant artist,&rdquo; states Jerry </p><p>Bruckheimer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked with him a number of times, not only on the first &lsquo;Pirates&rsquo; movie, but also </p><p>&lsquo;Crimson Tide&rsquo; and others. He&rsquo;s very quick, gets things done, and does very complex lighting in a minimal </p><p>amount of time.&rdquo; </p><p>Wolski knew what the challenges were on DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST and faced each one of them with </p><p>44 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>insurmountable energy and true grit, along with his entire crew, which included units both under the sea </p><p>(headed by Pete Zuccarini) and in the skies above (led by David B. Nowell). &ldquo;You just have to understand </p><p>that you don&rsquo;t have complete control over the elements, and once you accept that, you can get creative,&rdquo; </p><p>says the cinematographer. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re dealing with forces of nature&mdash;the sun going in different </p><p>directions, clouds coming in, wind blowing&mdash;there are just so many variables. You have to be flexible, and </p><p>maybe come up with an idea at the last minute. There&rsquo;s so much beauty in coincidence. I don&rsquo;t believe in </p><p>rules. I believe in intuition. No matter how many discussions, storyboards of pre-visualizations were </p><p>created, we were still dealing with things that we couldn&rsquo;t conceive and we had to adapt constantly.&rdquo; </p><p>Wolski utilized the full panoply of equipment available to contemporary filmmakers, some of which </p><p>was specifically invented for DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST. Richard Jones, a resourceful member of Rafael </p><p>Sanchez&rsquo;s grip department, designed and built a complex camera platform, mounted on a crane, and </p><p>capable of holding an entire Super Technocrane. Together, the unit stood at 80 feet tall, right up to the </p><p>highest mast of the Edinburgh Trader and thereby giving Verbinski and Wolski freedom to film the Kraken </p><p>attack from any conceivable angle. But Wolski also had no problem scaling down to the basics when the </p><p>scene called for it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re basically using every tool to get what we want, but when it comes to simple </p><p>performance pieces, we can do a lot of it handheld, or with a simple dolly move. But then you have shots </p><p>which are bigger than life, like when Captain Jack falls 300 feet down through three hanging bridges while </p><p>attached to a pole.&rdquo; </p><p>Following the completion of nearly eight tough but rewarding weeks of filming on the island on May 26th, </p><p>the cast, crew and their island hosts enjoyed what was humorously called the &ldquo;Dominica Survivor Party.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;One of the best things we do in our industry is to travel the world, but we don&rsquo;t do it as tourists, it&rsquo;s </p><p>almost as if we become semi-locals,&rdquo; says Lee Arenberg. &ldquo;Dominica is an incredibly beautiful place, but </p><p>it&rsquo;s definitely off the beaten path, and to find yourself living that way for a few months will change your </p><p>life and inspire you. It may have been some of the hardest living, because we all like to have a nice bed, </p><p>a little cable T.V., internet access and the like. But sometimes you&rsquo;ve just got to do the best you can, and </p><p>I think that once we got through that part of the journey, we all realized just how special that was.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Please Do Not Feed the Iguanas&rdquo;: The Exumas, and an L.A. Sojourn </p><p>By this point in production, the crew had become not unlike pirates themselves, albeit of a kinder, </p><p>gentler nature. The Jolly Roger was proudly flown from many a production vehicle and support crafts, </p><p>several crew members sprouted tattoos and sported pierced ears or noses, wore head scarves and </p><p>bandanas, and several proudly wore silver or gold skull-and-crossbones rings especially designed by </p><p>makeup artist Joel Harlow. </p><p>The Bahamas, in times past, had seen the likes of such legendary pirates as Henry Jennings, Henry </p><p>Morgan, Edward &ldquo;Blackbeard&rdquo; Teach, Charles Vane, Stede Bonet, Captain Benjamin Hornigold, Woodes </p><p>Rogers, &ldquo;Calico Jack&rdquo; Rackman, Captain John Wyatt, Thomas Austis, Henry Every, Richard Worley, </p><p>Samuel Belamy and Bartholomew &ldquo;Black Bart&rdquo; Roberts. But the Bahamas hadn&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; yet&hellip;for </p><p>it was about to receive a long visitation from Captain Jack Sparrow and company! </p><p>From Dominica, the DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST company flew to the Exumas, one of the southernmost </p><p>chains in a pearly string of some 700 islands which comprise the Bahamas. &ldquo;I think the Exumas were the </p><p>most beautiful of all the islands,&rdquo; says Jerry Bruckheimer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got these white beaches and sand bars, </p><p>gorgeous aquamarine water, just amazing to look at. When you see it on screen you won&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s real, </p><p>you might think it was digitally created. But that&rsquo;s actually the way it is.&rdquo; Here, a sand spit of almost pink, </p><p>fine sand called White Cay was discovered, serving as yet another location for the three-way swordfight </p><p>and other sequences. White Cay was only accessible by water, so the company was required to drive </p><p>southeast from the hotel zone and board one of many boats which brought them some 30 minutes later to </p><p>a floating base camp comprised of two 200-foot barges, tethered together, on which one could find actors&rsquo; </p><p>trailers, equipment trucks, catering tent, tables and chairs, an entire floating base of operations. From here, </p><p>one had to travel in a small Carolina Skiff or shallow draft inflatable craft to make a wet beach landing on </p><p>45 </p><p>THE EXUMAS, AND AN L.A. SOJOURN </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>THE EXUMAS, AND AN L.A. SOJOURN </p><p>the cay. Gore Verbinski required 360-degree </p><p>angles on the cay, hence the necessity of </p><p>keeping it clear of trucks, vehicles and </p><p>equipment. The company could only shoot in </p><p>specific tidal conditions, which limited the </p><p>number of hours available for filming. &ldquo;What </p><p>an organization that was,&rdquo; recalls assistant </p><p>director Peter Kohn, &ldquo;for everybody to be </p><p>able to have their breakfast burrito, get their </p><p>equipment, load it onto another boat and then </p><p>be transported to an island. You don&rsquo;t get </p><p>experiences like that&hellip;it&rsquo;s just phenomenal.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Please do not feed the iguanas,&rdquo; </p><p>implored the call sheets while shooting on White Cay, so as to protect the friendly sole inhabitants and </p><p>indigenous population from the affectionate attentions of the company. (The company called upon </p><p>wildlife biologist Joseph A. Wasilewski, based in Homestead, Florida, to make certain the iguanas weren&rsquo;t </p><p>disturbed.) Human and reptile respected each other&rsquo;s space, but the iguanas seemed as fascinated by the </p><p>filming as the DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST company were by them. The crew also received an unexpected </p><p>visitation from another, somewhat more threatening creature while filming on White Cay. &ldquo;A hundred </p><p>yards from land a little nurse shark showed up,&rdquo; recalls marine coordinator Dan Malone. &ldquo;Most of the </p><p>crew wasn&rsquo;t familiar with sharks, so they found it a little unnerving, but we told them, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about </p><p>them, they&rsquo;re just curious. They&rsquo;ll swim by and check you out.&rsquo; Production shut down for a minute while </p><p>everyone focused on the shark, and then we got back to work.&rdquo; </p><p>A scheduled summer break in filming brought the company back to hearth and home in early June </p><p>following the initial spate of shooting in the Exumas, resuming once again in early August back in Los </p><p>Angeles. Back at the former Marineland site in Palos Verdes, Verbinski continued directing the Pelegostos </p><p>island bone-cage sequence, and this time, some of the stars&mdash;including Orlando Bloom, Kevin R. </p><p>McNally, David Bailie and Martin Klebba&mdash;found themselves in a bone cage set loose from a 100-foottall crane, swinging freely in long, wide arcs. Bloom definitely enjoyed the ride, while some others were </p><p>looking a bit green in the gills when emerging from their &ldquo;E&rdquo;-ticket adventure. </p><p>&ldquo;The bone-cage sequence was crazy,&rdquo; recalls Bloom. &ldquo;The first time we dropped from the crane, nobody </p><p>knew what to expect, and it was like a bungee-jump feeling&hellip;your stomach completely leaves you. Believe </p><p>me, moments like that will never be forgotten!&rdquo; </p><p>Palos Verdes also saw the construction of a </p><p>100-foot-long, 50-foot-high cliff wall, also used </p><p>in the bone-cage sequence, which was required </p><p>to be maneuverable from a 90-degree angle </p><p>down to a 45-degree angle. &ldquo;We had to build a </p><p>steel wall that&rsquo;s hinged,&rdquo; explains Greg Callas, </p><p>&ldquo;and incredibly heavy. To make it work, I have </p><p>two 160-ton cranes to move this wall from point </p><p>A to point B, and then brace it off.&rdquo; </p><p>Filmed at Disney Studios were sequences </p><p>inside of Davy Jones&rsquo; extraordinary Flying </p><p>Dutchman captain&rsquo;s cabin. &ldquo;Davy Jones&rsquo; cabin certainly has a very operatic feel to it,&rdquo; says Rick Heinrichs. &ldquo;He </p><p>plays an enormous pipe organ that we had to design and build from scratch. It plays as a normal organ would, </p><p>but the pipes have grown fantastically into all of these underwater shapes, with steam coming out of them. The </p><p>organ itself has shell and sea life textures, backed up to the window of the stern. We also designed a painting </p><p>above the organ keys which has a weirdly sweet and romantic feel to it. That was intentional, because we were </p><p>trying to give Davy Jones&rsquo; character some pathos, because he&rsquo;s mourning the loss of a lost love.&rdquo; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>46 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Back to the Bahamas, Hurricanes and All </p><p>After several weeks of filming a spectacular opening sequence for &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean III,&rdquo; the </p><p>company once again boarded a chartered jet on September 19th and flew off to its fourth and final location </p><p>destination of Grand Bahama Island to begin work at The Bahamas Film Studio at Gold Rock Creek. The </p><p>start-up studio provided the company with the necessary space in which to shoot extensive seagoing </p><p>sequences with the numerous ships assembled for DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, including a limitless horizon </p><p>from a semi-enclosed marina for filming, as well as temporary floating barges in which the vessels could </p><p>be safely moored, or filmed upon, when not out at sea. A vast, empty concrete space which had been </p><p>vacant for years now became the production&rsquo;s base camp for months, housing a motley conglomeration of </p><p>some 57 assorted trailers and equipment trucks shipped in from Los Angeles, 72 freighter containers </p><p>utilized to hold and store material of every kind, 11 cranes and Condors and four office trailers. One of </p><p>the shipping containers was humorously and creatively converted into &ldquo;Prop the Pyrate,&rdquo; through which </p><p>extras walked through to become suitably &ldquo;propped out&rdquo; as pirates, including swords, pistols, baldrics and </p><p>other lovely accoutrements of the profession. &ldquo;Enter a lubber, leave a pyrate,&rdquo; announced a sign painted </p><p>in period style at the entrance of the container. &ldquo;Come board, grab your gear, and set course to the sea </p><p>through the exit!&rdquo; And indeed, the blue-green Atlantic was no more than 10 steps away from that exit. </p><p>Following an initial week of literal smooth sailing in beautiful weather, Mother Nature threw her first </p><p>knuckleball at the DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST company for a week thereafter, drenching Grand Bahama </p><p>Island in buckets of torrential rain and stirring up the seas until the Atlantic resembled a Jacuzzi with the </p><p>switch turned on &ldquo;high.&rdquo; &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re working on water,&rdquo; explains Bruckheimer, &ldquo;the weather changes </p><p>constantly, the wind shifts, the waves go in different directions, which makes it difficult to work. We&rsquo;re </p><p>very conscious of safety, and we had our marine unit move the vessels, shepherd us back and forth from </p><p>land to sea, get food out to cast and crew working on the ships and take them back to shore at night. Along </p><p>with our marine unit, we also had expert divers.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The boat-to-boat transfers were the most dangerous thing we dealt with on a daily basis,&rdquo; notes Dan </p><p>Malone. &ldquo;On one day, while holding the Black Pearl against the wind, we had a four-foot swell rolling in </p><p>there, and although we&rsquo;ve designed these nice little ramps that we use to bring people on board from the </p><p>inflatable boats, you still worry about that misstep. If someone tries to step from the inflatable to the Pearl </p><p>without judging the waves and listening to the captain, they can take a header between the boat and the </p><p>ramp. Thankfully, we never had a serious accident.&rdquo; </p><p>On rougher days, many in the crew were reminded of the familiar amusement-park rides in which a </p><p>pirate ship swings back and forth, faster and faster&hellip;except, this time, it was real! </p><p>But for the actors filming on the new, improved Black Pearl, a sense of nostalgia was tinged with a </p><p>new excitement. &ldquo;I think the new Pearl is all of our favorites,&rdquo; says Keira Knightley. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much more user-</p><p>friendly than the first one, because it&rsquo;s bigger. I remember on the first film, you couldn&rsquo;t seem to get out </p><p>of the way and there was no way to sit. The ship is very beautiful, which is always helpful when you&rsquo;re </p><p>fighting Krakens.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The first and second Black Pearls are both beautiful works of art,&rdquo; adds Lee Arenberg, &ldquo;but the actual </p><p>physical filming on the new ship is much more exciting. You&rsquo;re actually moving at speed, and when you </p><p>come around doing these passes at the Flying Dutchman, it&rsquo;s just thrilling. We&rsquo;re on a seaworthy craft now, </p><p>as opposed to the barge that sort of bobbed in the water and would take forever to line up. The bar has </p><p>been raised.&rdquo; </p><p>The weather and sea conditions presented more challenges to Gore Verbinski and company as they </p><p>filmed, with great detail and a plethora of stunts and action, the attack of the monstrous Kraken on the </p><p>Edinburgh Trader. For this purpose, Rick Heinrichs&rsquo; art department constructed an exact replica of the </p><p>Bounty without, of course, the &ldquo;guts&rdquo; of the ship. Stunt coordinator George Marshall Ruge and his second </p><p>in command, Dan Barringer, put their fearless team through their paces, with major contributions from </p><p>the special effects and visual effects departments. </p><p>The Kraken is inspired by a thousand years of seagoing mythology, with, perhaps, a tip of the hat to </p><p>BACK TO THE BAHAMAS </p><p>47 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BACK TO THE BAHAMAS</p><p>the famed giant squid in Walt Disney Pictures&rsquo; own 1954 classic &ldquo;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.&rdquo; The </p><p>word &ldquo;Kraken&rdquo; was first heard in 12th-century Norwegian legends, referring to a creature the size of an </p><p>island, and usually depicted as a giant squid. In these legends the Kraken&rsquo;s many arms or tentacles could </p><p>reach to the top of a ship&rsquo;s mainmast and could without any great effort capsize a full-rig vessel. So great </p><p>was the creature&rsquo;s fame that it was even immortalized in British poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;The </p><p>Kraken,&rdquo; scribed in 1830. In the 20th century, stamp collectors could find the Kraken&rsquo;s image on postages </p><p>from such diverse countries as Canada and even the Commonwealth of Dominica, one of the DEAD </p><p>MAN&rsquo;S CHEST host countries. </p><p>For the Kraken attacks on both the </p><p>Edinburgh Trader and Black Pearl, stunt </p><p>coordinator George Marshall Ruge and </p><p>his team of stuntplayers and riggers had </p><p>to create multiple ratchets which </p><p>simulated people getting whacked or </p><p>pulled into the air by the monster&rsquo;s </p><p>tentacles. &ldquo;The reality of doing the stunt </p><p>rigging on these ships is that there&rsquo;s a </p><p>mast here, or ropes hanging down there, </p><p>or grates in the middle of the deck. So we built an overhead system on both of the ships that ran their full </p><p>lengths in between the yardarms, with travelers on the cables which allowed us to move pick point </p><p>virtually anywhere in between the masts. We were on water, so everything was moving, but the multilayered system gave us the ability to move things around pretty freely.&rdquo; </p><p>Among the stunt heroes was Orlando Bloom himself, who, as often as feasible (and as he would be </p><p>permitted by production), performed his own feats of derring-do, sometimes more than 30 feet up in the </p><p>rigging of the high masts of the Edinburgh Trader. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one scene in which I&rsquo;m on the mast, jump into </p><p>a sail, slash it with a dagger and slide down. This is like real Errol Flynn stuff, which is every boy&rsquo;s dream. </p><p>I really do feel like I am living a lot of these boyhood dreams on a movie like this. And I&rsquo;ve trained hard to </p><p>be fit and agile enough to do things like this so I don&rsquo;t hurt myself. It&rsquo;s a major part of who Will Turner is.&rdquo; </p><p>The Kraken is masterfully brought to life in DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST by a phalanx of visual effects </p><p>artists at Industrial Light &amp; Magic, the live-action elements meticulously calibrated with the visual effects </p><p>plans. &ldquo;The Kraken sequences were extensively pre-visualized,&rdquo; notes visual effects supervisor John </p><p>Knoll, &ldquo;and we were literally shooting specific pieces to conform to that animatic blueprint. The Kraken </p><p>scenes are technically very complex, because there&rsquo;s a lot of interaction with water and we see shots </p><p>looking down the whole of the ship, with a dozen tentacles swarming around, picking characters off the </p><p>deck. Putting the composites together are very difficult&hellip;every shot takes months of effort.&rdquo; </p><p>The mandate set by Jerry Bruckheimer and Gore Verbinski for DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST was for ILM </p><p>to raise the bar higher once again, as they had on the first &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; film. DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST required </p><p>three times as many visual effects shots as did &ldquo;The Curse of the Black Pearl,&rdquo; which itself represented a </p><p>quantum leap of visual effects technology. </p><p>Despite the fact that the film traffics in pure fantasy, Verbinski was absolutely insistent that the </p><p>unbelievable look believable in every way. &ldquo;CGI is not a verb,&rdquo; Verbinski has been known to say. Rather, </p><p>he sees it as a tool to be used to embellish and enhance. </p><p>&ldquo;Because Gore has been through the process and understands every nut and bolt of what ILM is </p><p>doing,&rdquo; says visual effects supervisor Charlie Gibson, &ldquo;he can put that aside and just charge forward, </p><p>knowing that ILM will eventually be able to catch up and meet his vision somewhere near the very end </p><p>of the schedule. What&rsquo;s unique about the visual effects in this film, for me, is how freely Gore is able to </p><p>use what ILM can offer. The net result of that confidence and understanding is that the discussions move </p><p>on past the technical to the creative.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Gore is great visually,&rdquo; notes visual effects supervisor John Knoll&mdash;who served in the same capacity </p><p>on the first film and works alongside fellow ILM supervisor Bill George on DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST&mdash; </p><p>48 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;and he has a really strong technical background. Gore comes in with very strong opinions of how he </p><p>wants to do things. This film is not just a rehash of the last one. Gore and the writers have come up with </p><p>a lot of really great and fresh ideas.&rdquo; Knoll and George sought to free Verbinski up as much as possible to </p><p>shoot as he wanted without worrying about the visual effects which would come later. &ldquo;I have enough </p><p>confidence in our crew that we could track those cameras, and that if we need to put computer-generated </p><p>characters behind the live actors, we can just rotor that edge and not have to worry about having a blue </p><p>screen in there.&rdquo; </p><p>Although Davy Jones and his crew are digitally enhanced, &ldquo;it was important to have good actors cast </p><p>at playing those roles,&rdquo; notes Knoll. &ldquo;Because a really good actor brings soul to the whole process, and it </p><p>helps everybody on the set. Gore works with the actor in a very normal way like every other part of the </p><p>picture. Bill Nighy and all of the actors playing Davy&rsquo;s crew really own the roles. They&rsquo;ve thought the </p><p>characters through, and they&rsquo;re bringing everything they can to these CG characters.&rdquo; </p><p>Because Verbinski insists that fantasy look as authentic and real as possible, ILM developed new </p><p>technologies for DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, including the creation of Davy Jones and his crew. Explains Bill </p><p>George, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying something new and challenging on this project. In the past, when you&rsquo;ve done a </p><p>CG character&mdash;especially one that&rsquo;s supposed to move like a human&mdash;you shoot a clean plate that the </p><p>character will go into, and at a later time on a different stage you shoot what&rsquo;s called motion capture. This </p><p>is a process where you&rsquo;ve got a number of cameras, perhaps 12 or 15, all focused on a character who&rsquo;s </p><p>wearing a black skintight suit with little markers on it. Then, as that character moves, using the cameras </p><p>the computer triangulates where each point is in space and therefore the movement. You can then take that </p><p>animation file and plug it into a character so that it will move as the actor did on stage. It&rsquo;s a very long </p><p>and laborious process. </p><p>&ldquo;The technology has evolved to the point now where we&rsquo;re trying to capture that exact same data by </p><p>only using two video cameras as we&rsquo;re shooting the actual shot,&rdquo; continues Bill George. &ldquo;The difference </p><p>now is that instead of splitting it into two separate shoots, it&rsquo;s happening all at the same time. There&rsquo;s a lot </p><p>of advantages to that. In the first &lsquo;Pirates&rsquo; film, when an actor was fighting one of the cursed skeleton </p><p>pirates, he was basically fighting with thin air, pretending that someone was there. Now the &lsquo;live&rsquo; actors </p><p>are actually interacting with a real person, which is much more realistic and natural.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;The impact of this is really profound,&rdquo; says Charlie Gibson, &ldquo;because so much of the character </p><p>animation is about nuances of performances, particularly Bill Nighy. The film is edited based on very </p><p>subtle facial expressions, attitudes, and even the less tangible things, like his mood and the feeling behind </p><p>his eyes, all of these things that you get from a great actor. Bill is a fountainhead of amazing variety. He </p><p>never repeats himself, there&rsquo;s always some interesting aspect to his performance.&rdquo; </p><p>Nighy himself was highly amused by the process in which ILM converted him into the fully tricked-</p><p>out Davy Jones. &ldquo;The first thing they did was cyber-scan me, which they did in a sort of mystery truck </p><p>lined with screens and computers. Then, on set, I wore a gray suit which had reference points comprised </p><p>of white bubbles and strips of black and white material, so that when they come to interpret your physical </p><p>performance, they&rsquo;re better placed to do so. I don&rsquo;t understand any of it, but I&rsquo;m currently the world-record </p><p>holder for playing the organ with an imaginary octopus beard. This is pioneering stuff, state-of-the-art.&rdquo; </p><p>Knoll and George were a tag team on set, either one present at all times on all locations, as the other </p><p>one returned to ILM headquarters in San Francisco to work with their team of artists and technicians on </p><p>bringing it all to life. &ldquo;One of our tasks on set was to deal with improvisation and change,&rdquo; notes Knoll, </p><p>&ldquo;because no matter how much you&rsquo;ve thought these things out in advance, the situation is always different </p><p>in front of the camera. Or there&rsquo;s an opportunity to do something that&rsquo;s creatively better, which might </p><p>mean that the camera will be in a different position, or that there&rsquo;s some other technical challenge that you </p><p>didn&rsquo;t anticipate. It&rsquo;s important that someone from visual effects is there to make decisions quickly.&rdquo; </p><p>Also helping to keep things atmospheric throughout the shoot on every location were special effects </p><p>coordinators Michael Lantieri and Allen Hall. Whether creating steam and smoke rings from Davy Jones&rsquo; </p><p>massive musical organ, smashing full-sized ships in half, firing off batteries of cannons, or laying down </p><p>massive amounts of smoke and fog around the Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman, these physical &ldquo;in-</p><p>BACK TO THE BAHAMAS </p><p>49 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BACK TO THE BAHAMAS</p><p>camera&rdquo; effects were no less magical than that conjured by the ILM experts. So much fog was required </p><p>for the sequences shot in the Bahamas that Hall had two large boats equipped with large jet pulse engines, </p><p>not to mention an actual aircraft jet engine mounted on a larger craft. &ldquo;We actually bought out the world&rsquo;s </p><p>supply of fog fluid for this movie,&rdquo; Hall </p><p>admits. </p><p>Dealing with Grand Bahama&rsquo;s fickle </p><p>weather became almost routine for </p><p>Verbinski and company, but what was </p><p>looming in October could never have been </p><p>predicted. Although Caribbean production </p><p>supervisor Tom Hayslip had written a </p><p>detailed, 27-page Hurricane Preparedness </p><p>Plan in September, it was, of course, hoped </p><p>that it would never have to be implemented. </p><p>But on Tuesday, October 18th, it became </p><p>clear that Tropical Storm Wilma&mdash;having </p><p>just been promoted to Hurricane Wilma&mdash;was about to make a sudden right turn away from the Yucatan </p><p>Peninsula and head directly toward Florida and, just 50 miles beyond, Grand Bahama Island. As the </p><p>humidity increased and the clouds began to build, production hurriedly began preparing for the worst. It </p><p>was a terrible irony that just two weeks earlier, the pre-production crew of another Jerry Bruckheimer </p><p>production, &ldquo;D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu,&rdquo; had to be evacuated from New Orleans as the monstrous Hurricane Katrina </p><p>stormed its way toward the Gulf. Now, Bruckheimer and his production team began organizing the huge </p><p>task of securing the production facilities as much as possible while ensuring the safety of the company. </p><p>Grand Bahama Island is flat as a pancake, has no high ground, and had taken huge hits in September </p><p>2004 from both Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne. When the company went to sleep on the night of October </p><p>18th, Wilma was only a category-one hurricane. By the next morning, it had graduated not only to a </p><p>category five, but also to new status as the most powerful hurricane in recorded history, with sustained </p><p>winds of 175 and gusts up to 215 miles per hour. &ldquo;We were alerted about a week prior to the hurricane </p><p>and made the decision to pull everybody out just in case it picked Grand Bahama Island,&rdquo; recalls </p><p>Bruckheimer. &ldquo;And fortunately for us, we got everybody out, locked down our ships in the harbor and had </p><p>them all battened down. We had only minor </p><p>damage, considering what could have </p><p>happened.&rdquo; </p><p>After raising havoc in Florida, </p><p>Hurricane Wilma smashed into Grand </p><p>Bahama Island on October 24th as a </p><p>category two, with sustained winds of 100 </p><p>miles per hour. It was a mercifully quick </p><p>visitation, lasting just four hours, and </p><p>although the studio site was spared much </p><p>damage, Grand Bahama&rsquo;s West End and the </p><p>village of Eight Mile Rock were badly hit. In just three-and-a-half days, sand deposited by the storm surge </p><p>was removed from the base camp site, washed-out roads rebuilt and the entire base camp reformed as if </p><p>nothing had happened. The Grand Bahamians, with their characteristic fortitude and courage, had </p><p>survived yet another in a long string of hurricanes that have bedeviled their island during storm season. </p><p>And DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST and &ldquo;Pirates III&rdquo; continued filming on the Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman </p><p>and a floating set of a ship scuttled after its encounter with the Kraken, until another planned break for </p><p>the holidays in December. </p><p>Returning to the Bahamas in the second week of January 2006, the filming of DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST </p><p>finally wrapped with the conclusion of Kraken attack sequences, and, ironically, shooting Captain Jack&rsquo;s </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>50 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>introduction at the start of the film as one of the last scenes to be shot. The weather on Grand Bahama </p><p>had now cooled considerably, enough so that parkas had to be donned for night shooting. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been </p><p>through every possible circumstance of weather,&rdquo; said Johnny Depp at that juncture in the shoot. &ldquo;When </p><p>we started out down in St. Vincent and then on to Dominica, there was sweltering, intense heat and </p><p>humidity. Now it&rsquo;s touching between 30 and 50 degrees at night. It&rsquo;s pretty strange. Also, we&rsquo;re still </p><p>shooting scenes that we started a year ago. You&rsquo;ve really got to keep all the dots connected at all times.&rdquo; </p><p>And although Verbinski and company remained until the end of February working on &ldquo;Pirates III&rdquo; </p><p>sequences, DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST&mdash;almost exactly one year to the day filming had began in Burbank&mdash; </p><p>was a wrap. </p><p>On that final day on location in the Caribbean, the company gathered in the catering tent in the Grand </p><p>Bahama base camp and was addressed by Bruckheimer, Verbinski and their production team, which </p><p>included some of the following salient details: </p><p>&bull; The production&rsquo;s travel coordinator had booked over 10,000 one-way tickets, not including charter </p><p>flights. </p><p>&bull; 475 cell phones were distributed in Dominica. </p><p>&bull; 550 barrels had been built by set dressing. </p><p>&bull; 178 barrels of smoke had been used by the special effects department. </p><p>&bull; Over 6,000 batteries were used by the sound department. </p><p>&bull; At one time there were over 200 walkie-talkies being used on set by various departments. </p><p>&bull; Between ship rigging, marine, set decoration and props, production used over 463,000 feet of </p><p>rope&hellip;which translates into 87 miles! </p><p>&bull; Between the first, second and element units, 335 miles of film had been shot&hellip;enough to stretch </p><p>from Los Angeles to Sacramento. </p><p>&bull; Catering served over 200,000 meals. </p><p>Now it was time for cast and crew to return home to loved ones and process a year&rsquo;s worth of </p><p>memories. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been amazing at every level,&rdquo; says Johnny Depp. &ldquo;You become kind of like a weird gypsy </p><p>family, a traveling circus.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Being away from family and friends for </p><p>long periods of time can be difficult, but we </p><p>have created our own kind of family </p><p>environment, and there&rsquo;s a great atmosphere </p><p>on set,&rdquo; notes Orlando Bloom. &ldquo;The hours </p><p>can be long and the work is definitely </p><p>challenging, but we all know what we&rsquo;re </p><p>working on, a once-in-a-lifetime </p><p>opportunity. It&rsquo;s quality entertainment, </p><p>family fun, with a great story and plotline </p><p>that everyone can enjoy. It doesn&rsquo;t take </p><p>itself too seriously, which frees it up to </p><p>everything that it wants to be as a movie, and more. I feel like I&rsquo;m living many dreams, all at the same </p><p>time, whether it&rsquo;s swinging from ropes, rolling in a bone cage, sliding down sails, or kissing a beautiful </p><p>girl. The actual work that goes into it is really difficult, and it&rsquo;s made to look easy on camera. But it&rsquo;s so </p><p>much fun doing it. I feel very lucky, because it&rsquo;s a great group of people, and there&rsquo;s a lot of thought and </p><p>care that goes into the whole process of making this movie. </p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine it will ever be done like this again,&rdquo; concludes Bloom. &ldquo;It sort of feels like the end of </p><p>an era in terms of making movies this way. And I think we all feel very lucky to be a part of it.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;It was an adventure in the spirit of pirate movies themselves,&rdquo; says assistant director Peter Kohn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s </p><p>not like making the movie&hellip;it&rsquo;s like being in the movie, &lsquo;livin&rsquo; the ride,&rsquo; as one of our T-shirts says.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Audiences are going to get everything that anybody wants when they put their money down to enter </p><p>a cinema,&rdquo; says Bill Nighy. &ldquo;Romance, adventure, thrills, danger, wonder. Things they&rsquo;ve never laid eyes </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BACK TO THE BAHAMAS </p><p>51 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>BACK TO THE BAHAMAS</p><p>on before, worlds they&rsquo;ve never visited before. It&rsquo;s really difficult to pull off an adventure movie that&rsquo;s </p><p>authentic and satisfying and, at the same time, make everybody laugh in the dark at regular intervals.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been in anything as big as this,&rdquo; notes Kevin R. McNally, &ldquo;and you might worry that you </p><p>could get lost in it all. But the great thing about Jerry&rsquo;s production, Gore&rsquo;s direction, and Ted and Terry&rsquo;s </p><p>writing is that what they&rsquo;re most interested in is character. So despite the gigantic sets, the visual effects, </p><p>the spectacle, the real meat of the film is when we all get down, talk, plan, plot and just be pirates together. </p><p>You don&rsquo;t get lost in the sea of organization and logistics.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I have a profound respect for Gore and always have since the first instant we worked together on the </p><p>first film,&rdquo; says Johnny Depp of his &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; director. &ldquo;But on this one, watching what he&rsquo;s had to deal </p><p>with on a daily basis is incredible. With the kind of pressure he&rsquo;s been working under, I&rsquo;ve never seen him </p><p>step outside or lose his composure, or his vision. He just sort of deals and fights his way out of that corner. </p><p>It&rsquo;s pretty miraculous to witness. Gore is one of those directors where, as an actor, you could almost get </p><p>away with not reading the script at all and just sort of trusting his knowledge of the material. He knows it </p><p>that well.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Gore is a phenomenal director,&rdquo; adds Orlando Bloom. &ldquo;When I saw the first movie, I was blown away </p><p>by how he had managed to maintain such incredible integrity with the story and the characters. Gore has </p><p>a tremendous ability to motivate a crew and has a spirit and youthful energy to attack whatever scene we&rsquo;re </p><p>up against, no matter how complex it might be.&rdquo; </p><p>Keira Knightley concurs with her fellow &ldquo;Pirates&rdquo; stars. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how Gore&rsquo;s brain can focus on </p><p>so many different things at once, but it&rsquo;s very impressive. I think it&rsquo;s important that in a film like this, </p><p>which is in the realm of fantasy and dreams, to actually have an emotional core that feels real. And that&rsquo;s </p><p>what I think Gore does&hellip;he always makes it real.&rdquo; </p><p>And all agreed, whether it was another go-round or the first time, that there was nothing like being on </p><p>the set of a Jerry Bruckheimer film. &ldquo;The first film felt very intimate and got more and more grand as </p><p>time went on,&rdquo; says Depp. &ldquo;This one is just totally, utterly Jerry Bruckheimer, which means that it&rsquo;s very </p><p>grand but done with incredible taste. Jerry uses the best guys in the business, and it&rsquo;s impressive.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Jerry has a team of people around him who have the ability to tackle pretty much anything that&rsquo;s asked </p><p>of them by Gore and the screenwriters,&rdquo; adds Orlando Bloom. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a sense of &lsquo;How can we be </p><p>better?&rsquo; that&rsquo;s part of Jerry&rsquo;s attitude toward life and moviemaking: that there&rsquo;s nothing you can&rsquo;t do. It&rsquo;s </p><p>a courageous way to make films, fearless </p><p>and sometimes a little overwhelming.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done three films with Jerry now,&rdquo; </p><p>says Keira Knightley, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s just amazing. </p><p>They&rsquo;re really, really big! The scale of these </p><p>movies is just huge. Jerry has created an </p><p>entire pirate world, and we&rsquo;re all part of it. </p><p>It&rsquo;s fantastic.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Jerry Bruckheimer is one of a kind,&rdquo; </p><p>adds Lee Arenberg. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s truly an </p><p>impresario, because he gives you the tools </p><p>to do what you need to do. His focus is </p><p>super-strong, he has a gold thumb and hires </p><p>great people to work for him. I think that&rsquo;s a true sign of power, giving the trust and respect to the team.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t drift through a Jerry Bruckheimer movie,&rdquo; adds Kevin R. McNally. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come to </p><p>work half-cocked. You see everybody around you up to their full game, and it&rsquo;s really inspiring. He&rsquo;s very </p><p>hands-on, and you know that everything is up to 110 percent.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s strength is that he has no weakness,&rdquo; says Bruce Hendricks. &ldquo;He really understands audience&rsquo;s </p><p>tastes and makes sure that a movie like this is accessible to young and old viewers alike.&rdquo; </p><p>But the work was far from over&hellip;a hiatus from the filming of &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean III&rdquo; was </p><p>required so that Bruckheimer and Verbinski could begin dealing with the myriad post-production </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>52 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>elements, leaping into the cutting room with film editors Craig Wood and Stephen Rivkin as well as </p><p>dealing with visual effects, sound effects, music scoring and a thousand other details required for </p><p>completing DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST in time for its July 7th opening. Walt Disney Imagineering got to </p><p>work on revising the &ldquo;Pirates of the </p><p>Caribbean&rdquo; attraction, scheduled to reopen </p><p>in concert with the new film&rsquo;s premiere. </p><p>Explains Jerry Bruckheimer, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re </p><p>adding some of our iconic characters to the </p><p>ride, which will be thrilling for us to go </p><p>through and see characters that we created </p><p>now become part of the Disney world.&rdquo; </p><p>And, oh yes&hellip;following the theatrical </p><p>opening of PIRATES OF THE </p><p>CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST, </p><p>Bruckheimer, Verbinski and their company </p><p>of latter-day buccaneers would once again </p><p>raise the Jolly Roger high and head back onto sets, soundstages and high seas to complete work on the </p><p>tentatively titled &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean III.&rdquo; </p><p>The Black Pearl will sail again&hellip;and the &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rdquo; odyssey continues! </p><p>ABOUT THE CAST </p><p>JOHNNY DEPP reprises his Academy Award&reg;- and Golden Globe&reg;</p><p>nominated role of Captain Jack Sparrow in PIRATES OF THE </p><p>CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST. Depp also received a British </p><p>Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) nomination and a Screen </p><p>Actors Guild Award&reg; for his portrayal of Captain Jack in &ldquo;Pirates of the </p><p>Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.&rdquo; </p><p>Depp has earned both critical and popular acclaim for his unique </p><p>work in a variety of memorable feature films. Most recently, he </p><p>collaborated with director Tim Burton for the fourth and fifth times, on </p><p>&ldquo;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,&rdquo; for which Depp received a Golden </p><p>Globe&reg; nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical, and &ldquo;Tim </p><p>Burton&rsquo;s Corpse Bride,&rdquo; which received a 2005 Academy Award&reg; </p><p>nomination for Best Animated Film. Based on the beloved Roald Dahl classic, Depp portrayed eccentric </p><p>chocolatier Willy Wonka in &ldquo;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,&rdquo; which opened to impressive critical and </p><p>box-office success internationally. For &ldquo;Tim Burton&rsquo;s Corpse Bride,&rdquo; Depp loaned his voice to the lead </p><p>character of Victor Van Dort in the wildly imaginative film, which was one of last year&rsquo;s most celebrated </p><p>releases.

No other actor in </p><p>the award&rsquo;s history has received so many commendations. </p><p>After playing Saffy&rsquo;s Euro-trash fianc&eacute; in the final episode of &ldquo;Absolutely Fabulous,&rdquo; Hollander went </p><p>on to star opposite Joseph Fiennes and Rufus Sewell in the 1998 film &ldquo;Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and </p><p>Lawrence.&rdquo; He subsequently starred in such features as &ldquo;Bedrooms and Hallways,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Clandestine </p><p>Marriage,&rdquo; Ben Elton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Maybe Baby,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Announcement,&rdquo; Michael Apted&rsquo;s &ldquo;Enigma&rdquo; and Neil </p><p>LaBute&rsquo;s &ldquo;Possession.&rdquo; He also portrayed Osborne Hamley in Andrew Davies&rsquo; BBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wives and </p><p>Daughters.&rdquo; </p><p>Hollander returned to the stage to play the title role of Moliere&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don Juan&rdquo; at Sheffield&rsquo;s Crucible </p><p>ABOUT THE CAST </p><p>59 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ABOUT THE CAST </p><p>Theatre to critical acclaim. He was then handpicked by director Robert Altman to play a leading role in </p><p>&ldquo;Gosford Park&rdquo; with a Screen Actors Guild Award&reg;-winning ensemble cast that included Dame Maggie </p><p>Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, Michael Gambon, Helen Mirren, Richard E.

He </p><p>then portrayed King George V in Stephen Poliakoff&rsquo;s BBC drama &ldquo;The Lost Prince&rdquo; and, in the BBC&rsquo;s </p><p>four-part drama &ldquo;Cambridge Spies,&rdquo; Hollander portrayed the infamous spy Guy Burgess. </p><p>Returning to the big screen, Hollander played the lead role in Paul Abascal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paparazzi,&rdquo; produced by </p><p>Mel Gibson for Icon Productions. The film, which was shot in Los Angeles, co-starred Tom Sizemore, </p><p>Cole Hauser and Robin Tunney. In June 2003, Hollander filmed Richard Eyre&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stage Beauty,&rdquo; costarring Billy Crudup, Claire Danes and Ben Chaplin. Two months later, he started rehearsing for his lead </p><p>role at the Donmar Warehouse in John Osborne&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Hotel in Amsterdam.&rdquo; Directed by Robin Lefevre, </p><p>the play opened to great critical acclaim. </p><p>Remaining on the stage, Hollander next appeared in &ldquo;Picadilly Jim&rdquo; alongside an all-star cast that </p><p>included Sam Rockwell, Tom Wilkinson, Amanda Peet, Alison Janney, Frances O&rsquo;Connor, Brenda </p><p>Blethyn and Hugh Bonneville. He went on to film the role of George Etherege in &ldquo;The Libertine,&rdquo; directed </p><p>by Laurence Dunmore and starring Johnny Depp, John Malkovich, Samantha Morton and Rosamund </p><p>Pike. Hollander received a British Independent Film Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor for this </p><p>performance in 2005. He also co-starred with Keira Knightley, Matthew MacFadyen, Donald Sutherland </p><p>and Brenda Blethyn in his acclaimed role as Reverend Collins in the international success &ldquo;Pride &amp; </p><p>Prejudice.&rdquo; Most recently, Hollander appeared in the ensemble cast of &ldquo;The Darwin Awards,&rdquo; which </p><p>premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. </p><p>LEE ARENBERG (Pintel) has the remarkable ability to morph </p><p>himself into frightening aliens, twisted psychotherapists, lascivious </p><p>entertainment executives and, with &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse </p><p>of the Black Pearl,&rdquo; a scurvy knave of a pirate. Most frequently referred </p><p>to as a character actor, Arenberg maintains a flourishing acting career of </p><p>almost 20 years, spanning television, stage and film. </p><p>Arenberg has appeared in more than 30 movies, including &ldquo;Cradle </p><p>Will Rock,&rdquo; &ldquo;RoboCop 3,&rdquo; &ldquo;Waterworld,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bob Roberts,&rdquo; &ldquo;The </p><p>Apocalypse,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cross My Heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&rdquo; </p><p>Bitten by the acting bug at the age of eight when he appeared in a </p><p>Hebrew school play, the Los Angeles native attended Santa Monica High </p><p>School with &ldquo;brat packers&rdquo; Sean Penn, Robert Downey, Jr., and Emilio </p><p>Estevez and co-wrote a play with Estevez which was directed by Penn. Arenberg&rsquo;s first professional job </p><p>was in 1986 at the Mark Taper Forum in &ldquo;Ghetto,&rdquo; a play directed by Gordon Davidson. Within weeks, he </p><p>was cast in three films, including &ldquo;Tapeheads&rdquo; opposite Tim Robbins and John Cusack. </p><p>Guest appearances on television began in 1987 with the hit sitcom &ldquo;Perfect Strangers&rdquo; and have </p><p>continued with memorable roles such as the parking-space-stealing New Yorker on &ldquo;Seinfeld&rdquo;; the </p><p>murderous rock promoter in &ldquo;Tales From the Crypt&rdquo;; and the notoriously huge studio head, Bobby G., on </p><p>the controversial syndicated comedy &ldquo;Action&rdquo;; as well as roles on &ldquo;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Charmed,&rdquo; &ldquo;Scrubs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Arli$$,&rdquo; &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; &ldquo;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Deep Space Nine&rdquo; and </p><p>&ldquo;Voyager!&rdquo; </p><p>Arenberg credits much of his development as an actor to his participation in the Actors&rsquo; Gang, one of </p><p>Los Angeles&rsquo; oldest theater companies. The Actors&rsquo; Gang was founded by Arenberg in 1981 with Tim </p><p>Robbins and other friends from UCLA. After 20 years as an actor in the group, he recently made his </p><p>writing and directing debut with &ldquo;Foursome,&rdquo; a play about golf, sex and witchcraft. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>60 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before his memorable role as the wooden-eyed Ragetti in &ldquo;Pirates of </p><p>the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,&rdquo; MACKENZIE CROOK </p><p>was probably best known as Gareth Kenan in the multi-award-winning </p><p>BBC show &ldquo;The Office,&rdquo; the highest-rated and fastest-selling comedy in </p><p>Britain. Crook has starred in many hit comedies and was nominated for </p><p>a prestigious British Comedy Award in 2001. </p><p>Crook&rsquo;s other feature films have included &ldquo;Still Crazy,&rdquo; &ldquo;The </p><p>Gathering,&rdquo; &ldquo;Finding Neverland,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sex Lives of the Potato Men,&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Churchill: The Hollywood Years,&rdquo; Terry Gilliam&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Brothers </p><p>Grimm,&rdquo; Michael Radford&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Merchant of Venice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Land of the </p><p>Blind.&rdquo; He also appeared in HBO&rsquo;s highly acclaimed &ldquo;The Life and Death </p><p>of Peter Sellers,&rdquo; which starred &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rsquo;s&rdquo; Geoffrey </p><p>Rush in the title role. During the hiatus between the completion of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: </p><p>DEAD MAN&rsquo;S CHEST and the resumption of filming on &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean III,&rdquo; Crook starred </p><p>on the London stage in the drama &ldquo;The Exonerated,&rdquo; directed by Bob Balaban. </p><p>Born in Kent, England, Crook started out as a stand-up comedian on the British club and theater circuit. </p><p>DAVID BAILIE (Cotton) has worked in the entertainment industry </p><p>for 43 years. He arrived in England from South Africa in 1960 and </p><p>trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He spent most of the </p><p>following 10 years working in theater at the Royal Shakespeare Company </p><p>at Stratford-Upon-Avon and at the Royal National Theatre alongside and </p><p>understudying Sir Laurence Olivier, where he also portrayed Florizel </p><p>opposite Judi Dench&rsquo;s Perdita in &ldquo;A Winter&rsquo;s Tale.&rdquo; </p><p>Since that time, Bailie has continued to work on stage and has also </p><p>expanded his repertoire to include television and film.

Born in Manchester, England, as one of 10 children in a </p><p>working-class family, he caught the acting bug at the age of 12. He left a </p><p>rough inner-city boy&rsquo;s school three years later and took various odd jobs </p><p>before writing a letter to a local repertory theater. Finally granted an </p><p>audition two years later, in 1967, Schofield was accepted on the lowest </p><p>rung of the ladder as student assistant stage manager and was paid all of </p><p>10 dollars a week. There he worked in every department as a propmaker, </p><p>soundman, writer, stage sweeper and teamaker, putting in 14-hour days, </p><p>six days a week. </p><p>After two seasons, Schofield applied to acting colleges and was </p><p>accepted by the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art at the age </p><p>of 19. Following three years at the Academy, Schofield acquired an agent and left school early to pursue </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ABOUT THE CAST </p><p>61 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ABOUT THE FILMMAKERS </p><p>his path as a working actor (30 years later, Schofield maintains the same agent). Schofield&rsquo;s distinguished </p><p>stage career has seen the actor performing some of the great classical roles including Angelo in &ldquo;Measure </p><p>for Measure&rdquo; and Mark Antony in &ldquo;Julius Caesar&rdquo; for the Royal Shakespeare Company and a long </p><p>association with the Royal National Theatre appearing in numerous productions, including &ldquo;The </p><p>American Clock,&rdquo; &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Elephant Man&rdquo; (for which he created the title role), </p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,&rdquo; &ldquo;As You Like It&rdquo; and &ldquo;Plenty.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s also acted on the West End stage </p><p>in both musicals and straight plays. </p><p>Making his feature-film debut in &ldquo;The Dogs of War,&rdquo; Schofield has appeared in a wide range of roles </p><p>in such films as &ldquo;An American Werewolf in London,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Last of the Mohicans,&rdquo; &ldquo;Anna Karenina,&rdquo; &ldquo;The </p><p>Musketeer,&rdquo; &ldquo;From Hell,&rdquo; &ldquo;Superstition,&rdquo; &ldquo;Unstoppable&rdquo; and as Falco in Ridley Scott&rsquo;s Academy Award&reg;</p><p>winning &ldquo;Gladiator.&rdquo; Schofield&rsquo;s television credits are too numerous to mention. </p><p>Schofield&rsquo;s greatest passions in life are his 25-year-long marriage to wife Lally and their children, Fred </p><p>and Blanche. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MARTIN KLEBBA, another veteran of the first &ldquo;Pirates of the </p><p>Caribbean,&rdquo; repeats his role as the diminutive but tough Marty. The native </p><p>of Troy, Michigan, has enjoyed numerous credits in feature films and </p><p>television as both actor and stunt player. His motion-picture credits as an </p><p>actor have included &ldquo;Men in Black II,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Light in the Forest,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cradle 2 </p><p>the Grave,&rdquo; &ldquo;El Matador,&rdquo; &ldquo;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&rdquo; and </p><p>&ldquo;Americano.&rdquo; He was a stunt player in the films &ldquo;The Hand That Rocks </p><p>the Cradle,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Animal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Planet of the Apes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Leprechaun: Back 2 </p><p>Tha Hood,&rdquo; &ldquo;Van Helsing&rdquo; and &ldquo;SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2.&rdquo; </p><p>On television, Klebba is perhaps best known for his role as Randall </p><p>Winston in multiple episodes of &ldquo;Scrubs,&rdquo; and he has also appeared in the </p><p>TV movies &ldquo;Snow White&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Santa Trap,&rdquo; and in the series </p><p>&ldquo;National Lampoon&rsquo;s Gordo&rsquo;s Road Show,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cedric the Entertainer Presents,&rdquo; &ldquo;Andy Richter Controls the </p><p>Universe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mad TV,&rdquo; &ldquo;Just Shoot Me!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Malcolm in the Middle.&rdquo; Klebba starred in the title role as </p><p>tough detective Hank Dingo in Comedy Central&rsquo;s &ldquo;Knee High P.I.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s also a frequent guest on Howard </p><p>Stern&rsquo;s hugely popular radio program. </p><p>ABOUT THE FILMMAKERS </p><p>Working in a wide range of budgets with many of today&rsquo;s top talents, GORE VERBINSKI (Director) </p><p>is considered one of the top visionary directors of his generation. With only five feature films to his credit </p><p>thus far, Verbinski&rsquo;s box-office success totals over $1 billion worldwide. </p><p>&ldquo;The Weather Man,&rdquo; Verbinski&rsquo;s fifth movie, starred Nicolas Cage, Michael Caine, Hope Davis and </p><p>Gil Bellows. Previously, Verbinski directed the immensely successful &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The </p><p>Curse of the Black Pearl,&rdquo; starring Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. </p><p>Released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2003, the film went on to become one of the top-grossing films of </p><p>the year and earned Depp an Oscar&reg; nomination for his performance. Prior to this swashbuckling </p><p>adventure, Verbinski directed the chilling horror film &ldquo;The Ring,&rdquo; starring Naomi Watts, raising the bar </p><p>for fans of the genre around the world. &ldquo;The Ring&rdquo; grossed nearly $130 million domestically and helped </p><p>to make Naomi Watts a household name. Always enigmatic in his choices and willing to cross genres, </p><p>&ldquo;The Weather Man&rdquo; represents Verbinski&rsquo;s first foray into drama. </p><p>Prior to embarking into the world of features, Verbinski was an award-winning commercial director. </p><p>The UCLA graduate also cut his teeth extensively in directing high-profile music videos for such cutting-</p><p>edge artists as Bad Religion and The Crystal Method. </p><p>Verbinski lives with his family in Los Angeles. </p><p>62 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great stories, well told. They can be for audiences in darkened movie theaters or home living rooms. </p><p>They can feature great movie stars or introduce new talent. They can be true adventure, broad comedy, </p><p>heartbreaking tragedy, epic history, joyous romance or searing drama. They can be set in the distant or </p><p>recent past, an only-imagined future or a familiar present. Whatever their elements, though, if they begin </p><p>with a lightning bolt, they are stories being told by JERRY BRUCKHEIMER (Producer), and they will </p><p>be great stories, well told. </p><p>The numbers&mdash;of dollars and honors&mdash;are a matter of often-reported record. Bruckheimer&rsquo;s films have </p><p>earned worldwide revenues of over $13.5 billion in box-office, video and recording receipts. In the 20056 season, he had nine series on network television, a feat unprecedented in nearly 60 years of television </p><p>history. His films&mdash;14 of which have grossed over $100 million domestically&mdash;have been acknowledged </p><p>with 35 Academy Award&reg; nominations, five Oscars&reg;, four Golden Globes&reg;, 43 Emmy&reg; award nominations, </p><p>seven Emmys&reg;, 16 People&rsquo;s Choice nominations, six People&rsquo;s Choice Awards, and numerous MTV </p><p>Awards, including one for Best Picture of the Decade. </p><p>But the numbers exist only because of Bruckheimer&rsquo;s uncanny ability to find the stories and tell them </p><p>on film. He is, according to the Washington Post, &ldquo;the man with the golden gut.&rdquo; He may have been born </p><p>that way, but more likely, his natural gifts were polished to laser focus in the early years of his career. His </p><p>first films were the 60-second tales he told as an award-winning commercial producer in his native </p><p>Detroit. One of those mini-films, a parody of &ldquo;Bonnie and Clyde&rdquo; created for Pontiac, was noted for its </p><p>brilliance in Time magazine and brought the 23-year-old producer to the attention of world-renowned ad </p><p>agency BBD&amp;O, which lured him to New York. </p><p>Four years on Madison Avenue gave him the experience and confidence to tackle Hollywood, and, not </p><p>yet 30, he was at the helm of memorable films like &ldquo;Farewell, My Lovely,&rdquo; &ldquo;American Gigolo&rdquo; and 1983&rsquo;s </p><p>&ldquo;Flashdance,&rdquo; which changed Bruckheimer&rsquo;s life by grossing $92 million in the U.S. alone and pairing </p><p>him with Don Simpson, who would be his producing partner for the next 13 years. </p><p>Together, the Simpson/Bruckheimer juggernaut produced one hit after another, including &ldquo;Top Gun,&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Days of Thunder,&rdquo; &ldquo;Beverly Hills Cop,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bad Boys,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dangerous Minds&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crimson Tide.&rdquo; Box-</p><p>office success was acknowledged in both 1985 and 1988, when the National Association of Theater </p><p>Owners (NATO) named Bruckheimer Producer of the Year. And in 1988, the Publicists Guild of America </p><p>named him, along with Simpson, Motion Picture Showmen of the Year. </p><p>In 1996, Bruckheimer produced &ldquo;The Rock,&rdquo; re-establishing Sean Connery as an action star and </p><p>turning an unlikely Nicolas Cage into an action hero. &ldquo;The Rock,&rdquo; named Favorite Movie of the Year by </p><p>NATO, grossed $350 million worldwide and was Bruckheimer&rsquo;s last movie with Simpson, who died </p><p>during production. </p><p>Now on his own, Bruckheimer followed in 1997 with &ldquo;Con Air,&rdquo; which grossed over $230 million, </p><p>earned a Grammy&reg; and two Oscar&reg; nominations and brought its producer the ShoWest International Box </p><p>Office Achievement Award for unmatched foreign grosses. </p><p>Then came Touchstone Pictures&rsquo; megahit &ldquo;Armageddon,&rdquo; starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, </p><p>Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi. Directed by Michael Bay, it was the biggest movie of 1998, grossing </p><p>nearly $560 million worldwide and introducing legendary rock band Aerosmith&rsquo;s first number-one single, </p><p>&ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Want to Miss a Thing.&rdquo; </p><p>By the end of the millennium, Bruckheimer had produced &ldquo;Enemy of the State,&rdquo; starring Will Smith </p><p>and Gene Hackman and &ldquo;Gone in 60 Seconds,&rdquo; starring Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, both </p><p>grossing over $225 million worldwide; &ldquo;Coyote Ugly,&rdquo; whose soundtrack album went triple platinum; and </p><p>the NAACP Image Award-winning &ldquo;Remember the Titans,&rdquo; starring Denzel Washington. His peers in the </p><p>Producers Guild of America acknowledged his genius with the David O. Selznick Award for Lifetime </p><p>Achievement in Motion Pictures. </p><p>He began the 21st century with triple Oscar&reg; nominee &ldquo;Pearl Harbor.&rdquo; Starring Affleck, Josh Hartnett </p><p>and Kate Beckinsale and directed by Bay, the film was hailed by World War II veterans and scholars as a </p><p>worthy re-creation of the event that brought the United States into the war. In addition to multiple award </p><p>nominations and the Oscar&reg; for Best Sound Editing, it earned over $450 million in worldwide box office </p><p>ABOUT THE FILMMAKERS </p><p>63 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ABOUT THE FILMMAKERS </p><p>and has topped $250 million in DVD and video sales. </p><p>&ldquo;Black Hawk Down,&rdquo; the story of the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, starred Hartnett, Eric Bana and Ewan </p><p>McGregor and was directed by Ridley Scott. The adaptation of the Mark Bowden bestseller was honored </p><p>with multiple award nominations, two Oscars&reg; and rave reviews. </p><p>And then in 2003, Bruckheimer unveiled &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.&rdquo; </p><p>Starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley and directed by Gore </p><p>Verbinski, the comedy/adventure/romance grossed more than $630 million worldwide, making it </p><p>Bruckheimer&rsquo;s highest-grossing film, earning five Academy Award&reg; nominations and spawning two </p><p>upcoming sequels. </p><p>Since then, The Films That Begin With The Lightning Bolt have included &ldquo;Bad Boys II&rdquo;; the raucously </p><p>funny &ldquo;Kangaroo Jack,&rdquo; a family film that won an MTV Award for Best Virtual performance for the </p><p>kangaroo; &ldquo;Veronica Guerin,&rdquo; starring a luminous Cate Blanchett as the Irish journalist murdered by </p><p>Dublin crime lords; and &ldquo;King Arthur,&rdquo; with Clive Owen starring in the revisionist retelling of the </p><p>Arthurian legend. </p><p>In 2004, &ldquo;National Treasure,&rdquo; starring Cage and Sean Bean in a roller-coaster adventure about solving </p><p>the mystery of untold buried treasure, opened to cheering audiences and grossed more than $335 million </p><p>worldwide. </p><p>Teaming for the sixth time with director Tony Scott, Bruckheimer is currently in production on &ldquo;D&eacute;j&agrave; </p><p>Vu,&rdquo; the story of an ATF agent who falls in love with a complete stranger as he races against time to track </p><p>down her brutal killer. The film stars Denzel Washington, Jim Caviezel, Paula Patton and Val Kilmer and </p><p>is scheduled for a late 2006 release. </p><p>Could the master film storyteller make the same magic in 47 minutes for the living-room audience? </p><p>Apparently. As Time magazine recently wrote, &ldquo;The most successful producer in film history&hellip;is on his </p><p>way to becoming the most successful producer in the history of TV.&rdquo; </p><p>Bruckheimer brought the power of the lightning bolt to television in 2000 with &ldquo;C.S.I.,&rdquo; starring </p><p>William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger. It quickly became the number-one show on television, </p><p>averaging 25 million viewers a week and, along with its two spin-offs, &ldquo;C.S.I.: Miami&rdquo;&mdash;distinguished as </p><p>the biggest television series on a global scale in 2005&mdash;and &ldquo;C.S.I.: NY,&rdquo; helped catapult languishing CBS </p><p>back to the top of the broadcast heap. </p><p>Bruckheimer Television broadened its imprint by telling compelling stories and delivering viewers in </p><p>huge numbers with &ldquo;Without a Trace,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cold Case,&rdquo; three-time Emmy&reg; award-winning &ldquo;Amazing Race&rdquo; </p><p>and &ldquo;Close to Home&rdquo; for CBS and &ldquo;E-Ring&rdquo; for NBC. </p><p>In 2006, Bruckheimer was honored with a Doctor of Fine Arts degree from The University of Arizona, </p><p>his alma mater. &ldquo;Bruckheimer is unique in the industry in that his creative vision spans both large and </p><p>small screens. We are pleased to recognize his work through this honor,&rdquo; said Maurice Sevigny, dean of </p><p>the UA College of Fine Arts. </p><p>Bruckheimer has been successful in many genres and multiple mediums because he&rsquo;s a great storyteller. </p><p>Look for the lightning bolt. The best stories are right behind it. </p><p>MIKE STENSON (Executive Producer) is president of Jerry Bruckheimer Films for which he </p><p>supervises all aspects of film development and production.

The group&rsquo;s single Video Killed the Radio Star became a worldwide hit and helped usher in a </p><p>new era of global entertainment as the first music video to be aired on MTV. </p><p>Zimmer entered the world of film music in London during a long collaboration with famed composer </p><p>and mentor Stanley Myers, which included the film &ldquo;My Beautiful Laundrette.&rdquo; He soon began work on </p><p>several successful solo projects, including the critically acclaimed &ldquo;A World Apart,&rdquo; and during these </p><p>years, Zimmer pioneered the use of combining old and new musical technologies. Today, this work has </p><p>earned him the reputation of being the father of integrating the electronic musical world with traditional </p><p>orchestral arrangements. </p><p>A turning point in Zimmer&rsquo;s career came in 1988 when he was asked to score &ldquo;Rain Man&rdquo; for director </p><p>Barry Levinson. The film went on to win the Oscar&reg; for Best Picture of the Year and earned Zimmer his </p><p>first Academy Award&reg; nomination for Best Original Score.

With state-of-the-art technology and a supportive creative </p><p>environment, Zimmer was able to offer film-scoring opportunities to young composers at his Santa </p><p>Monica-based musical &ldquo;think tank.&rdquo; This approach helped launch the careers of such notable composers </p><p>as Mark Mancina, John Powell, Harry Gregson-Williams, Nick Glennie-Smith and Klaus Badelt. </p><p>In 2000, Zimmer scored the music for Ridley Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gladiator,&rdquo; for which he received an Oscar&reg; </p><p>nomination, in addition to Golden Globe&reg; and Broadcast Film Critics Awards, for his epic score.

Choosing selections from his body of work, </p><p>Zimmer performed newly orchestrated concert versions of &ldquo;Gladiator,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mission: Impossible 2,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rain </p><p>Man,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lion King&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Thin Red Line.&rdquo; The concert was recorded by Decca and released as a </p><p>concert album entitled The Wings of a Film: The Music of Hans Zimmer. </p><p>In 2003, Zimmer completed his 100th film score with &ldquo;The Last Samurai,&rdquo; for which he received both </p><p>a Golden Globe&reg; and a Broadcast Film Critics nomination.

Having a keen interest in model making, Knoll </p><p>was mesmerized by the original &ldquo;Star Wars.&rdquo; During a visit to ILM in 1978, he was able to observe </p><p>firsthand the world of visual effects. Inspired to learn more, Knoll attended the University of Southern </p><p>California&rsquo;s Film School and earned a Bachelor of Arts in cinema production, while freelancing as a </p><p>model maker at a variety of Los Angeles-based production facilities. </p><p>During his last year at USC, Knoll took an advanced animation class where he built a motion-control </p><p>system from an Oxberry animation stand, an Apple II computer, a CNC milling-machine controller and a </p><p>bunch of industrial surplus stepper motors. Impressed by the student film generated from this class </p><p>project, ILM hired Knoll as a technical assistant for motion-control photography. Greatly impressed by </p><p>visits to ILM&rsquo;s newly founded computer graphics department, Knoll took up computer graphics as a </p><p>hobby. Teaming up with his brother, who was working on his doctoral thesis in computer vision at the </p><p>University of Michigan, the Knoll brothers created Photoshop in 1987. </p><p>ABOUT THE FILMMAKERS </p><p>69 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>ABOUT THE FILMMAKERS </p><p>BILL GEORGE (Visual Effects Supervisor) joined Industrial Light &amp; Magic in 1981.

                              are on their 36th Anniversary Tour in 2006 . In 1970, Producer Gary Lashinsky created a new family arena attraction, starring The &quot;World Famous&quot; LIPIZZANER STALLIONS.<br /><br /><strong>Many horses and riders were brought</strong> from Europe to perform in this unique family oriented arena attraction. Over the years, twenty-three million people throughout North and South America, Great Britain, Europe, Australia and Hawaii have seen this internationally acclaimed spectacle.<br /><br /><strong>2006 represents the 36th Anniversary</strong> season of The Lipizzaner Stallions. All new music, choreography and routines have been incorporated in this anniversary edition with a major emphasis on the historical background and foundation of the Lipizzaner breed, from its original breeding and use as a horse of war to a horse of nobility and aristocracy to a living form of equestrian art. The show emulates the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, Austria, in its presentation of Lipizzans, and maintains a traditional as well as entertaining performance similar in many ways to what you would see at the Spanish Riding School of Vienna.<br /><br /><strong>Also included in the performance</strong> is a segment called the &quot;Airs Above the Ground.&quot; These are the spectacular leaps and maneuvers, once used by riders in saddle to protect and defend themselves on the battlefield, which are now preserved as an equestrian work of art. When you see the Lipizzans perform, it is like stepping back four hundred years and viewing one of the greatest equine ballets in history.<strong><a onclick="MyWindow=window.open('pics/intropic2.asp','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=center,directories=no,status=yes,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,width=950,height=700'); return false;" href="http://montebubbles.net/blog-mt/#" /></strong> <p align="left"><strong>The Lipizzan is a rare and unique breed;</strong> its history and culture is known worldwide. The Walt Disney movie The Miracle of the White Stallions, depicting General George S. Patton saving them at the end of World War II from certain extinction, created an even greater world-wide interest in the Lipizzaner breed. Had it not been for Patton, there would be no Lipizzans today.&nbsp;</p><p align="left"><strong>Although the Lipizzans star in this presentation,</strong> the ancestral forefather of the Lipizzan, the Spanish Andalusian, is featured in a high school presentation with special wardrobe themed to traditional Spanish music.<br /><br /><strong>Not only is the Andalusian shown in saddle,</strong> but also in a unique presentation where the rider performs all the maneuvers of the Grand Prix Olympic level dressage on the longline, while walking behind the horse and guiding him through his paces.<br /><a onclick="MyWindow=window.open('pics/intropic3.asp','MyWindow','toolbar=no,location=center,directories=no,status=yes,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,width=950,height=700'); return false;" href="http://montebubbles.net/blog-mt/#" /><br /><strong>The current tour features 12</strong> to 14 stallions performing selected maneuvers as described above in an exciting presentation.<br /><br /><strong>The conclusion of the performance</strong> of The Lipizzaner Stallions is the traditional Grand Quadrille, featuring six to eight Lipizzaner Stallions with their riders performing an intricate, equine ballet, exhibiting maneuvers through the highest level of dressage. The Lipizzans prance, march and intricately weave their way across the floor to the music of the Masters in a spectacular ballet of four-footed white dancers.<br /><br /><strong>Harkening back to time when the horse</strong> was a symbol of grace and majesty, the Lipizzaner Stallions are truly a great experience to be enjoyed by the entire family. One does not need to be a horse lover to enjoy &quot;The Equestrian Treat of the Century&quot;! </p>

In this way, the reader can see how many publisers are covering a certain story and select their news reading according to what's hot at the moment. </p><p>He want on to explain that Google News offers a personalization tool that allows readers to dig deeper, to find niche material in which they might be interested that otherwise would be hard to find.&nbsp;</p><p>But Stoll emphasized that the news aggregator is &quot;not trying to be all things to all people&quot; and &quot;not trying to have an editorial voice.&quot; In fact, said Stolle, Google News encourages readers to read numerous publications so that they get a wide variety of views on a certain topic. The way the site is designed facilitates this process.</p><p>Google feels that the Internet opens up huge opportunities for publishers and that its aggregator portends to compliment news organizations online. Google News even has deals with several publishers to drive people to subscription sites with the hope of increasing their online revenues. It tries to generate new traffic for publishers by driving readers to websites. If publishers continue to produce quality content, those readers will keep coming back. </p><p>Stoll concluded by saying &quot;We want to establish symbiotic relationships (with publishers) where we can add value. We want to make readers become more passionate about news.&quot;</p>

                              <span class="news_annotation">As newspapers struggle with declining circulations, Saturday and Sunday editions along with supplements have proven to boost sales. <strong>George Brock</strong>, Saturday Editor of the UK's <em>Times</em>, <strong>Jan Jensen</strong>, Editor-in-Chief of <em>Ekstra Bladet</em> in Denmark and <strong>Berna Gonz&agrave;lez-Harbour</strong>, Sub-director, of the Spanish daily <em>El Pais</em> told the crowd at the 13th World Editors Forum of their papers' experiences with these feature-driven publications.</span><br /><br /><p>Brock took the floor first, reporting that the Saturday Times has a readership of 2 million and the most readers under 45 of its London quality competitors. It's Sunday sister boasts 3.5 million readers and accounts for half of all quality papers sold on Sunday in Britain.</p><p>The importance weekend editions play, according to Brock, can be seen in the substantial increase in pages. Throughout the 80's, the Saturday Times had only 1 section of 28 pages. Today it's a 378-page, 7 section collossus accompanied by a 470-page, 12 section Sunday edition.</p><p>Over the years, what used to be strictly news in the Saturday edition evolved into news, business, sports, travel, gardening, books, personal finance, property, listings, health, style, and food and drink. The wide variety of topics in weekend editions suits the weekend market when readers have more time to spend with the paper and when free papers and the Internet are not competing as much.</p><p>Brock summed up the success of weekend edtions by citing three keys:</p><ul><li>Well-tuned variety </li><li>Responsiveness to social change </li><li>Balancing online and offline</li></ul><p>Jan Jensen from the Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet wasn't shy to say that his paper was won of the most credible in Denmark. Founded itself as an extra paper in 1904 to cover the war between Russia and Japan, today Ekstra Bladet produces a host of supplements.<br /></p><p>The onlslaught of free papers has caused Ekstra Bladet to rethink its content strategy focusing on news, humor, sensation, exposures and provocation. It also launched a sports paper which by its own count is the most comprehensive sports coverage in Denmark.&nbsp;</p><p>Jensen admitted that there is no competition from free papers on weekends, but nevertheless, despite heavy rivalries with other major Danish papers, Ekstra Bladet has succeeded in increasing its weekend circulation. One contributing factor to this success is Flash, a 24-page supplement aimed at young and female readers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the fall, Ekstra Bladet will join with other Danish papers to print a free paper that will be distributed to 1.5 million people from Monday to Friday. There are three ways to fight the onslaught of free papers, said Jensen; journalism, journalism, journalism.<br /><br />Jensen said that the paper's website is produced apart from the printed paper and attracts an entirely different audience, but that both the print and online editions make a profit of between 10 and 15%.<br /><br />But Jansen reminded the audience that &quot;We don't publish newspapers to make money. We make money to publish newspapers.&quot;</p><p>As for the Southern European weekend market, Berna Gonzalez-Harbour first pointed out to the Moscow audience that El Pais has a 29% hold on the entire Spanish newspaper market, a statistic that jumps to 38% on Sundays. The Spanish daily's Sunday edition has enjoyed a 75,000 circulation spike over the past 5 years. </p><p>The Sunday edition has also helped attract female readers, 48% of which make up the Sunday readership, as well as younger readers, 250,000 more of which read the paper on the weekends.</p><p>El Pais has witnessed the most success with weekend editions and supplements because it diversifies itself in content and in format:</p><ul><li>entertainment <br /></li><li>science </li><li>the human face of politics </li><li>trends </li><li>flexibility </li><li>freedom of color </li><li>freedom of layout</li></ul>

                              <span class="news_annotation">The hottest debate at this year's World Editor Forum was about - you guessed it - the lessons learned from the Danish cartoon crisis...</span><br /><br /><p>Tuesday&rsquo;s World Editors Forum meeting ended with an intense debate about the infamous Danish cartoon controversy, and the lessons that might be learned from it. The participants were from the various focal points of the controversy, including Joern Mikkelsen, the chief editor of the newspaper that started it all -- Jyllands-Posten &ndash; and the newspaper&rsquo;s culture editor Fleming Rose (the man who commissioned the cartoons). Also participating were Eric LeBoucher of Le Monde, Imtiaz Alam from the South Asian Free Media Association in Pakistan, Hakeem Bello, the executive editor of Nigeria&rsquo;s The National Interest newspaper, Andrei Richter of the Moscow Media Law and Policy Institute, and Khaled Al-Belshy, the deputy editor of Egyptian newspaper Al-Destour. The session was moderated by UNESCO&rsquo;s Abdul-Waheed Khan and also featured much audience participation. <br /></p><p class="MsoNormal">The moderator, Abdel-Waheed Khan, began the session by emphasizing that both;<br /></p><ul><li>respect for freedom of speech, and </li><li>respect for religion</li></ul>are key pillars, and shouldn&rsquo;t be placed against each other. <p class="MsoNormal">That attempt to rationalize the issue began to lose focus as each speaker presented his point of view.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The first speaker was Mikkelsen, the Jyllands-Posten chief editor, who began his talk by listing several things that he wanted to clarify in the aftermath of the cartoon affair. </p><p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;No &ndash; JP is not an ultra right wing newspaper&rdquo;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&ldquo;No- JP is not the partner of an anti-Muslim worldwide movement&rdquo;</p><p class="MsoNormal">No- JP was not seeking to trigger a clash of civilizations.&rdquo;</p><p class="MsoNormal">And although Mikkelsen said, &ldquo;the religious feelings of all people should be respected,&rdquo; he also insisted that &ldquo;religions too can be brought up for discussion &ndash; it&rsquo;s the only way that society can move on.&rdquo;</p><p class="MsoNormal">On whether or not JP would do it again, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say.&rdquo; His main reason for saying that, however, did not seem to be because of the global turmoil that printing the cartoons caused, but mainly because the cartoonists themselves were now at risk.</p>Khaled Al-Balshy, the deputy editor of Egypt&rsquo;s Al-Destour weekly, began his speech by asking a key question: &ldquo;How can we have a broader minded world?&rdquo; He said the cartoon crisis had highlighted existing threats that could cause another clash. He also questioned the Egyptian government&rsquo;s role in the crisis, beginning with its ambassador to Denmark&rsquo;s insistence on upping the ante at every possible opportunity. Al-Balshy said this and other government efforts to enflame, rather than contain, the crisis, were taken because the government wanted to appear more &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; than its primary opponent &ndash; the Muslim brotherhood -- in upcoming parliamentary elections at the time. And since the government controls a great deal of Egypt&rsquo;s media, they managed to do so. He then broke down the three ways the press dealt with the situation: <ul><li>some government affiliated papers poured oil on the blaze </li><li>other independent papers that wanted to curry favor with the government did the same. </li><li>Some newspapers that wanted to increase their circulation also tried to do so by fanning popular sentiment. </li><li>He called papers that were neutral &ldquo;negative&rdquo; since they didn&rsquo;t do anything to stop the flames&hellip; </li><li>He singled out certain columnists for being moderate </li><li>He said his own paper Al-Destour actually alerted the public that the government was overdoing it.</li></ul><p class="MsoNormal">The basic problem for Al-Balshy was that people were protesting the cartoons while other important events (a ship sinking killing over a thousand people, activists being beaten up, elections being rigged) were not getting attention &ndash; mainly because the government wanted it that way&hellip;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Looking at things from a more global perspective, he said the Danish newspaper should have known that the prophet was a sacred figure; that they could criticize Islam, but not in this way. The western media that reprinted the cartoons also acted irresponsibly, he said. He concluded by saying that the cartoon incident showed that the western world looks at the Muslim world as a single entity, and vice versa.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Eric le Boucher of Le Monde defended his paper&rsquo;s decision to publish their own Mohamed cartoons. The reason why they didn&rsquo;t reprint the actual Danish cartoons he said, is because the paper was very aware that it was read in the Arab world, and was also not interested in putting its own correspondents in the Arab world in danger&hellip;Even though he condemned the Danish cartoonists&rsquo; attempts to link the prophet and terrorism, he could not accept the idea that picturing the prophet is blasphemy. &nbsp; </p><p class="MsoNormal">Imtiaz Alam, the general secretary of the South Asian Free Media Association in Pakistan, called the Danish experiment &ldquo;bad news&rdquo;&hellip; Why should the editors push the limits like this, he asks. </p><p class="MsoNormal">In his case, this situation put him in a tough position vis a vis the free press since he&rsquo;s been championing it for years&hellip; since free press now had a bad reputation in his part of the world &ndash; as a result of the cartoons.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This issue was not one of free expression, he says, but one of purposefully hurting the feelings of other people. &ldquo;Just because Muslims don&rsquo;t like these cartoons doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t have a sense of humor,&rdquo; he concluded.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Hakeem Bello, the executive editor of Nigeria&rsquo;s The National Interest newspaper, said ignorance of faith is unacceptable, especially when it comes to editors whose job is supposed to be based on knowledge.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Andre Richter of the Moscow Media Law and Policy Institute tried to summarize what happened in Russia, concluding that the cartoon crisis showed that it was impossible to control all 50,000 publications in the country, but did show that it is possible to seriously influence what can and cant be published&hellip;</p>JP culture editor Fleming Rose seemed as equally unrepentant about the brouhaha caused by the cartoons as his boss. For him, the core problem was that everybody was talking about Muslim prohibitions, even though every religion has taboos. It would be disastrous if we had to follow all of these, he said&hellip;&nbsp; <p class="MsoNormal">Overall the discussion, and the audience fray afterward, descended into the same kind of cross accusations and pandering to populism that the cartoon incident itself featured&hellip;</p><br />

                              Nomar Garciaparra and A.J. Pierzynski were American League All-Star teammates in 2002, the year that the Final Vote was introduced by MLB.com. They did not have to rely on it to be selected as reserves for that Midsummer Classic, but it was precisely that voice of the people that has made them All-Stars again. <p>Balloting ended at 6 p.m. ET Thursday in the Monster 2006 All-Star Final Vote, and those are the two survivors after a 94-hour process that resulted in a record 18.6 million votes overall, a lot of inspired campaigning and the closest overall competition in the five years of this last-chance selection process. </p><p>Garciaparra, the Dodgers' first baseman, fills the 32nd and final roster spot for the National League team by garnering more than four million votes. Pierzynski, the White Sox catcher, rounds out the AL squad with 3.6 million votes. Their leagues will meet in the 77th All-Star Game on July 11 at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, and both of those key members of likely postseason contenders will hope to help their respective leagues try to win World Series home-field advantage. </p><p>Fans again faced the difficult task of somehow choosing from among five very deserving candidates in each league, as provided by NL manager Phil Garner of the Astros and AL manager Ozzie Guillen of the White Sox. In order, Garciaparra finished ahead of Chris Capuano of the Brewers, 2004 Final Vote winner Bobby Abreu of the Phillies, Billy Wagner of the Mets and Chris Young of the Padres. Pierzynski finished first in a close race against Twins pitcher Francisco Liriano, and following in order were Travis Hafner of the Indians, Justin Verlander of the Tigers and Ramon Hernandez of the Orioles. </p><p>It marks the first time in Final Vote history that a team from a West Division has a winning representative. It is the second year in a row that a White Sox player has won the vote, following Scott Podsednik in 2005. Out of 10 all-time Final Vote winners, eight different clubs now have been represented. </p><p>Here is a closer look at the two stars: </p><p><strong>Nomar Garciaparra:</strong> After representing the Red Sox as an AL shortstop in his previous five All-Star trips, he makes the NL roster now as a first-year first baseman on a new club. Garciaparra becomes the fourth first basemen on the NL roster, joining starter Albert Pujols of the Cardinals (the Majors' top overall vote-getter) and reserves Ryan Howard of the Phillies and Lance Berkman of the Astros. </p><p>If there was any doubt about whether a league batting leader (.359 average through Wednesday) should be omitted from an All-Star Game, then it was settled in this one. Garciaparra led the NL after each of the first two announced updates, and then finished ahead of Capuano at the closing bell. Garciaparra certainly was among the least outspoken in support of himself during those 94 hours of voting. </p><p>&quot;I'm extremely grateful to the Dodger organization for its support and everything it has done over the last couple of days,&quot; said Garciaparra. &quot;Most importantly, I want to thank all the Dodger fans that voted for me and helped me reach the All-Star Game with my hometown team. Getting to wear the Dodger uniform on a national stage is an honor that I will truly cherish.&quot; </p><p>Typical of the grassroots campaigning that has come to characterize the Final Vote process, the Dodgers organization did a lot of speaking for him. Gigantic posters throughout Dodger Stadium urged fans to vote, the club reached out to all the local radio stations to spread the word, and during each one of Garciaparra's at-bats, the &quot;Vote Nomar&quot; button was on DodgerVision. There also was an ad in Thursday's <em>Los Angeles Times</em> mentioning the vote. </p><p>Blogging emerged as one more key weapon in the campaign arsenal for clubs. While the <strong><a href="http://whitesoxpride.mlblogs.com/">Inside the White Sox</a></strong> MLBlog continued to be an effective unfiltered communications tool for that front office and its fan base, the Dodgers had two of them going on behalf of Garciaparra. Dodgers legend Tommy Lasorda pushed Nomar on <strong><a href="http://tommy.mlblogs.com/">Tommy Lasorda's World</a></strong>, and there was plenty of Final Vote reachout and vote reporting happening on the <strong><a href="http://insidethedodgers.mlblogs.com/">Inside the Dodgers</a></strong> blog. It's another way the Final Vote is evolving. </p><p>&quot;I can't help but think that the front office's new blog has played an important role in reaching out to our fans,&quot; Josh Rawitch, the Dodgers' director of public relations and primary author of &quot;Inside the Dodgers,&quot; said during the last 24 hours of voting. &quot;They have really stepped up over the last few days and we're hopeful that our grassroots campaign will help push him over the top and send him to Pittsburgh where he deserves to be.&quot; </p><p>Garciaparra was announced as the NL Final Vote winner one day before the Dodgers will go after the Guinness World Record for the largest number of people playing bingo at the same time in one place. </p><p><strong>A.J. Pierzynski:</strong> Guillen's regular catcher becomes the third backstop on the AL roster. Pudge Rodriguez of the Tigers overtook Jason Varitek of the Red Sox during the final week of starter balloting, and Joe Mauer of the Twins, leading the Majors in batting, was added as a reserve. </p><p>Pierzynski entered Thursday night's game against Baltimore (and Final Vote competitor Hernandez) with a .327 batting average, seventh-best in the AL. He was a key player in Chicago's march to a storied World Series championship last fall, and he has deftly handled a pitching staff generally regarded as among the best in the Majors. </p><p>He also had a &quot;Punch A.J.&quot; campaign that may have been simply irresistible. </p><p>&quot;I thought it was awesome, and I know a lot of people want to do that,&quot; Guillen said with a wry smile after the Final Vote process began. &quot;In the meanwhile, I think it's a great thing to have. I think it's great entertainment. ... He deserves to be there.&quot; </p><p>Enough people thought Pierzynski should be an All-Star again, and he had fun with the process itself. Shortly after originally finding out he was on the Final Vote ballot, Pierzynski text-messaged his friends and family in doing his part to get out the vote. Pierzynski joked Wednesday that when he sent messages to those same people again, they responded that they already had voted. </p><p>&quot;I told them I need more,&quot; he mused. &quot;Tell some more people. Get out on the streets.&quot; </p><p>White Sox employees wore &quot;Punch A.J.&quot; shirts around U.S. Cellular Field during the homestand, and those same shirts were sold to the public Wednesday night at the ballpark. &quot;I should have patented it,&quot; Pierzynski joked, when asked if he gets a cut from the slogan's profits. </p><p>For the second year in a row, the White Sox organization again was able to extol its candidate's virtues to a captive audience within a home ballpark. Garciaparra was being trumpeted to his voting public while playing at Dodger Stadium throughout the process as well. Does that help a Final Vote candidate? One can argue that the Twins were on the road but they helped engineer a creative grassroots campaign (ie local highway signs) while their players were away this week. But the fact is, only one out of the 10 Final Vote winners has survived when his team was playing on the road during the voting process: Varitek with the Red Sox in 2003. </p><p>The Inside the White Sox blog by VP/Communications Scott Reifert was a clear indicator about how Sox fans were voting. Read the <a href="http://whitesoxpride.mlblogs.com/inside_the_white_sox/2006/07/this_is_it.html#comments">comments</a> and you can see in the final hour of balloting: &quot;I just voted over 400 times for A.J. so he had better win this thing.&quot; </p><p>Pierzynski helped his own cause on and off the field during the Final Vote days. He already had been scheduled to sign autographs with teammate Joe Crede from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Thursday at the Fun Time Stage during White Sox Day at Taste of Chicago. But the timing couldn't have worked out much better for the White Sox catcher. </p><p>&quot;Maybe I should walk around with, like, a cop or something. Maybe play some music or something,&quot; said Pierzynski with a smile. &quot;Whatever it takes.&quot; Then he added: &quot;I'm just honored to be on the list.&quot; </p><p>Now he and Garciaparra are on the All-Star list again. And this time they have you to thank for it. </p><p><strong>Final Vote history</strong><br />Here is the updated list of winners since the Final Vote was introduced on MLB.com: </p><p><strong>2006:</strong> A.J. Pierzynski (White Sox) in AL, Nomar Garciaparra (Dodgers) in NL.<br /><strong>2005:</strong> Scott Podsednik (White Sox) in AL, Roy Oswalt (Astros) in NL.<br /><strong>2004:</strong> Hideki Matsui (Yankees) in AL, Bobby Abreu (Phillies) in NL.<br /><strong>2003:</strong> Jason Varitek (Red Sox) in AL, Geoff Jenkins (Brewers) in NL.<br /><strong>2002:</strong> Johnny Damon (Red Sox) in AL, Andruw Jones (Braves) in NL. </p><p>&bull; It marked the fifth consecutive year that the White Sox have had at least one representative. No other club has had a choice for fans every year. </p><p>&bull; New clubs with choices this year include Baltimore (Hernandez) and Detroit (Verlander) in the AL, and the Dodgers (Garciaparra) and Mets (Wagner) in the NL. The only clubs that never have been represented in the Final Vote include the Blue Jays, Mariners, Rangers, Reds and Royals. The Nationals never have been represented as a Washington team, but Orlando Cabrera was a candidate in 2003 when they were known as the Montreal Expos. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="floatRight textSm" style="width: 302px"><a href="http://montebubbles.net/NASApp/mlb/mlb/events/all_star/y2006/index.jsp"><img title="All-Star Game Coverage" height="60" alt="All-Star Game Coverage" src="http://montebubbles.net/mlb/images/events/all_star/y2006/im_coverage_302x60.gif" width="302" border="0" /></a><br /><div style="padding-right: 2px; margin-top: 2px; padding-left: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px; border-left: #ffc321 1px solid; padding-top: 2px; border-bottom: #ffc321 1px solid" align="right"><a href="http://montebubbles.net/NASApp/mlb/mlb/events/all_star/y2006/index.jsp">Complete All-Star Game coverage &gt;</a></div></div><p>The Final Vote was created for the purpose of letting fans take action via technology rather than what had become a time-honored ritual of many people squawking about who was snubbed in the All-Star selection process. </p><p>&quot;Since the All-Star Game is about who the fans want to see the most, it made sense to come up with a way for fans to be the ones to select the final player,&quot; said Gregg Klayman, director of fantasy and interactive games for MLB Advanced Media and originator of the Final Vote concept. &quot;Years ago, there was no good way to do this, since last-second paper balloting would have been next to impossible to pull off. Luckily, the Internet showed up one day to make things like this possible for fans to participate in. The response we've gotten in the program's first four years shows that fans have a tremendous interest in being the ones to have the final say.&quot; </p><p><strong>Final Vote, but not final voting</strong><br />It has been a long and empowering end of online balloting for fans at MLB.com and the 30 club sites, and it didn't end the close of the Monster 2006 All-Star Final Vote, either. For the fourth consecutive year, fans around the world will have the opportunity to participate in the Midsummer Classic when they cast their votes for the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award, presented by Chevrolet, at the Midsummer Classic via the Monster 2006 All-Star Game MVP Vote on MLB.com. </p><p>Beginning in the sixth inning of the Midsummer Classic, fans can cast their votes for the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award. The voting will continue until the MVP is announced immediately following the end of the game. </p><p>The online fan vote will count for 20 percent, with the other 80 percent coming onsite from the Baseball Writers Association of America and the announcers from the All-Star Game's three broadcast rights holders: FOX Sports, ESPN Radio and MLB International. </p><p>Immediately following the conclusion of the All-Star Game, the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player will receive the Arch Ward Trophy, which was first presented in 1962 as a tribute to the man who founded the All-Star Game in 1933. </p><p>The 77th All-Star Game will be televised nationally by FOX Sports, in Canada by Rogers Sportsnet and Sportsnet HD and televised around the world by Major League Baseball International, with pregame ceremonies beginning at 8 p.m. ET. ESPN Radio will provide exclusive, national radio coverage, while MLB.com will provide extensive online coverage and MLB Radio will provide exclusive play-by-play coverage of the game on the Internet. XM Satellite Radio will provide satellite radio play-by-play coverage of the XM Satellite Radio All-Star Futures Game.</p>

                           <div class="entry-body">
                              China International Consumer Electronics Show (SINOCES) press conference is held in Qingdao in June 12<sup>th</sup>. Reporters learned that the jobs of 2006 SINOCES are being all smoothly implemented and different kinds of preparation jobs have been ready. The exhibition area is estimated to be more than 35,000 square meters. There are more than 400 exhibitors, involving one-fourth overseas enterprises. Many World Top 500 Multinational Firms take part in this show actively, such as INTEL and SONY. Consumer electronics power&mdash;America and Japan&mdash;in order to organize teams to attend 2006 SINOCES, their officials cooperate strongly with exhibitors, buyers, professional attendees domestic media and standard organizations. All that exhibition area, number of booths, exhibitors, level of show or level of forum, 2006 SINOCES will be No.1 of all these years. And this show will also strengthen its status of&nbsp; No.1 Asian－Pacific Consumer Electronics Show. <div align="center">Theme of 2006 SINOCES&mdash;Ubiquitous</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said that 2006 SINOCES will be held in Qingdao International Convention Center during July 7<sup>th</sup> -10<sup>th</sup>, with the theme being &ldquo;Ubiquitous&rdquo;. Looking from the global consumer electronics, most of the countries and areas are still in E time, that is to say, in the developmental stage guided by technology. But with the development of technology or the strength of compatibility between software and hardware, this stage will face new problems of product-popularizing and user-guiding. How to penetrate quickly the products which are the result of fusion of 3G and how to make users satisfied with their individual needs are the deep reasons of U-strategy planning. No matter ubiquitous supported by unite, universal, user, unique or theories, objects, routes of this developmental stage, all of these are big challenges to present whole strategy framework of information electronics society.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3C is only a means to U, while the final reach of U must be supported by more auxiliary equipments. U-strategy is a power and direction to guide industry transformation and innovation of present industry development. World is changing all the time, but the reach of U-strategy will make this change more free, smooth and quick.</div><div align="center">CES Come in, It Will Be Better in 2006</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is said that CES decided to set up strategic partnership with SINOCES from 2005. They held exhibition cooperatively and CES enterprises data base is free to SINOCES. American CES have been held at Las Vegas for mare than 80 years. Every year there are more than 2,400 enterprises attending CES. It is the first Consumer Electronics Show in the world. Its intervention must be changing the exhibition rules of the whole consumer electronics industry in the eastern hemisphere. During the cooperation with CES, SINOCE can be supported by global internet propaganda resources of CES, and depends on Chinese market which is the fastest development country of consumer electronics. While the most important matter is it makes the focus of global consumer electronics shows to move from west to east. This change is even more evident in 2006.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year CES brings not only American exhibitors, but also many professional buyers and authoritative judge test organization of consumer electronics products. And its large scale exhibition has increased awareness of American authoritative media, such as New Times and Washington Daily which asked for permission to report this show. Moreover, Japanese Nikkei BP, Wave News Agency and Russian News Agency and the like, they also prepare to take part in. Such grand media is scarce to be seen in consumer electronics shows in the whole Asian-Pacific area. We can say that CES comes in and the effect is better than the first year. This also proves that it is successful to hold exhibition cooperatively.</div><div align="center">Scale of Exhibitor and Level of Forums is the Best One of All the Past</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Show of international level attracts enterprises of international level. Many famous international enterprises have confirmed to take part in this show, such as INTEL, Sony, Epson, Toshiba and NEC. America, Japan, Korea, France and Australia, these world home appliance giants all bring their missions. The enterprises attending this show basically cover all top consumer electronics in the world, including not only traditional home appliance manufacturers, but also new enterprises of IT, communication and digital house area, such as TD&mdash;SCDMA. Nearly 50 of World Top 500 Multinational Firms will take part in this show. The number of international brands ranks top of domestic shows.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among domestic enterprises, Haier, Hisense, Lenovo, Aucma, Konka, Changhong, Prima, they take part in this show actively. Which is needed to be paid attention to is China Mobile, China Netcom and Bao Steel Group Co. attend exhibition too. This proves that China International Consumer Electronics Show not only attracts world consumer electronics enterprises, but also increases awareness of electronics supporting companies and communication service providers.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coming of &ldquo;Giant&rdquo; manufacturers attracts global buyers. American Bestbuy, French Carrefour, German Metro and domestic Guomei, Suning, Sanlian, Yonglie&mdash;more than 500 international buyers will gather in Qingdao, covering all large home appliance chains in the world. This breaks recording of domestic home appliance exhibitions. And it is certainty that 2006 SINOCES is a valuable grand event for all the exhibitors.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number and level of subject forums of 2006 SINOCES break the record too. This year, the number of decided subject forums is up to 16. And the discussion direction added digital home, 3G communication and industry revolution of U age except for consumer electronics channels, industry development, product innovation and 3G fusion. Great number of forums, high level and superior consciousness of discussion have drew attention of professional people of foreign and domestic consumer electronics industry.</div><div align="center">Only Consumer Electronics Show Certificated by American Ministry of Commerce in Asian-Pacific Area</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is learned by reporters from press conference that SINOCES has acquired certification issued by American Ministry of Commerce recently, becoming the only consumer electronics show certificated by American Ministry of Commerce in Asian-Pacific Area by now.</div><div>Reporter has inquired this matter from Commerce Department of American Embassy in China. Clerks told the reporter that at present American Ministry of Commerce has recommended exhibitions in Germany, India and Singapore except for its domestic CES, but most of the shows are monomial shows, such as Communication Show. The only recommended comprehensive consumer electronics show in Asian-Pacific Area is SINOCES in Qingdao. Because of its fine records, good stability and huge potential, SINOCES impressed American Ministry of Commerce and CEA profoundly, and let them find the business opportunities supported by huge consumer electronics hinterland in China. </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the successful holding and strengthening of influence of SINOCES at home and abroad, SINOCES has become a remarkable brand in consumer electronics field in Qingdao and even in China. Theme design and direction of 2006 SINOCES&mdash;&ldquo;Ubiquitous&rdquo;&mdash;will become strong impetus of a new round reformation and change of global consumer electronics industry by all means. The proposition of U age strategy not only puts forward new theoretical framework for revolution in global consumer electronics area, but also consolidate its authority and prospect in own field, resulting in strategic upgrading of the whole consumer electronics area and unprecedented exchange and open situation in the world. </div>

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><strong><h5>Special Launch Offer Includes Free Pan-European Traffic and Coverage </h5></strong><p><!--BSHSTARTBODY-->Telmap (<a href="http://www.telmap.com/" target="_blank">www.telmap.com</a>), a leading provider of mobile Mapping and Navigation solutions, today announced the launch of a pre-installed Telmap Navigator mobile navigation system for new Nokia Eseries phones in the UK. This launch is part of Telmap's support for Nokia S60 3rd Edition devices. The Eseries initiative includes a free trial offer for full-featured Europe-wide mobile navigation and mapping, including in-car and pedestrian navigation, mapping, points of interest, and rich content. The free trial is unique in the market in that it also includes real-time traffic updates. </p><p>Initially, Telmap Navigator will come pre-installed on Nokia E60, Nokia E61 and Nokia E70 smartphones sold in the UK. As part of the program, Telmap and Nokia have also launched an in-box co-marketing campaign that provides purchasers of the phones with information about the Telmap Navigator application and a special offer for either UK-only or Europe-wide service that can be activated after the trial period ends. </p><p>In time with the introduction, Telmap has launched the first phase of a new online store (<a href="http://www.shop.telmap.com/" target="_blank">www.shop.telmap.com</a>) that will enable mobile phones users to subscribe to the Telmap Navigator service. Nokia Eseries users in the UK will have a choice of service packages and options, enabling them to select the geographic coverage and service period that best suit their lifestyles. </p><p>Nokia Eseries phones are targeted to the enterprise market, and Telmap Navigator is one of five pre-loaded applications selected by Nokia for their business user customers. </p><p>&quot;We are very happy that Nokia selected Telmap Navigator as the pre-installed mobile navigation solution for its high-end phones,&quot; said Oren Nissim, CEO of Telmap. &quot;We are looking forward to continuing our collaboration.&quot; </p><p>Real-time navigation and location-based information </p><p>Telmap Navigator turns each phone into a handheld real-time mobile navigation and information guide, ideal for both in-car and pedestrian navigation. It guides subscribers along the best route to their desired destination using voice instructions and high-quality onscreen maps, with turn by turn instructions for both in-car and pedestrian navigation. It provides real-time content, such as traffic, as well as information and direct dialing to millions of points of interest (POIs) such as restaurants, hotels, gas stations, theaters and more. Telmap Navigator also enables users to share POI addresses and other information with friends and colleagues via SMS. </p><p>The Telmap Navigator solution is based on Telmap's new generation patented MOND (Mobile Optimized Navigation Data) technology, which optimizes the transfer of navigation and map data from a central server to users' wireless devices. MOND technology utilizes advanced compression to deliver more complete, useful, timely and reliable navigation data to mobile handsets. </p><p>About Telmap </p><p>Telmap is a leading technology provider of a wide range of innovative applications designed for the mobile mapping and navigation arena. Its server-based solution provides premium content, global geographic coverage, and travel content -- all in real-time. </p><p>Telmap prides itself on being the creator of some of the most progressive Mapping and Navigation solutions.

                              <br /><br /><img title="NASA" height="179" alt="NASA" src="http://montebubbles.net/june26/nasa.bmp" width="204" align="left" border="0" />NASA will test concepts for future space exploration next month by sending three astronauts and an oceanographer on a mission to an underwater laboratory off the coast of Florida. <br /><br />Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Koichi Wakata will lead the crew on a seven-day undersea mission July 22 to 28 aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aquarius underwater laboratory. NASA astronauts Andrew J. Feustel and Karen L. Nyberg, and Karen Kohanowich, deputy director of NOAA's Undersea Research Program, Silver Spring, Md., round out the crew. Mark Hulsbeck and Dominic Landucci of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington will provide engineering support. <br /><br />The NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) 10 project <br />will include undersea extravehicular activities imitating moonwalks <br />to test concepts for mobility, using weighted backpacks to simulate <br />lunar and Martian gravity. Techniques for communication, navigation <br />and using remote-controlled robots on the moon's surface also will be <br />tested. <br /><br />&quot;Whether walking and working on the ocean floor or exploring the lunar <br />surface, significant prior planning, training and dependence on <br />sophisticated life support systems is necessary,&quot; said NEEMO Project <br />Manager Bill Todd, Johnson Space Flight Center (JSC), Houston. &quot;Sure, <br />you won't see any pretty fish on a moonwalk, but you will see the <br />same types of crew, hardware and procedure challenges that are <br />associated with this type of an ocean habitation and research <br />mission.&quot; <br /><br />This mission also exemplifies the partnership between NASA and NOAA <br />for NEEMO. <br /><br />&quot;NOAA will use this opportunity to build on its undersea research <br />efforts and interagency partnership successes,&quot; said Kohanowich. <br /><br />&quot;Humans working both in space and under the ocean face similar <br />challenges of lack of oxygen, weightlessness, remoteness, extreme <br />pressure differentials and cramped quarters. Many techniques, <br />technologies, and skills necessary to work underwater can be adapted <br />for lunar research, and vice versa,&quot; Kohanowich stated. <br /><br />Aquarius is owned and funded by NOAA and operated by the University of <br />North Carolina at Wilmington. This is the second of three NEEMO <br />missions planned for this year. The work will be monitored at JSC's <br />Exploration Planning Operations Center (ExPOC), Houston. The <br />45-foot-long, 13-foot-diameter complex is three miles off Key Largo <br />in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. It rests about 62 feet <br />beneath the surface. A shore-based mission control center in Florida <br />monitors the habitat and crew. <br /><br />Born in Saitama, Japan, Wakata reported to JSC in August 1992. He flew <br />as the first Japanese mission specialist on the space shuttle mission <br />STS-72 in January 1996. He flew to the space station on STS-92 in <br />October 2000. Wakata has a Bachelor of Science, a Master of Science, <br />and doctorate in aerospace engineering from Kyushu University, Japan. <br /><br /><br />Selected as a mission specialist by NASA in July 2000, Feustel <br />completed two years of initial training and evaluation before <br />assignment to the Astronaut Office Space Shuttle and Space Station <br />branches. He has an Associate Science degree from Oakland Community <br />College in Michigan, a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science <br />from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Ind., and a Ph.D. in <br />geological sciences from Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, <br />Canada. Feustel considers Lake Orion, Mich., his hometown. <br /><br />Selected as a mission specialist by NASA in July 2000, Nyberg <br />considers Vining, Minn., her hometown. She served as crew support <br />astronaut for Expedition 6 at the International Space Station and <br />currently supports the Space Shuttle Branch and the Exploration <br />Branch. She has a Bachelor of Science from the University of North <br />Dakota, and a Master of Science and Ph.D. in mechanical engineering <br />from the University of Texas at Austin. <br /><br />Kohanowich became the deputy director of NOAA's Undersea Research <br />Program in April 2005. Previously she was a U.S. Navy deep sea diver <br />and oceanographer and retired as a commander after 23 years of <br />service. Early in her career, Kohanowich supported 1,000 FSW (feet of <br />sea water) saturation dives at the Navy Experimental Diving Unit. <br /><br /><br />For information about NEEMO, visit: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/neemo" target="_blank">http://www.nasa.gov/neemo</a><br />

                              <p><strong>Rev Your 'Carts' for Adrenaline-Pumping Competition Coming to St. Louis</strong> </p><p><strong>- Applications Accepted Now Through August 28, 2006 - </strong></p><p>&nbsp;Who says only racecars with engines have speed? For car fanatics and gear heads to under-the-hood rookies and full-service pump customers -- the Red Bull Soap Box Race may be the ticket to speedway stardom. This unique non-motorized racing event takes to the streets in St. Louis' Forest Park on October 28, challenging both experienced racers and auto amateurs alike to design and build outrageous, human-powered Soap Box dream machines and compete against the clock in a downhill race. The team with the most speed, creativity and showmanship will, in addition to earning themselves a place in Red Bull racing history, win the grand prize -- the chance of a lifetime to go behind-the-scenes with VIP access to Red Bull's inaugural NASCAR Nextel Cup racing team competition in 2007.<br /></p><p>The call is out for 50, five-member teams to employ artistic creativity and technical prowess to design, build and drive their own home-made non-motorized soap box carts and power them. The teams will hurtle head-to-head past spectators along a customized course in St. Louis's Forest Park as they gain velocity on a giant downhill ramp. Power players who enjoy the thrill of competition and engineering geniuses can apply online at www.redbullsoapboxusa.com through August 28, 2006. Crafts will be judged on speed, the ingenuity of each team's construction and showmanship -- if it's drivable, you're ready to race!<br /></p><p>MOVE OVER BOY SCOUTS, THIS IS SERIOUS RACING!<br /></p><p>Not to be confused with the youth soapbox derby, Red Bull Soap Box is a national race for amateur drivers, which is fueled by creativity and competitive fun -- not to mention the need for speed. It is the first-ever race of its kind to hit the U.S. and St. Louis, which is a city rich in hometown pride, cultural heritage and also the gateway to the West. The event will take place in Forest Park, which is dubbed the &quot;Crown Jewel&quot; of metropolitan St. Louis and the location of the 1904 World Fair. Thousands of spectators are expected to flock to this signature racing event to cheer on their favorite, most outrageous Soap Box. Collegiate, high school and cross-town rivals are encouraged to flaunt their spirit and one-up each other.<br /></p><p>The race will follow a single-elimination, bracketed duel format whereby two drivers will race side-by-side on a downhill circuit against the clock to see who crosses the finish line first. This adds an extra element of excitement to the race as the teams must battle it out on the track and chance a crash. Here's the twist -- bragging rights don't go to the fastest vehicle. Although speed is key, outrageous design and showmanship also counts.<br /></p><p>MOTORS MUST TAKE A HIKE: RULES OF THE ROAD<br /></p><p>Despite its innovative feel, Red Bull Soap Box Race does have a few rules and regulations. First off, all driving machines must be entirely human-powered -- no stored power or external energy sources allowed. Secondly, all vehicles must be less than six feet wide, less than 20 feet in length and no more than seven feet from the ground. And finally, all crafts must weigh no more than 450 lbs (including the pilot.)<br /></p><p>Play by the rules and you could cash in BIG time. The first place prize is a VIP trip for all five team members to see Red Bull's inaugural NASCAR Nextel Cup racing team compete next year (cash value $7,500.) The second prize an the ultimate driving day/weekend (cash value $5,000) and third prize is an afternoon spent racing against each other at the Grand Prix Speedway in Maryland Heights, MO (cash value $1,500.) Don't wait for the flag to drop ... Get your creative &quot;motor&quot; running and test your craft at Red Bull Soap Box Race!<br /></p><p>A WHACKY RACING HISTORY ...<br /></p><p>The first edition of Red Bull Soap Box Race took place in Belgium in 2000, and has since visited several countries including Austria, England, Sweden, Czech Republic, Australia, Italy, Finland, Ireland, Germany and South Africa.<br /></p><p>To apply, visit www.redbullsoapboxusa.com. </p><p><span class="label">Source: </span>Red Bull </p><p>&nbsp;</p><!---------------------------------->

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New web-based educational suite leverages enduring popularity of Pokemon brand to engage and challenge students </strong></p><p>One of the biggest challenges educators face year after year is generating student enthusiasm, curiosity and interest in the learning process, which are powerful drivers of student achievement. With today's release of Pokemon Learning League by Pokemon USA, Inc., educators can harness the broad appeal and imaginative spirit of Pokemon(R), with its captivating animation and storylines, to motivate and engage a diverse range of students in core curriculum lessons.<br /></p><p>Pokemon Learning League is a web-based educational suite of animated, interactive lessons in language arts, math, science, and life skills for grades 3-6. Drawing upon current research and using proven instructional strategies, the program is aligned with state and national standards and is designed to help teachers reinforce concepts taught in the classroom.<br /></p><p>&quot;Motivation and engagement are decisive factors in student learning, no matter what a student's background or abilities,&quot; said Yves Saada, vice president of interactive media for Pokemon USA, Inc. &quot;Pokemon Learning League offers educators a flexible tool that excites and engages all learners in challenging, standards-based content, which can be especially helpful in encouraging the improvement of struggling learners and special needs students.&quot;<br /></p><p>Pokemon Learning League uses a variety of instructional techniques and activities to help educators adapt instruction to accommodate a range of student abilities and a multitude of learning styles. Through its appealing animation and interactive lessons, the program illustrates key concepts in a way that is accessible and easy to comprehend, helping students who may not have fully grasped the material through other teaching methods.<br /></p><p>Lessons are presented in a three-step format that provides guided and scaffolded instruction for students.<br /></p><pre class="list">  -- Watch: The learning adventure begins with a narrative-based animated      segment in which students, along with the Pokemon characters, are      introduced to the educational concept.   -- Try:  Next, students collaborate with the characters to explore and      interact with the material, receiving feedback and support to help      deepen their understanding.   -- Apply: After practicing with the material, students have an opportunity      to apply what they have learned to interactive challenges.  </pre><p>Throughout the program, Pokemon characters demonstrate creative problem- solving skills and prosocial behaviors such as teamwork and skill building to serve as models for students.<br /></p><p>The interactive, exploratory component of the lessons enables students to test their understanding and application of concepts in a safe, rewarding context. Because each lesson is designed to be approximately 10 minutes in length and is accessible online, students can move through the lessons at their own pace.<br /></p><p>As students proceed through the lessons, they receive positive reinforcement and feedback. Recent educational research indicates that ongoing feedback is critical in helping students gain self-awareness, in minimizing their frustration and in building intrinsic motivation for improvement. Pokemon Learning League enables students to monitor and celebrate their progress throughout the program, receiving points toward special badges as they complete each unit.<br /></p><p>A decade after it was first introduced, Pokemon remains a pervasive and well-known brand due in large part to its immersive storylines and high- interest animated characters. Building on this tradition, Pokemon Learning League is uniquely positioned to create the needed link between activities that students seek outside of school and the concepts that they need to learn in school.<br /></p><p>To meet educators' needs, the program components are developed by experienced education writers, editors and producers and are evaluated by an advisory board of prominent educators with expertise in curriculum, instruction, and technology integration. Teacher supporting resources such as printable quizzes are included in the program to help teachers integrate the program into classroom instruction.<br /></p><p>Educators and students can enjoy free online access to Pokemon Learning League until October 31, 2006. The program will be available to schools, households, and after-school programs on a subscription basis following the free trial period.

                              <strong><h5>Henry Cho Tells All in New Comedy Central Special, CD and DVD </h5></strong><p><!--BSHSTARTBODY-->Henry Cho, the quick-witted Korean comic with the slow-burning Southern accent, will soon be all over the map via a Comedy Central special on July 14 and the release of his first album and DVD on July 18. Each of these projects is titled: &quot;Henry Cho: What's That Clickin' Noise?&quot; </p><p>Filmed and recorded at the Tennessee Theatre in Knoxville -- Cho's hometown -- the special showcases the comedian's genius for transforming real-life incidents into sidesplitting stories. And, unlike most other comics, Cho specializes in family-friendly routines. &quot;I haven't cursed on stage in 20 years,&quot; he proclaims proudly. &quot;Not once. There's never been a need to. I could do my show in a church. The stories are funny, but the language is clean.&quot; </p><p>Until this special came around, Cho had resisted persistent requests to record an album, preferring to be seen in action rather than simply heard. But it soon became apparent to him that the special would translate perfectly into a CD and DVD. &quot;I'm not doing anything different,&quot; Cho stresses. &quot;So I decided, 'Why not?'&quot; </p><p>The CD and DVD will be released on Warner Bros./Jack Records, the home of fellow funnymen Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and Larry The Cable Guy. Indeed, these three jokesters show up at the beginning of Cho's DVD -- as cartoon characters. </p><p>&quot;I'm full-blooded Korean,&quot; Cho says when he introduces himself to his audiences. &quot;I was born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee. So I'm South Korean</p>

(TSX: <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=iwire&amp;PageName=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=TSX:ASA" target="_blank">ASA</a>), makers of ACDSee&trade; photo management software and Canvas&trade; technical illustration software, announced today the release of ACDSee Photo Editor - an innovative photo editing application that offers memory keepers and photo enthusiasts the tools and guidance needed to turn their digital photos into something truly special and unique. </p><p>ACDSee Photo Editor helps photo enthusiasts of all levels turn their creative inspiration into photo perfection. From performing quick fixes such as lighting and red-eye correction to creating fun projects like scrapbook pages, CD covers, invitations, and more, Photo Editor walks you through the creative process, step-by-step, using interactive How-To lessons easy enough for even beginners to quickly master, yet powerful enough to handle the most creative details. </p><p>For people just starting out with photo editing, Photo Editor offers unique tools designed to make usually complex tasks much easier to accomplish. It does so by providing users with a sense of confidence and direction right from the very first time they use the application, so they can learn while doing, guided by the program itself. </p><p>Some of the major features in the programs that make photo editing easy and enjoyable for users include: </p><p>- How-tos: Offer guided walk-throughs of projects that teach you how to be creative with your photos step-by-step, from start to finish. That way, users can easily create CD covers, albums, and other great creative projects from the very first time they open the application. </p><p>- Vignette Tool: Creates stunning portrait-style photos in one simple action - streamlining and facilitating a process for new users that would normally require more advanced techniques. </p><p>- Adjustment/Filter Variations: Simplifies the creative process by displaying up to eight different previews of your original photo, right on screen, each preview showing a different variation of the effect, adjustment, or filter you're applying. </p><p>- Text Support: Simplifies the process of adding clever, descriptive text to your creative projects and provides the option to wrap text into thought bubbles or curve your text with a simple click. </p><p>- Batch Process: Saves time by allowing users to perform certain processes like applying an adjustment/filter, copying objects such as logos, clipart, or images, or creating vignettes to more than one photo at a time with just a couple of clicks. </p><p><br /><br />- Cookie Cutter Tool: Crops your creation into fun shapes like letters, numbers, animals, or shapes, or add distinctive borders to your projects with a simple click. </p><p>Photo Editor also contains deeper features that meet the needs of more advanced users. Advanced users can create complex projects in Photo Editor's object-based environment using selection tools, gradients, masking techniques, blending modes, and in-depth vector object support. </p><p>&quot;Photo Editor is the next step in our strategy of offering exceptional products at a reasonable price for specific audiences,&quot; said James Latham, vice president of marketing for ACD Systems. &quot;The product is made for the population of creative individuals without the time or inclination to master such complex products as Photoshop, but who nevertheless have the desire to imbue their photos with creativity.&quot; </p><p>Pricing and Availability </p><p>The full version of ACDSee Photo Editor is available in English for $69.99 (USD), $49.99 for the upgrade from ACDSee Photo Editor 3.1, ACDSee PowerPack, or FotoCanvas.

More than 1,700 editors and media figures from 100 countries had gathered for the opening ceremony.

The Kremlin says the president was late, but only by five minutes, and that both sides agreed to change the order of speeches. </p><p>When Mr Putin did enter the hall, two protesters, members of the National Bolshevik Party, leapt from their seats, brandishing a flag bearing a hammer and sickle and shouting &quot;No to censorship!&quot; and &quot;Russia without Putin!&quot; They were quickly removed. </p><p><strong>Plea for free press </strong></p><p>Mr Putin then had some uncomfortable moments as the association's president, Gavin O'Reilly, raised what he said were deeply held concerns about press freedom in Russia. </p><p>&quot;Your country and your administration have been severely criticised internationally for an alleged unwillingness to forego control and influence over the media,&quot; Mr O'Reilly said. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="bo">He asked why the Russian state was accused of creating an atmosphere of self-censorship and fear in the press, why the government and industrial groups linked to it had been taking control of the media, especially TV channels and why local media were coming under similar control. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;There is still very widespread scepticism, both inside and outside your country, about whether there exists any real willingness to see the media become a financially strong, influential and independent participant in Russian society today,&quot; Mr O'Reilly said. </p><p>He concluded by appealing personally to Russia's president to &quot;take vital new measures... to help your great country develop the strong independent press that it merits&quot;. </p><p>Mr Putin sidestepped most of the issues, saying that the proportion of state ownership in the media was decreasing and that a free press was a key guarantor of Russia's democracy. </p><p>&quot;Without a free press, the great transformations of the 1990s would have been simply impossible, and today I would like once again to underline the not only special but irreplaceable role of the written word in the making of the new Russia,&quot; Mr Putin said. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

I think a method needs to be developed whereby the multi-media moving version of an advert only appears if you click on it.&quot;</div><div>Hill was presenting a new innovation by Microsoft, working in partnership with the New York Times, called the Times Reader. It is an application that can be installed on your laptop or other computer devices, which gives the NYT fully readable online and offline, and which is updated automatically by an XML feed. </div><div>Microsoft have tried to create an online reading experience comparable in quality to the print experience. For example, you can click easily to different sections, you can annotate text, you can copy text instantly to blogs, and articles and adverts format to fit the space of different screen-sizes. All this can be navigated offline, so the paper could be read by commuters using handheld devices. </div><br />

Merriam-Webster OnLine (<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/" target="_blank">http://www.merriam-webster.com/</a>), the company's award-winning Web site, has posted a sample of the nearly 100 neologisms that have won entry into the 2006 update of America's best-selling dictionary. Many of these new entries come from the fields of science and technology -- mouse potato is joined by ringtone (n: the sound made by a cell phone to signal an incoming call); spyware (n: software that is installed in a computer without the user's knowledge and transmits information about the user's computer activities over the Internet); and biodiesel (n: a fuel that is similar to diesel fuel and is derived from usually vegetable sources). The sample list also reveals new words from pop culture (soul patch), business and industry (agritourism), and medicine (avian influenza). These newest entries join the more than 10,000 new words and meanings introduced when the groundbreaking Eleventh Edition, the first dictionary to combine a print edition with a CD-ROM and online access, launched in July 2003<p>&nbsp;</p></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" /></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Along with the arrival of these new words, this year Merriam-Webster is also celebrating some distinctive old words. The year 2006 marks the bicentennial anniversary of America's first dictionary -- Noah Webster's A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language. As is true today, a good number of the words introduced in this 1806 volume came from science and technology: caloric, electrician, psychology, and vaccine, along with other now-familiar words like Americanize, chowder, slang, and surf.

When Patrick Gallagher and his wizards help us determine just what those experiences will be, then we&rsquo;ll seek an architect to design the structures around them.</p><p>&ldquo;The Museum Committee was impressed by Gallagher&rsquo;s past work and his team&rsquo;s understanding of what we hope to achieve with this enormous project.&rdquo;</p><p>Gallagher &amp; Associates is a professional design services firm with clients around the world. Among its projects have been the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C.; the American Cemetery Visitor Center in Normandy, France; and the Jamestown Settlement Museum in Williamsburg, Virginia.</p><p>&ldquo;The evolution of the &lsquo;visitor experience&rsquo; in museums today is affected by a variety of factors,&rdquo; said Gallagher principal Patrick Gallagher. &ldquo;The Academy&rsquo;s museum experience must be a distinctive one, and this will require a high degree of integration among stories, artifacts and theater to make the reality fulfilling and enriching.</p><p>&ldquo;Visitors to the museum will arrive with great curiosity and anticipation. It will be important for them to leave with a new understanding of this unique industry and art, an understanding of how movies have affected our culture in the past and how they will continue to influence new generations of filmgoers.&rdquo;</p><p>Land acquisition for the Academy&rsquo;s museum is underway in Hollywood, next to the Academy&rsquo;s existing Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study at North Vine Street and Fountain Avenue. Academy Executive Director Bruce Davis said the Academy hopes to break ground on the museum in early 2009.</p><p>For information about Gallagher &amp; Associates:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;www.gallagherdesign.com<br /></p><p align="center"># # #</p><p class="footer">&copy;A.M.P.A.S.&reg;<br /></p>

Nearly one-third of the company's customer base of 18.6 million in the first quarter already has high-speed access, it said. </p><p>AOL is losing subscribers to high-speed Internet providers at a quickening pace, losing about 850,000 in the first quarter, the Journal said. Total U.S. subscribers at the end of 2002 was 26.5 million, the newspaper said. </p><p>AOL Chief Executive Jonathan Miller presented the proposal to top Time Warner executives in New York last week, the newspaper said. </p>

                              <div class="bo"><strong>Key quotes from Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking in a special interactive webcast, organised by the BBC and Russia's Yandex website on 6 July 2006: </strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>NORTH KOREAN MISSILE TESTS </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>We are disappointed by what's going on. The rights of some cannot be materialised in such a way as to infringe on the rights of others. Tests of this kind cannot be considered normal... [but they] should not lead to such emotions that would drown out commonsense. We should be aiming at reinstating the negotiations process with North Korea [to] arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise </p><p>According to our experts, in order to increase the range of the missiles that North Korea has from 1,000km to 3,500km to 6,000km, they need to take those missiles into outer space to the trajectory of 600km and that is impossible considering the level of the technological development in North Korea - at least for the foreseeable future. Six thousand kilometres is practically impossible. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAMME </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>Of course, we are against the development of any weapons of mass destruction. [As for negotiations,] we cannot wait endlessly - it's counterproductive. But it's even more counterproductive to get the problem into an impasse from where we won't know how to get out. I would prefer this issue to be taken back to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>TIES WITH AMERICA AND BUSH </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>The world has to be multilateral because it is so diverse... Our role is not, as back in the [days of the] Soviet Union, to provide a counterbalance to the United States. </p><p>There are dark and light patches in anyone's life but the main thing is for a politician to be a decent person and I believe President Bush is a decent person... President Bush is one of the people I consider as a friend. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>MILITARY CONSCRIPTION IN RUSSIA </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>We cannot do without conscription for economic reasons but the numbers should come down. From January 2008 the term of service will be 12 months. The number of career soldiers will increase. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>RUSSIA'S MAIN ENEMIES TODAY </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>Only terrorists. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>RUSSIA'S ENERGY EXPORT CLOUT </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>Russia will not give away its resources for peanuts. We now adhere to market principles purely and solely. </p><p>We will agree a price [for gas] with Ukraine like with any country in Western Europe. Moscow is not influencing the price for the gas. Everybody has got to pay a market price so the subsidies... we effectively used to pay are done with - we are not going back to that. If you insist that we supply our gas at cheap prices to Ukraine you are thereby creating an ineffective economy in a country with our help. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>SELF-DETERMINATION FOR BREAKAWAY REGIONS </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>Kosovo [in Serbia] is one thing, but Abkhazia or South Ossetia [both in Georgia] is another thing? That is something we consider not right. The principles have got to be the same. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>CHECHNYA </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>We have extended extensive rights of autonomy to the Chechen Republic... From what I know of history, the UK never held any talks on disintegration or self-disintegration and we are not going to either. </p><p>Was the war in Chechnya worth it? We realised that we would not be left in peace by forces which have nothing in common with the Chechen people. They were talking about creating an Islamic state from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. We don't need that and Europe doesn't need that either. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>THAT TUMMY KISS </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>It was an unplanned meeting [in a recent scene captured on video, Mr Putin kissed a little boy on the stomach after seeing him in a crowd of tourists at the Kremlin] - people just came up and started talking to me. He seemed very independent and serious. At the same time a child is always defenceless and nice. I wanted to cuddle him like a kitten and it came out in this gesture. He seemed so nice - there was nothing really behind that. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>KILLING TERROR SUSPECTS ABROAD </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>This is not a death penalty [sending Russian special forces abroad to kill hostage-takers who killed abducted Russian diplomats in Iraq] - this is a way of counteracting aggression. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>RACISM IN RUSSIA </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>This is a very dangerous thing for Russia because it is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious country. The country is not doing enough to protect foreigners. And there is a lot of education involved, of course. I can understand [those African students] who feel vulnerable and I really feel for them. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>DEMOCRACY IN RUSSIA </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>Without democracy there is no future for Russia. We have made our choice ourselves and we believe that the democratic path is the optimum path for the country. </p><p>We will always support political opposition. The success of an opposition depends not only on it being in opposition, but also on whether it acts in the interests of a sizeable chunk of the population. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>WORLD CUP FINAL </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>I will be rooting for those who show good, classy football. I think both Italy and France are really worthy of being in the finals. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>SOURCES OF PRIDE AND SHAME </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>I think any citizen of Russia has a right to be proud of their country. Russia cannot be viewed separately from other leading countries of the world. There is much to be proud of but the future of our country can only be ensured if we feel ourselves fully fledged members of the world community and, not least of all, the European family, and this what I am aiming at. </p><p>I am not proud of having so many people who are poverty-stricken. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>KGB BACKGROUND </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>As for my service in the KGB, we lived in a different country. Thank God it is now in the past. Working in intelligence you need to be informed about a lot of things and you have to be able to work with people and respect your partners. </p><p><!--Sch1--><strong>THE INTERNET IN RUSSIA </strong><!--Ech1--></p><p>In my view, the fewer restrictions there are, the better</p></div>

It is essential that the construction of the common European home&quot; rests upon that truth, and upon every individual's right to life, respect and religious freedom. &quot;Upon these values it is possible to reach a consensus even with those people who, while not belonging to the Catholic Church, accept the voice of reason and are sensitive to the dictates of natural law.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>The Pope also highlighted that in order to counteract secularization and relativism &quot;tireless announcement of evangelical values is necessary.&quot; In this context, he encouraged the prelates not to be afraid &quot;to show the faithful what the Gospel teaches, putting them on their guard against values that run counter to it, so that your communities can stimulate all of society to pursue the common good and care for the needy.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Pope Benedict went on, &quot;your country is still feeling the consequences of the recent conflict, the negative effects of which are visible not only in the economy but also in the souls of the inhabitants. ... Always be announcers of reconciliation and workers for peace among the citizens of your country, encouraging them to follow the path of Christian reconciliation. Forgiveness frees, in the first place, those who have the courage to grant it.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Benedict XVI called on the Croatian bishops to be &quot;generous in serving the Church and your people, persevering in prayer and full of zeal in announcement.

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sportsbook.com posts odds on the July 16 ESPY awards </strong></p><p>The 14th annual ESPY's air on Sunday, July 16th at 9 p.m. ET, and sportsbook.com, the world's largest online sportsbook and casino has odds on the most popular categories. Lance Armstrong has a talent for winning streaks and he's topped the odds to four-peat as ESPY's Best Male Athlete, he's a 1-2 bet. Annika Sorenstam tops the women's nominees at 5-6.<br /></p><p>&quot;This awards show is a fantastic event for sports fans, it's a celebration of the year's best achievements and the fans get to choose the winners,&quot; said Alex Czajkowski, Sportsbook.com. &quot;Everybody bets, and at Sportsbook.com even in awards season, there is no off-season.&quot;<br /></p><p>Vince Young is Armstrong's greatest challenger according to odds makers, a 7-2 bet, the two-time Rose Bowl MVP could be a favorite among younger voters. NFL rushing record holder Shaun Alexander, the NBA's heir apparent LeBron James and MLB star Albert Pujols are also nominated for the coveted award.<br /></p><p>Seven time ESPY winner Annika Sorenstam continues to dominate the LPGA Tour. In 2005 she posted ten tour wins, including two majors, and has added two more wins in 2006 including the US Open. She'll be challenged by WNBA super star Sheryl Swoopes, snowboarder Hannah Teter and diver Melanie Troxel.<br /></p><p>The ESPY's Best Team award has championship squads from professional and NCAA leagues going head to head. Sportsbook.com lists the 2006 Superbowl winning Pittsburgh Steelers as the front runner at 3-2. The World Series winning White Sox and NBA champion Miami Heat follow closely, just ahead of two NCAA championship teams - The Texas Longhorns, men's football champs, and the Maryland Terrapins, women's basketball champs.<br /></p><p>The mastermind behind every great team gets a nod at the ESPY's too. The Best Coach / Manager award leads off with White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen at 2-1 followed by Superbowl winning coach Bill Cowher at 11-5. Pat Riley is a good bet as well having lead a second franchise to the promised land. They are joined by NCAA Hoops coaches Billy Donovan of the Florida Gators and Jim Larranaga of March Madness' Cinderella squad, George Mason.<br /></p><pre>  2006 ESPY Awards - Best Male Athlete   Lance Armstrong                         1-2   Vince Young                             7-2   Shaun Alexander                         5-1   LeBron James                            7-1   Albert Pujols                           7-1   2006 ESPY Awards - Best Female Athlete   Annika Sorenstam                        5-6   Sheryl Swoopes                          3-2   Hannah Teter                            4-1   Melanie Troxel                          8-1    2006 ESPY Awards - Best Team   Steelers - 06 Superbowl Champs          3-2   White Sox - 05 World Series Champs     12-5   Heat - 06 NBA Champs                   14-5   Univ of Texas - 06 Rose Bowl Champs     3-1   Maryland(Womens) 05-06 NCAA Champs     10-1    2006 ESPY Awards - Best Coach/Manager   Ozzie Guillen (White Sox)               2-1   Bill Cowher (Steelers)                 11-5   Pat Riley (Heat)                       11-5   Billy Donovan (Florida Mens Hoops)      5-1   Jim Larranaga(GMason Mens Hoops)        5-1    For complete NBA odds please visit sportsbook.com   About Sportsbook.com: </pre><p>Sportsbook.com is the largest sportsbook and casino on the planet, where millions of adult Americans bet on sports, play poker and enjoy blackjack and other casino games online in a regulated and licensed jurisdiction.

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>New Public Service Trailer Latest in Cingular's Five-Year Courtesy Campaign </strong></p><p>&nbsp;Lights! Camera! Silence! As movie patrons settle in their seats this July, Wireless Courtesy Month, they may see the debut of a public service trailer directed by and starring Academy Award winning filmmaker Sydney Pollack in cooperation with Cingular Wireless. The trailer promotes of all things -- silence.<br /></p><p>The scene opens with a man in the midst of conducting a personal phone call. Pollack then appears with script in hand, providing stage direction to the caller, who is clearly annoyed that the filmmaker has disturbed him.<br /></p><p>&quot;Oh, I'm sorry -- is my directing interfering with your phone call?&quot; asks Pollack, with more than a hint of sarcasm. &quot;How rude of me!&quot;<br /></p><p>The trailer concludes with the following message: We won't interrupt your phone calls. Please don't interrupt our movies. Silence your cell phones.<br /></p><p>Pollack, director and producer of films including Tootsie and Out of Africa, said he agreed to participate in the project because cell phone use at the movies &quot;is not only disrespectful to the film and filmmakers, but also to the audience that is there to concentrate on the film.&quot;<br /></p><p>&quot;Much to my humiliation, I've been an unthinking perpetuator of this distracting behavior myself,&quot; Pollack added. &quot;Once I was onstage, participating in an interview in front of a live audience, when my cell phone rang.&quot; Embarrassed, Pollack took the call and tried to make a joke of it. &quot;Now I remember to turn off my cell phone whenever I walk into a public forum.&quot;<br /></p><p>Pollack is also responding to the sentiments of movie audiences. In a survey conducted last year by Braun Research for Cingular, 93 percent of movie-goers said there should be on-screen messages that ask people to turn off their wireless phones in the theater, and 97 percent said they would comply if they saw such a reminder. While 67 percent of movie-goers insisted that their cell phone has never gone off at the movies, nearly one-third admitted they were guilty of the gaffe.<br /></p><p>&quot;I was also intrigued that a company asked me to film a spot urging the public not to use its service,&quot; said Pollack.<br /></p><p>The trailer, dubbed &quot;Cliche,&quot; that was created by BBDO New York and BBDO Atlanta on behalf of Cingular, will air in Regal, United, Edwards, and AMC Loews theaters nationwide. It is the latest in Cingular's longstanding &quot;Be Sensible&quot; public education campaign, which encourages the safe and courteous use of wireless devices. Now in its fifth year, the courtesy component of the campaign includes public service announcements, auditorium signs, messages on popcorn bags, and other tools that encourage film-goers to silence their cell phones at the movies.<br /></p><p>&quot;We decided to focus our courtesy campaign on movie theaters because our research showed that, second only to houses of worship, the place that Americans least want to be disturbed by a ringing phone is at the movies,&quot; said Tim Klein, vice president of public relations for Cingular Wireless. &quot;We've also found that the vast majority of film-goers take action to silence a cell phone after watching one of our public service trailers. Clearly, most people want to be courteous -- they just need a little reminder.&quot;<br /></p><p>&quot;Cingular continues to lead the wireless industry in promoting cell phone courtesy, and its efforts make a difference,&quot; added Cliff Marks, president of sales and marketing for National CineMedia, the media and marketing venture of AMC Entertainment Inc., Cinemark USA and Regal Entertainment Group theatres. &quot;We're delighted with this humorous new announcement, which is sure to resonate with audiences. It underscores our exhibitors' own efforts to create a favorable theater environment so our customers can fully enjoy the films.&quot;<br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                              <p>A mysterious pirate ship has landed at Disney's private island, Castaway Cay, providing Disney Cruise Line guests with a swashbuckling photo opportunity and a sneak peek into movie- making magic.<br /></p><p>Starting in early July guests sailing on a Disney Cruise Line vacation will discover a 175-foot ghost ship anchored at Castaway Cay. The ship is the Flying Dutchman, which makes its silver screen debut on July 7 in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. The Flying Dutchman's commander is the legendary Davy Jones, who serves as nemesis to the infamous pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, in the upcoming film.<br /></p><p>&quot;The Pirates of the Caribbean movie franchise is extremely popular, and having the Flying Dutchman ship at Castaway Cay is something truly unique that only Disney Cruise Line could offer guests,&quot; said Disney Cruise Line President Tom McAlpin.<br /></p><p>The intricate film prop is unlike any other pirate ship -- with ragged sails and a barnacle-encrusted bow, the ship looks like it was raised off the ocean floor to haunt the open seas for eternity. The Flying Dutchman will provide a scenic photo backdrop, and guests renting boats on the island will be able to get an up-close look at the ghost ship.<br /></p><p>While visiting Castaway Cay, guests should also be on the lookout for the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow. With the Flying Dutchman lurking just off the shore, the eccentric captain may be spotted around the island. Guests are encouraged to approach the hero and hear his tales about adventure on the high seas. The charming pirate graciously accepts requests for portraits and autographs -- if guests can manage to track him down.<br /></p><p>Disney Cruise Line will also hold a PremEAR at Sea of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest in the Walt Disney Theatre of both the Disney Magic and Disney Wonder. On Friday, July 7, guests aboard Disney Cruise Line will receive commemorative buttons and pirate-themed temporary tattoos and will be invited to view the premiere of the film at 12:01 a.m.<br /></p><p>The addition of the Flying Dutchman to Castaway Cay will enhance what already is a highlight of a Disney Cruise Line vacation. This summer, Disney Cruise Line is offering special rates for Florida residents, making it even easier for them to experience the excitement of a Disney cruise. On select sailings throughout the summer, Florida residents can take a 3-night cruise starting at $499 per person and a 4-night sailing starting at $649 per person.<br /></p><p>To learn more about Disney Cruise Line or to book a vacation, guests can contact their travel agent, visit <a href="http://www.disneycruise.com/" target="_newbrowser">http://www.disneycruise.com/</a> or call Disney Cruise Line at (888) DCL-2500.

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>'Testimony: Vol. 1, Life &amp; Relationship' In Stores Now </strong></p><p>&nbsp;12-time Grammy nominee India.Arie enters the Billboard Top 200 Albums Chart this week at #1 with her third studio album Testimony: Vol. 1, Life &amp; Relationship on Universal Motown Records. The acclaimed release was produced by longtime collaborators Shannon Sanders and Mark Batson (Seal, Beyonce), among others and has been receiving universal critical acclaim. Entertainment Weekly says &quot;Testimony may just be your cup of decaffeinated jasmine tea&quot; while VIBE Magazine describes it as &quot;pensive and poetic,&quot; The album's first video, &quot;I Am Not My Hair,&quot; helmed by Barnaby Roper (Moby, Razorlight) has become a staple on both VH1 and BET.<br /></p><p>&quot;This is a great milestone for India.Arie and the entire Universal Motown team,&quot; stated Sylvia Rhone, President of Universal Motown Records. &quot;The #1 debut of Testimony ... is a powerful testament to the unique bond she has with her audience, as well as affirming India.Arie's rightful place as one of our culture's most uplifting and empowering artists.&quot;<br /></p><p>Testimony ... is also being hailed as a more personal expression from the singer/songwriter, with People Magazine calls the CD &quot;inspirational&quot; and Glamour Magazine names it among &quot;Songs to Download Now&quot; in their July 2006 issue.

A masterful meditation on self-acceptance and womanhood, she was dubbed the new &quot;neo-soulstress&quot; by no less than Newsweek Magazine, praising her as &quot;one of the freshest talents to come out of 2001,&quot; the emotive singer went on to be nominated for seven Grammys for her debut album, and subsequently has won a host of awards including 2 Grammys, 3 NAACP Awards, as well as being recognized by BET, Billboard Magazine, MTV, VH1 and Essence Magazine, among others.<br /></p><p>2002's Voyage To India cemented her rep as a seminal singer/songwriter, netting her 4 Grammy nominations and two statues. With more than six million albums sold, she most recently was nominated for her 12th Grammy in the Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals category for her writing collaboration with Stevie Wonder on the title song of his most recent album, A Time To Love.<br /></p><p>India.Arie is also a U.S. Ambassador for UNICEF and is universally recognized as a tireless champion of social and humanitarian causes around the world.

                              <p>&nbsp;The Firm, Hollywood's most innovative management company, announced today it is launching a new artist-friendly music company, with records to be distributed by EMI Music in the U.S. and licensed for territories around the globe.<br /></p><p>The new music company will take the unprecedented step of splitting all profits with the artists signed to the venture rather than the traditional royalty structure. Multi-platinum recording artist and actress Mandy Moore and rock group Army of Anyone, featuring former members of Filter and Stone Temple Pilots, are the first to sign to the company.<br /></p><p>Jeff Kwatinetz, CEO of The Firm and architect of the new music venture, said, &quot;This is an opportunity for The Firm to create a new music business model that shifts power back to the artists and the focus back to the music itself. While many in the music industry are pessimistic about the future, we think the possibilities are limitless if we can find fresh ways to support and nurture great art and the talent that creates it.&quot;<br /></p><p>&quot;The innovative work we have done with David Munns, Alain Levy and their team at EMI on Korn, Ice Cube, 30 Seconds to Mars and others has been lighting the way. They are forward thinkers whose artist-oriented approach is empowering the creative community. Instead of whining about the difficulties plaguing today's music business, they are planning for the future,&quot; Kwatinetz added.<br /></p><p>The financial model created for the company is the latest in a series of deals by The Firm that are reengineering entertainment industry economics to strengthen common interests between artists and the companies they work with.<br /></p><p>As a consequence of these deals, The Firm has been evolving into a unique new kind of Hollywood company with the capacity not only to manage the careers of film and music artists, but to produce, market and promote their craft.<br /></p><p>A number of those groundbreaking deals have been supported by EMI Music, the world's third largest recorded music company.<br /></p><p>&quot;EMI is delighted to distribute The Firm's music company in the U.S. and bring its artists to a global audience. The Firm's label roster will be another strong American repertoire source for EMI worldwide,&quot; said David Munns, Vice Chairman EMI Music worldwide. &quot;Jeff shares my view that our changing industry sometimes calls for breaking the mold and pursuing new business models. As a result, we're already having success with the groundbreaking deal we did with The Firm on Korn and we look forward to this being another solid venture.&quot;<br /></p><p>Last year, The Firm engineered an innovative deal that put EMI and Live Nation in partnership with the band Korn so that all parties benefit from the rock group's overall success. Korn's first record under the agreement, &quot;See You on the Other Side,&quot; is fast approaching 2 million units sold worldwide, and the band's touring numbers are exceeding expectations.<br /></p><p>In another recent deal with EMI, Firm client Ice Cube self-financed a new album and The Firm handled such record company functions as A&amp;R, marketing, promotion and publicity for the newly created Lench Mob Records, while EMI handled distribution. The album, &quot;Laugh Now, Cry Later,&quot; debuted top 5 in the U.S. three weeks ago.<br /></p><p>Mandy Moore said: &quot;The current state of the industry challenges us to conceive innovative approaches in music. It is, therefore, especially exciting to be part of a venture in which artistic freedom is encouraged. I am thrilled by the opportunity to join forces with The Firm, as well as with those I've trusted throughout the years.&quot;<br /></p><p>Army of Anyone said: &quot;We are so excited to be a part of the building of a new business model. We have been looking for a way to regain some artistic control, and we feel by partnering with The Firm, we are truly betting on ourselves and our team. For the first time in our career, we are in control of our own destiny.&quot;<br /></p><p>The Firm's music clients have excelled recently and currently are responsible for 9 of the top 100 and 11 of the top 200 records on the Billboard chart. Meanwhile, The Firm is aggressively signing new artists including &quot;American Idol&quot; winner Taylor Hicks, and is successfully breaking new acts including Flyleaf and 30 Seconds to Mars, who are signed to EMI's Virgin Records.<br /></p><p>The new music company, which has not yet been named, will be housed within the Firm's Beverly Hills management offices. <br /></p>

Available on DVD October 3, 2006 from Universal Studios Home Entertainment, American Dreamz takes audiences on a wild ride through the absurd world of reality talent competitions. Featuring an all-star ensemble cast including Mandy Moore (Saved), Chris Klein (American Pie), Marcia Gay Harden (Mona Lisa Smile) and two-time Academy Award(R) nominee Willem Dafoe (Inside Man), the film sets the stage for the most shocking and wildly funny talent showdown the country has ever seen.<br /></p><p>Hosted by a foul-mouthed, egomaniacal scoundrel (Hugh Grant), &quot;American Dreamz&quot; is the number one television program in America, a real-life talent show that allows singing hopefuls to compete for instant fame. When the President of the United States (Dennis Quaid) agrees to be a judge for the show's finale, a ruthlessly ambitious young woman from America's heartland (Mandy Moore) faces off against a show tune loving immigrant (newcomer Sam Golzari) with potentially explosive results. The DVD is priced at $29.98. Preorder close is August 15, 2006.<br /></p><p>American Critics Sing Praises of &quot;American Dreamz&quot;<br /></p><p>&quot;American Dreamz&quot; won over reviewers from coast to coast, who stopped laughing just long enough to applaud its hilarious take on contemporary values. It is &quot;an outrageously funny film,&quot; raves Pete Hammond of Maxim. &quot;A funny and engaging movie!&quot; gushes Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly. Thelma Adams of US Weekly crows, &quot;A riot!&quot;<br /></p><p>Synopsis<br /></p><p>On the morning of his re-election, the President of the United States (Dennis Quaid) decides to read the newspaper for the first time in four years, starting him down a slippery slope. He holes up in his bedroom, reading obsessively and reexamining his black and white view of the world. Frightened by the President's apparent nervous breakdown, his chief of staff (Willem Dafoe) pushes him back into the spotlight by booking him as a guest judge on the weekly talent show and television ratings juggernaut &quot;American Dreamz.&quot;<br /></p><p>America can't seem to get enough of the show, which is hosted by self- aggrandizing, self-loathing Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), ever on the lookout for the next insta-celebrity. His latest crop of hopefuls includes Sally (Mandy Moore), a conniving all-American girl with a devoted, dopey veteran boyfriend (Chris Klein), and Omer, a recent Southern Californian immigrant who just happens to be a bumbling, show tune singing, would-be terrorist awaiting activation. When both Sally and Omer make it to the final round, where the President will be judging along with Tweed, the stage is set for a show the nation will never forget.<br /></p><pre>  For more information please visit: www.americandreamzmovie.com     CAST &amp; FILMMAKERS   Written, Directed and Produced By: Paul Weitz   Produced By:  Rodney Liber, Andrew Miano   Executive Producers: Chris Weitz, Kerry Kohansky   Director of Photography: Robert Elswit ASC   Production Designer: William Arnold   Edited By: Myron Kerstein   Costume Designer: Molly Maginnis   Original Score by: Stephen Trask   Cast: Hugh Grant, Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore, Marcia Gay Harden, Chris    Klein, Jennifer Coolidge, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Judy Greer, John Cho, and    Willem Dafoe    TECHNICAL INFORMATION   DVD   Street Date: October 3, 2006   Pre-Order Close: August 15, 2006   Copyright: 2006 Universal Studios.

The Bible Experience, a dramatized audio recording of the Bible featuring more than 100 celebrities, renowned and ordained clergy, and notable personalities.<br /></p><p>Recorded at Technicolor Studios in Burbank, California, production of the landmark project commenced in December of 2005. With over 1,500 recording hours logged over more than 100 days, production of the New Testament has wrapped as scheduled on June 26, 2006. Based on Today's New International Version (TNIV), a translation distributed by Zondervan, the world's leading Bible publisher, the dramatized recording of the entire text of the New Testament is scheduled for release October 2006. Inspired By Media Group, producers of the project, selected the TNIV version based on its superior combination of accuracy and readability. The goal of utilizing the TNIV is to increase the audio Bible's reach to the 18-to-34 demographic while simultaneously creating a product that will appeal to the mature consumer.<br /></p><p>&quot;We are focused on the goal of engaging the hearts and minds of today's generation,&quot; said Ron Belk, executive producer and one of four of Inspired By ...

Lostprophets 2001 debut, Fake Sound of Progress, peaked at #44 while the band's 2004 Start Something reached #4.<br /></p><p>&quot;Rooftops (A Liberation Broadcast),&quot; the first single from Liberation Transmission, hit the UK Top 10 (#8). Lostprophets will tour England through July with a show planned for Cardiff International Arena in the group's native Wales.<br /></p><p>Back in the states, Liberation Transmission has just debuted at #33 on the Billboard Top 200 bestselling albums chart, mirroring the US debut (also #33 in the Top 200) the week after Start Something was released in February 2004.<br /></p><p>Lostprophets, Liberation Transmission, and &quot;Rooftops&quot; are already making waves with the stateside music press. &quot;The mix of pop-punk dynamics, classic rock riffage, and hair metal flourishes is well-executed,&quot; enthuses Will Hermes in Entertainment Weekly (July 23, 2006) while Billboard's (June 10, 2006) Sven Phillip raved about the single, writing, &quot;'Rooftops' has already raised the roof at modern and active rock radio, ensuring that these Welsh prophets will not get lost.&quot;<br /></p><p>Liberation Transmission, the first Lostprophets album since 2004's RIAA gold-certified Start Something, is produced by Bob Rock (whose work on Metallica's self-titled &quot;black album&quot; is much admired by Lostprophets). Tracks for Liberation Transmission were recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood and Rock's Plantation Recording in Maui, Hawaii and mixed at The Warehouse in Vancouver.<br /></p><p>&quot;Rooftops (A Liberation Broadcast),&quot; the album's first single, comes with a video lensed in Los Angeles and co-directed by the band and Ryan Smith (Story of the Year, Good Charlotte, Bowling For Soup).<br /></p><p>Liberation Transmission premieres 12 new Lostprophets songs: &quot;Everyday Combat,&quot; &quot;A Town Called Hypocrisy,&quot; &quot;The New Transmission,&quot; &quot;Rooftops (A Liberation Broadcast),&quot; &quot;Can't Stop, Gotta Date With Hate,&quot; &quot;Can't Catch Tomorrow (Good Shoes Won't Save You This Time),&quot; &quot;Everybody's Screaming!!!,&quot; &quot;Broken Hearts, Torn Up Letters and the Story of a Lonely Girl,&quot; &quot;4:AM Forever,&quot; &quot;For All These Times Kid, For All These Times,&quot; &quot;Heaven For The Weather, Hell For The Company,&quot; &quot;Always All Ways (Apologies, Glances and Messed Up Chances).&quot;<br /></p><p>Lostprophets are Ian Watkins (vocals), Mike Lewis (guitar), Lee Gaze (guitar), Stuart Richardson (bass) and Jamie Oliver (keyboards, programming).<br /></p><pre>   <a href="http://www.lostprophets.com/" target="_newbrowser">http://www.lostprophets.com/</a>   <a href="http://www.myspace.com/lostprophets" target="_newbrowser">http://www.myspace.com/lostprophets</a>   <a href="http://www.columbiarecords.com/" target="_newbrowser">http://www.columbiarecords.com/</a>  </pre><p><span class="label">Source: </span>Columbia Records </p>

Bright and balanced, with velvety smooth texture and lovely sweetness, Las Hermanas coffee celebrates the great care that these &quot;sisters&quot; invest in quality. Las Hermanas coffee is available for a limited time while supplies last.<br /></p><p>To meet Peet's high standards, the women of Las Hermanas invest heavily in training and education, operating their own cupping lab to monitor all aspects of production and cup quality. Women are taught the fundamentals of cupping and processing and taste their own coffees at least three times during harvest. In doing so, they gain an understanding of how cultivation practices affect the cup, challenge themselves to improve their methods of coffee production and ultimately, earn better prices.<br /></p><p>&quot;These extraordinary women continue to make their mark on the world of coffee,&quot; said Doug Welsh, vice president of coffee, Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea, Inc. &quot;By caring for their coffee in such a meticulous way they are improving the quality of their lives and are investing back into their communities.&quot;<br /></p><p>The women of Las Hermanas are now in their fifth year of a premium priced contract with Peet's. As a result of Peet's yearly purchases, these women have been able to secure loans and obtain additional low-interest, pre-harvest financing. Through the sale of their coffee and in partnership with their cooperative, they have also established a community pharmacy with access to lower priced medicines, and constructed more schools as well as more community libraries to support child and adult literacy.<br /></p><p>Availability<br /></p><p>Las Hermanas coffee is priced at $12.95 per pound and will be available for a limited time at all Peet's retail stores nationwide, online at www.peets.com and by calling 1-800-999-2132.<br /></p><p>About Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea, Inc.<br /></p><p>Founded in Berkeley, Calif. in 1966, Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea, Inc. is a specialty coffee roaster and marketer of fresh, deep-roasted whole bean coffee for home and office enjoyment.

The survey further explores how much retired couples say they argue over finances, how current living expenses in retirement compare with what retirees expected, and how much income those who are not retired believe they and their spouse/partner need annually in order to retire comfortably.<br /></p><p>These are some of the results of an online survey of 2,075 U.S. adults conducted by Harris Interactive(R) between May 30 and June 1, 2006 for The Wall Street Journal Online's Personal Journal Edition.<br /></p><pre>  Use of money in the later years    - If adults had one choice with what to do with their money in their later     years, the likelihood that they say they would continue to support the     lifestyle they have now increases with age, while the likelihood that     they say they would use the money to travel, buy a vacation home or     relocate to a warmer climate decreases with age.    - Men are more likely than women to say they would continue to support the     lifestyle they have now (47% vs. 35%, respectively).    - Those who are single or have never been married are substantially more     likely than those who are married/living with a partner or     divorced/separated/widowed to say they would use the money to travel,     buy a vacation home or relocate to a warmer climate (32% vs. 24% and     20%, respectively).    Saving for retirement    - The level of agreement about how much they need to save for retirement     rises with age and income, presumably because as couples near retirement     they feel compelled to discuss their plans.    - Interestingly, men are more likely to focus on saving for retirement     than women (both men and women admit this is the case in their     relationship).    Arguing over finances </pre><p>Over half (54%) of retirees who are married or living with a partner say they argue about their finances about the same amount as they used to, and 41 percent say they argue less than they did before they retired.<br /></p><p>&quot;Money has long been known as a source of conflict among couples. The good news is that when couples reach retirement they argue about finances much less than they did while working,&quot; states Anne Aldrich, Senior Vice President of the Financial Services Research Practice at Harris Interactive. &quot;Moving into this stage of life takes planning and communication -- when couples take the time to work through their plans conflict can be reduced.&quot;<br /></p><p>The notion of saving for retirement is one that is too much for some couples -- about one in 10 say that neither of them can decide on how much to save for that stage in their life.<br /></p><p>Current living expenses vs. expectations<br /></p><p>Over one-third (37%) of retired adults have experienced higher living expenses than they expected they would have, and this rises to nearly one out of two in the West (49%) and of those who are divorced/separated or widowed (49%) who say this.<br /></p><pre>  - On average, adults who are not retired believe they and their     spouse/partner need $75,233 annually in order to retire comfortably.     Predictably, this number increases when responses are compared by     household income.  </pre><p>According to Aldrich, &quot;The outlook on spending becomes more realistic with age. Priorities shift with different life stages, and it is important for financial advisors and those in the financial services industry to be aware of their clients' needs and motivations as they near retirement so they can provide guidance that is personally relevant.&quot;<br /></p><pre>                                 TABLE 1                               MARITAL STATUS                       &quot;What is your marital status?&quot;   Base: All adults                                                            Total                                                             %   Married/Living with Partner (Net)                        60     Married                                                53     Living with partner                                     6   Single, never married                                    27   Divorced                                                  8   Separated                                                 1   Widowed                                                   4                                    TABLE 2                             EMPLOYMENT STATUS                        &quot;Which best describes you?&quot;   Base: All adults                                                              Those Married/                                                 Total    Living with Partner                                                   %              %   I am retired from my primary occupation        25             29   I am not retired                               75             71                                     TABLE 3A                    USE OF MONEY IN LATER YEARS - BY AGE </pre><p>&quot;If you had only one choice, what would you do with your money in your later<br /></p><pre>                                 years?&quot;   Base: All adults                                        Total                 Age                                                18-34   35-44   45-54     55+                                         %        %       %       %        %   Continue to support the lifestyle    I have now                          40       25      37      42       57   Use the money to travel, buy a    vacation home or relocate to a    warmer climate                      26       34      32      25       15   Save it to pay for health care    and long-term care expenses         15       17      19      15       12   Leave an inheritance for my    children or grandchildren           14       16       9      14       13   Other                                 5        8       3       3        3    Note: Percentages may not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.

Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was also used to adjust for respondents' propensity to be online.<br /></p><p>All surveys are subject to several sources of error. These include: sampling error (because only a sample of a population is interviewed); measurement error due to question wording and/or question order, deliberately or unintentionally inaccurate responses, nonresponse (including refusals), interviewer effects (when live interviewers are used) and weighting.<br /></p><p>With one exception (sampling error) the magnitude of the errors that result cannot be estimated. There is, therefore, no way to calculate a finite &quot;margin of error&quot; for any survey and the use of these words should be avoided.<br /></p><p>With pure probability samples, with 100 percent response rates, it is possible to calculate the probability that the sampling error (but not other sources of error) is not greater than some number. With a pure probability sample of 2,075 adults one could say with a 95 percent probability that the overall results have a sampling error of +/- 3 percentage points. Sampling error for the various sub-samples shown in the tables is higher and varies. However that does not take other sources of error into account. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no theoretical sampling error can be calculated.<br /></p><p>These statements conform to the principles of disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls.<br /></p><p>About the Survey<br /></p><p>The Wall Street Journal Online/Harris Interactive Personal Finance Poll is an exclusive poll that is published in the Personal Journal Edition of The Wall Street Journal Online at www.wsj.com/personaljournal.<br /></p><p>About The Wall Street Journal Online<br /></p><p>The Wall Street Journal Online at WSJ.com, published by Dow Jones &amp; Company (NYSE: DJ; www.dowjones.com), is the largest paid subscription news site on the Web.

                              <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr class="ccbnBgTtl"><td valign="top"><span class="ccbnTtl" /></td></tr><tr class="ccbnBgTxt"><td valign="top"><span class="ccbnTxt"><p>Hotels are always looking for new ways to attract guests, particularly during the busy summer travel season. As a result, more and more hotels are allowing guests to bring their pets with them when they vacation. In fact, AAA estimates that the number of hotels that accept pets has increased by 28 percent since 2003.</p><p>Considering that the Travel Industry Association of America (TIA) has found that more than 29 million Americans take trips of more than 50 miles with their pets, lenient pet policies have the potential to mean big business to those hotels that cater to animals. But accommodating guests and their pets has come with a learning curve to which thousands of hoteliers across America have had to adapt.</p><p>&quot;There are more families traveling with their pets today than there were a few years ago,&quot; said Andrew Crum, general manager of the Hampton Inn Eastgate in Cincinnati, Ohio. &quot;People who travel with their animals think of their pets as their family, and want to stay in places where they can keep their pet with them when they travel.&quot;</p><p>According to TIA, of those pet friendly travelers, 80 percent bring their dog; 15 percent bring their cat; and the remaining percent bring birds, ferrets, rabbits or fish. The pet policy at the Hampton Inn Eastgate allows for small pets up to 50 pounds of any species from dogs and cats to boa constrictors, mice and parrots.</p><p>But there are challenges associated with accepting even the smallest canine, feline, reptilian or winged friends. Challenges Crum has faced range from the expected -- occasional noise complaints or guests who bring their animals with them to the breakfast bar in the morning -- to the expensive.</p><p>&quot;We've had a few bad experiences,&quot; Crum recalled. &quot;We've had dogs that haven't been kenneled and have chewed through bedspreads, torn holes in the carpet, scratched the door and destroyed a box spring mattress.&quot;</p><p>Debra Bullock, director of housekeeping for the Brown Palace Hotel in Denver, Colo. has experienced similar problems. &quot;We've had to replace the duvet covers, sheets and terry products in our guest rooms,&quot; she said. &quot;We've also had housekeeping go to clean a room, open the door and have a dog escape into the hotel. That was definitely a challenge!&quot;</p><p>Some of Crum's animal experiences have been a bit more exotic. &quot;We had guests staying with us once who kept their parrot in their room,&quot; Crum continued. &quot;The cage wasn't properly latched, and when housekeeping entered the room to clean it, the bird got loose into the hotel. We ended up chasing the parrot around the hotel for about an hour before we finally caught it with a pillow case.&quot;</p><p>Cleaning up after hotel guests and their pets is also a challenge that hoteliers must face. Housekeeping practices often have to be adjusted to accommodate pet owners.</p><p>&quot;Carpet and upholstery -- that is usually where we experience the most problems,&quot; Bullock said. &quot;Dog hair gets all over the place, so we often have to vacuum repeatedly. If a dog urinates in the room, the carpet usually has to be shampooed several times to get the smell out. We use an enzyme-based cleaner to get all the way down to the pad, but the smell stays for a while. We will usually keep a room out of order until we can completely remove the smell.&quot;</p><p>Crum said that the thorough cleaning policy of the Hampton Inn helps to eliminate cleaning problems caused by pets. &quot;Our carpets are shampooed bi- monthly, and all of our bedcovers -- sheets, pillowcases, blankets and duvets -- are washed daily with Tide, Clorox and Downy products, which rid sheets of any lingering odors,&quot; Crum said. &quot;We also use Febreze, which helps to eliminate odors left in the room.&quot;</p><p>Clearly, allowing pets into their properties has great profit potential for hoteliers. &quot;As the number of travelers with pets continues to rise, it becomes even more essential for hoteliers to have quality, high-performing cleaning programs in place,&quot; said Craig Monsell of the P&amp;G Pro Line Lodging Program, an on-premise laundry and in-room cleaning program that is designed to increase guest satisfaction.</p><p>&quot;With cleanliness always being paramount in the guest satisfaction quotient, hoteliers must effectively address the unique cleaning challenges posed by pets,&quot; said Monsell. &quot;A cleaning program built around trusted brands that offer outstanding performance and get the job done right the first time can go far in addressing these challenges.&quot;</p><p>About P&amp;G (NYSE: PG)</p><p>Three billion times a day, P&amp;G brands touch the lives of people around the world.

There's so much emotion, yet with a beautiful and kind delivery.&quot; </p><p>Following several years honing her skills living and working in Northern California, the now Los Angeles-based Lyons says -- in her musical, Irish-lilted voice, &quot;The more naked you are with your emotions, the more you can connect with other people.&quot; Throughout &quot;I Will,&quot; that intense connection is visceral on stand-out tracks including the first single &quot;Don't You Know&quot; (serviced to AAA radio), title track &quot;I Will&quot; and &quot;Save Me,&quot; the last dealing with Lyons' health issues related to airborne toxins, which have inspired her to become an environmental activist. </p><p>&quot;I Will&quot; is slated for release July 25th on Mythic Records and West 57th Street Entertainment, the latter company recently launched by music industry veterans Mason Munoz and Louis Levin, with offices in New York City and Weston, CT. Distribution will be through top independent music distributor Alternative Distribution Alliance (ADA). The ten-song disc features tracks produced by KC Porter as well as ones by Canadian Juno Award winner Greg Kavanagh, and was mixed by venerable GRAMMY winning engineer Ed Cherney. </p><p>&quot;I Will&quot; follows up her first album &quot;Surrender,&quot; released in 2002 on Vapor Records, about which Billboard Magazine wrote, &quot;With the impressive debut &quot;Surrender,&quot; singer/tunesmith Tracy Lyons proves that she has a knack for wrapping strong words in a velvet glove.&quot; That CD's single &quot;Love Hurts&quot; drew national radio attention, and led to concert gigs opening for Kenny Loggins, Dave Mason, Shawn Colvin and Los Lonely Boys, among other artists, and the lead slot on the &quot;green&quot;-themed summer 2004 tour SHOW: The Renewable Hydrogen Roadshow, which played major festivals throughout California. </p><p>Part of the fourth generation of an illustrious Irish clan of musical/theatrical performers, Tracy's upbringing includes years spent in Northern Ireland where her family hails from, and in an Irish expatriate community outside Toronto, Canada. Her songcraft grew out of her love of writing poetry, which she pursued from an early age. Recently, Lyons commented that &quot;The poetry I wrote, for whatever reason, never seemed complete. When I took it to the piano and started plunking away, I thought, 'This makes sense,' and it all started to evolve.&quot; Her artistry really came into focus when she eventually started strumming her creations -- &quot;Writing on a guitar is a little freer for me,&quot; says Tracy. &quot;It's more driving, there's a different energy.&quot; </p><p>That energy has been building steadily, and, with a voice and spirit that is both intimate and assertive, brings on the powerful &quot;soft storm&quot; of Tracy Lyon's new album &quot;I Will.&quot; </p><p>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.tracylyons.com/" target="_blank">www.tracylyons.com</a> </p>

Peter Pace was asked for his reaction to a former soldier being arrested in North Carolina yesterday and charged with rape and murder, as well as other recent allegations being investigated.<br /><br />&quot;It is unfortunate when some folks are accused of doing those kinds of <br />things, but it just reinforces to the 99.9 percent of the American <br />fighting men and women who are serving with honor, serving with dignity, <br />serving this country as well as you'd expect them to, that they are the <br />ones who are serving properly,&quot; the general told Harry Smith on CBS's <br />&quot;Early Show.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And for those who stray, if they have, we will investigate and we will <br />take proper action,&quot; the chairman added.<br /><br />On NBC's &quot;Today&quot; program, Pace told Ann Curry that the incidents don't <br />reflect the military's values. &quot;Any such acts on the part of any U.S. <br />servicemember, if proven to be true, are totally unacceptable,&quot; he said. <br />&quot;We know that in uniform, and all of our fellow citizens know that.&quot;<br /><br />The general noted that allegations against the former soldier and other <br />members of his unit came to light in a post-deployment counseling <br />session.<br /><br />&quot;We make available to families, to soldiers and Marines, counseling <br />after they've left the battlefield to ensure that their mental health is <br />as good as their physical health,&quot; he told Smith. &quot;I understand it was <br />during one of these counseling sessions that this latest accusation came <br />out. So, again, we've had over a million who have served in the Gulf.&nbsp; <br />And it is unacceptable that anybody would do anything like these folks <br />are accused of.<br /><br />&quot;But if they have,&quot; he continued, &quot;they will be dealt with.&nbsp; And the <br />vast majority of American servicemen and women should be proud of how <br />they are serving this nation.&quot;<br /><br />

To begin, let me say how appropriate it is that this hearing is taking place here in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Two hundred and thirty years ago yesterday, just around the corner from here, our founding fathers adopted the greatest statement on the right to self-government ever written. Among those who signed the Declaration of Independence were nine immigrants, and at every other crucial stage in American history - from ratification of the Constitution to the Civil War to the Industrial Revolution to the computer age - immigrants have propelled America to greatness.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Today, we remain a nation of immigrants.&nbsp; People from around the world continue to come here seeking opportunity, and they continue to make America the most dynamic nation in the world.&nbsp; But it's clear we also have a problem on our hands - our immigration laws are fundamentally broken.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It's as if we expect border control agents to do what a century of communism could not: defeat the natural market forces of supply and demand and defeat the natural human desire for freedom and opportunity. You might as well sit in your beach chair and tell the tide not to come in.</p><p>&quot;As long as America remains a nation dedicated to the proposition that 'all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,' people from near and far will continue to seek entry into our country.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;New York City alone is home to more than three million immigrants, who make up nearly 40 percent of our entire population.&nbsp; About 500,000 came to our City - and continue to come - illegally.</p><p>&quot;And let's be honest: they arrive for a good reason - they want a better life for themselves and their families, and our businesses need them and hire them!&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Although they broke the law by illegally crossing our borders or overstaying their visas, and our businesses broke the law by employing them our City's economy would be a shell of itself had they not, and it would collapse if they were deported. The same holds true for the nation.</p><p>&quot;For our children to have a bright future, two things are true: a strong America needs a constant source of new immigrants.&nbsp; And in a post-9/11 world, a secure America needs to make sure that those immigrants arrive here legally.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We have a right - and a duty - to encourage people to come, and at the same time, to ensure that no one who is on a terrorist watch list sneaks into our country.&nbsp; Right now, we neither invite those we want, nor keep out those we don't. If we are going to both strengthen our national security and keep our economy growing, you - our elected legislators - must devise a comprehensive approach to immigration reform.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I believe that such an approach must embody four key principles:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) reducing incentives; 2) creating more lawful opportunity; 3) reducing illegal access; and 4) accepting reality.&nbsp; Allow me to me briefly outline each of them.</p><p>&quot;First, we must reduce the incentive to come here illegally. As a business owner, I know the absurdity of our existing immigration regulations all too well. Employers are required to check the status of all job applicants, but not to do anything more than eyeball their documents.&nbsp; In fact, hypocritically, under Federal law that Congress wrote, employers are not even permitted to ask probing questions. As a result, fake 'Green cards' are a dime a dozen - you can buy one for 40 bucks.&nbsp; Fake Social Security cards are also easily obtained.&nbsp; And for $50 cash, you can get both cards.&nbsp; Such a deal!</p><p>&quot;As most members of the U.S. Senate recognize, we absolutely must have a Federal database that will allow employers to verify the status of all job applicants.&nbsp; But for this database to have any value, we must also ensure that the documentation job applicants present is incorruptible.&nbsp; That means we need to create a bio-metric employment card containing unique information - fingerprints or DNA, for instance.</p><p>&quot;Every current job holder or applicant would be required to obtain a card, and every business would be required to check its validity against the Federal database. In theory, we already have such a card - it's called your Social Security card.&nbsp; But being a government product, naturally, its technology is way behind the times.</p><p>&quot;By taking advantage of current technology, we can provide the Federal government with the tools necessary to enforce our immigration laws and protect workers from exploitative and abusive conditions. I want to be clear that this is not a national ID card, as some have suggested.&nbsp; This would be an employment card for the 21st Century.&nbsp; If you don't work, you don't need a card.&nbsp; But everyone who works would need to have an employment card.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;There must also be stiff penalties for businesses that fail to conduct checks or ignore their results.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Holding businesses accountable is the crucial step, because it is the only way to reduce the incentive to come here illegally. Requiring employers to verify citizenship status was the promise of the 1986 immigration reform law.&nbsp; But it was an empty promise, never enforced by the Federal government.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The failure to enforce the law was largely in response to pressure from businesses - which is understandable, because businesses needed access to a larger labor supply than Federal immigration laws allowed.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Apparently, fixing that problem by increasing legal immigration, as opposed to looking the other way on illegal immigration, was never seriously considered by Congress, until very recently. Instead, by winking at businesses that hired illegal immigrants, the Federal government sent a clear signal to those in other countries:&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can make it into our country, you'll have no trouble qualifying for employment.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;And so - it's no surprise - people have been coming at such high levels that our border control simply cannot stop them.&nbsp; Unless we reduce the incentive to come here illegally, increasing our Border Patrol will have little impact on the number of people who enter illegally. We will waste the money spent, jeopardize lives, and deceive the public with a false promise of security that Congress knows it can't deliver.</p><p>&quot;Second, we must increase lawful opportunity for overseas workers. Science, medicine, education, and modern industries today are all growing faster overseas than here in the U.S., reversing the century long advantage we've enjoyed. Baby boomers are starting to retire, America's birthrate continues to slow, and we don't have enough workers to pay for our retirement benefits. The economics are very simple: We need more workers than we have.</p><p>&quot;That means we must increase the number of visas for overseas manual workers, who help provide the essential muscle and elbow grease we need to keep our economy running.&nbsp; It also means we must increase the number of visas for immigrant engineers, doctors, scientists, and other professionally trained workers-the innovators of tomorrow's economy. And we must give all of them, as well as foreign students, the opportunity to earn permanent status, so they can put their knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit to use for our country.</p><p>&quot;Why shouldn't we reap the benefits of the skills foreign students have obtained here? If we don't allow them in, or we force them to go home, we will be sending the future of science-and the jobs of tomorrow-with them.</p><p>&quot;Recent studies put the lie to the old argument that immigrants take jobs away from native-born Americans and significantly depress wages.&nbsp; Quite the contrary - they are what make our economy work. In most cases, those here illegally are filling low-wage, low-skill jobs that Americans do not want.</p><p>&quot;Global economic forces are responsible for the declines in the real wages of unskilled workers and occur regardless of whether immigrants are present in a community. Moreover, the total economic effect of any slight wage decline produced by immigration is more than offset by substantial increases in productivity.</p><p>&quot;To keep people and businesses investing in America, we need to ensure that we have workers for all types of jobs.</p><p>&quot;Third, we must reduce illegal access to our borders, which, as I've said, is a matter of urgent national security. As President Bush recognizes, in some areas, particularly in border towns, additional fencing may be required; in open desert areas, a virtual wall - created through sensors and cameras - will be far more effective.</p><p>&quot;However, even after we double the number of border agents, they will remain overwhelmed by the flood of people attempting to enter illegally. Only by embracing the first two principles - reducing incentives and increasing lawful opportunity - will border security become a manageable task.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Members of the House of Representatives want to control the borders.&nbsp; So do all of us here.&nbsp; But believing that increasing border patrols alone will achieve that goal is either na&iuml;ve and short-sighted, or cynical and duplicitous. No wall or army can stop hundreds of thousands of people each year.</p><p>&quot;Fourth, and finally, we need to get real about the people who are now living in this country illegally - in many cases raising families and paying taxes. The idea of deporting these 11 or 12 million people - about as many as live in the entire state of Pennsylvania - is pure fantasy. Even if we wanted to, it would be physically impossible to carry out. If we attempted it - and it would be perhaps the largest round-up and deportation in world history - the social and economic consequences would be devastating.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Let me ask you: Would we really want to spend billions of dollars on a round-up and deportation program that would split families in two - only to have these very same people and millions more, illegally enter our country again?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; America is better than that - and smarter than that.</p><p>&quot;That's why I do not believe that the American people will support the short-sighted approach to this issue taken by the House, which would make felons of illegal immigrants.</p><p>&quot;The Senate's tiered-approach, however, is flawed, too.&nbsp; Requiring some people to 'report to deport' through guest worker programs - while leaving their spouses, children, and mortgages behind - is no less na&iuml;ve than thinking we can deport 12 million people. What incentive would people have to show up?</p><p>&quot;In fact, this approach would just create an enormous incentive for fraud, and there can be little doubt that the black market for false documentation would remain strong and real enforcement impossible. If we're going to create a market for deceit, why not have Uncle Sam sell the fake papers, so we can at least get paid for it? It would be absurd, of course, but no less so than expecting people to line up for deportation.</p><p>&quot;There is only one practical solution, and it is a solution that respects the history of our nation: Offer those already here the opportunity to earn permanent status and keep their families together.</p><p>&quot;For decades, the Federal government has tacitly welcomed them into the workforce, collected their income and Social Security taxes, which about two-thirds of undocumented workers pay, and benefited immeasurably from their contributions to our country.</p><p>&quot;Now, instead of pointing fingers about the past, let's accept the present for what it is by bringing people out of the shadows, and focus on the future by casting those shadows aside, permanently.</p><p>&quot;As the debate continues between the House and Senate, I urge members of Congress to move past the superficial debate over the definition of 'amnesty.' Buzz words and polls should not dictate national policies.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We need Congress to lead from the front, not the back, and that means adopting a solution that is enforceable, sustainable, and compassionate - and that enables the American economy to thrive in the 21st century.&nbsp; Perhaps now more than ever before, it's time to vote for our future - and not pander to parochial fears.</p><p>&quot;Only by embracing all four of the principles I've outlined today can we achieve those goals.&nbsp; If one principle is abandoned, we will be no better off than we were after passage of the 1986 law. A successful solution to our border problems cannot rest on a wall alone; it must be built on a foundation strong enough to support it, and to support our continued economic growth and prosperity.</p><p>&quot;Before I close, there is one more critically important issue I'd like to raise about our policies towards those who are here illegally.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Members of the House of Representatives have recently attached an amendment to the Appropriations bills that would deny all federal homeland security and Department of Justice funding to any city or state deemed in violation of a 1996 federal law.&nbsp; That law prohibits restrictions on any local or state employee from contacting the federal government about someone's immigration status.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;New York City cooperates fully with the Federal government when an illegal immigrant commits a criminal act. But our City's social-services, health, and education policies are not designed to facilitate the deportation of otherwise law-abiding residents. Our general policy in this area protects the confidentiality of law-abiding immigrants, regardless of their status, when they report a crime, or visit a hospital, or send their children to school.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Without these protections, all our residents would be less safe and more likely to be at-risk for disease.&nbsp; Do we really want people who could have information about criminals - including potential terrorists - to be afraid to go the police? Do we really want people with contagious diseases not to seek medical treatment?&nbsp; Do we really want people not to get vaccinated against communicable diseases?</p><p>&quot;Our policy is carefully crafted to comply with the 1996 law, but some members of Congress don't like it.&nbsp; They have asked the Department of Justice to review all local and state policies concerning this issue.</p><p>&quot;We believe the review will validate our approach, but whatever the findings, let me be clear: the way to deal with this issue is not - not - by reducing the safety and security of our nation. There is already much too much politics in homeland security funding, which is one reason why New York City has consistently been short-changed of the money we need to protect our City. But this would really take the cake.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;If Congress attempts to cut off all of our homeland security funding, not to mention DOJ funding for many other essential programs, I promise you will have one heck of a battle on your hands. We are not going to let Congress cut-and-run from New York City - nor can our nation afford it.</p><p>&quot;New York remains the country's top terror target, and if Congress passes this amendment, no one will cheer louder than al-Qaeda.</p><p>&quot;Let me close by thanking you, along with President Bush, for taking up the issue of immigration reform.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;I urge the members of this Committee, and all members of Congress, to reject the false promise of easy answers, and to have the courage to do everything necessary - and that means standing up to both businesses and those with nativist impulses - to ensure our national security and prosperity.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Thank you and I would be happy to answer your questions.&quot;</p></span>

People around the globe love denim. It has become symbolic of a casual lifestyle for everyone. Denim is affordable, very comfortable and durable, and offers variety of styles and color. Lifestyle trends with casual dressing have always been beneficial to this industry. Demographics have played a major role and are really in denim's favor. People have grown up in denim, and we now see a younger group that is totally embedded in this form of clothing. Baby boomers love their denim. In fact, when consumers were asked which they prefer to wear, 67% of the people surveyed chose denim jeans over casual slacks. 85% reported they definitely see other types of jeans in their future. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><div style="font-size: xx-small; float: left; text-align: center" align="left"><table cellspacing="8" cellpadding="0" width="130" border="0"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><table bordercolor="#cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="130" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" width="130" border="0"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#e5e5ef"><div align="center"><strong>Highlighted Links</strong> </div></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.marketwire.com/mw/frame_multimedia?prid=141619&amp;attachid=291468" target="_blank">Lyric Jeans, Inc.</a><br /><a href="http://www.marketwire.com/mw/frame_multimedia?prid=141619&amp;attachid=291467" target="_blank">MacReport.Net</a><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Lyric Jeans, Inc. has developed a comprehensive business plan to accelerate product research and development. Additionally, the company intends to make investors aware of its message, products and services through an aggressive growth strategy that should enable Lyric Jeans to become a leading producer of high-end designer jeans. The average American now owns more than 7 pairs of jeans, up slightly from a few years ago. This trend shows no slowing down and remains as much a part of Americana as apple pie. Pop culture -- and the intersection of fashion with celebrity -- has certainly boosted the recognition of blue jean brand names. Many Wall Street analysts are claiming that denim could cure the apparel sectors ills. We feel they could be right on the mark. Typically, the back-to-school season is heavy on denim. Again the NPD Group reports that late-summer denim sales have averaged $3.4 billion over the past 5 years, or about 30% of annual sales. With this exciting new concept that Lyric Jeans is focused on, a solid jump in sales could dramatically boost the stock price. Consumer spending patterns are suggesting a second-half rebound fueled by a stronger economy. </p><p>Lyric Jeans looks to be a win-win situation for all involved. Interestingly, song writers receive a royalty for every pair of jeans sold which is innovative in itself. This allows them to promote their music, in turn selling more jeans and increasing shareholder value. One reason this could work so well is because no one else is doing it, and the denim market is always ripe for change. We think it offers a lot of opportunity. </p><p>ANALYST -- Officers of Market Advisors, Inc. have been in business since 1983 and have provided stock market research for their clients since 1985.

                              <strong><h5>Free Twizzlers(TM) Ice Cream for All Customers on July 22 at Treateries Nationwide </h5></strong><p><!--BSHSTARTBODY-->In honor of National Ice Cream Month and spokescow Maggie's birthday, MaggieMoo's International and The Hershey Company are celebrating with the launch of Twizzlers&trade; strawberry licorice ice cream, now available at MaggieMoo's Treateries. Kids of all ages will receive complimentary two-ounce scoops of the new flavor on Saturday, July 22, Maggie's official birthday, at the more than 190 Treateries nationwide. </p><p>&quot;MaggieMoo's nailed the Twizzlers&trade; flavor,&quot; said Howard Sherr, Director, Refreshment Brands, The Hershey Company, maker of Twizzlers&trade; candy. &quot;We are impressed with the exact flavor match, and think Twizzlers&trade; fans will enjoy the ice cream version.&quot; </p><p>Along with National Ice Cream Month and the launch of Twizzlers&trade; ice cream, MaggieMoo's also is celebrating the birthday of its beloved spokescow Maggie. Maggie, a seven-foot-tall cow with long curly eyelashes, pearls and a bright pink dress, is the face of the super-premium ice cream brand. She has been bringing smiles to children's faces by serving up her ice cream and participating in community activities across the country, for many years -- Maggie says a girl never tells her age. </p><p>In honor of Maggie's birthday, MaggieMoo's will be holding a national birthday party on July 22. Treateries will be decked out with birthday decorations and Maggie will be giving away free two-ounce scoops of Twizzlers&trade; ice cream as party favors. Maggie also will be packing the freezers with Twizzlers&trade; ice cream cakes, for those who want to take the party home with them, and offering coupons online for one dollar off the Twizzlers&trade; Tree House Fresh Escape. Customers can visit <a href="http://www.maggiemoos.com/" target="_blank">www.maggiemoos.com</a> to print the coupon, valid at all MaggieMoo's through July 31. </p><p>&quot;What better time than National Ice Cream Month and Maggie's birthday to introduce our new Twizzlers&trade; ice cream,&quot; said Jon Jameson, MaggieMoo's CEO. &quot;Our flavor specialists have successfully taken one of America's favorite licorice candies and made it into a delicious ice cream version.&quot; </p><p>When former President Ronald Ragan declared July as National Ice Cream Month, he most likely had no idea that more than 20 years later, ice cream fans would be indulging in flavors like Twizzlers&trade; candy. Today, ice cream companies are continually developing new and imaginative flavors. Most recently, there has been a trend in replicating ice cream flavors after popular drinks, desserts and candies, and MaggieMoo's is leading the way. </p><p>MaggieMoo's currently operates more than 190 Treateries across the nation. Each location features a menu of freshly made premium ice creams, mix-ins, smoothies, sorbets, ice cream cupcakes and custom ice cream cakes. </p><p>For further information on MaggieMoo's and its products, log onto <a href="http://www.maggiemoos.com/" target="_blank">www.maggiemoos.com</a>. </p><p>About MaggieMoo's Ice Cream and Treatery </p><p>Based in Columbia, Md., MaggieMoo's currently operates more than 190 Treateries across the nation.

Similar to reports made by the general work force, finances have played a significant role while hiring expectations have not shifted significantly.<br /></p><p>Employees at Large Companies More Optimistic<br /></p><p>While confidence among most demographics held steady or fell in June, workers at companies with more than 500 employees were significantly more optimistic this month than in May. Improved perceptions of personal finances, heightened job security and increased job satisfaction all contributed to the rise in confidence for this group.<br /></p><p>&quot;Larger organizations are less likely to be affected by the current softening in the economy,&quot; said Steve Wolfe, executive vice president, Hudson, North America. &quot;These employers can leverage their resources to financially help their employees by offering perks such as higher mileage reimbursement, flexible work arrangements and carpools.&quot;<br /></p><p>Mid-Year Review<br /></p><p>After a cautious start to the year, worker confidence was elevated in February, March and April as record high numbers of employees forecast that their companies would be hiring. However, financial strains have dampened optimism in the last couple months and the number of workers expecting their organization to hire has leveled off. &quot;While the market is a bit sluggish due to seasonal factors at the moment, employers will most likely continue hiring at a modest pace for the remainder of the year,&quot; said Wolfe. &quot;However, whether or not hiring can bolster the impact of rising interest rates and elevated gas prices is to be seen.&quot;<br /></p><pre>                          Hudson     Expected   Personal Finances  Concerned                         Employment    Hiring     Getting Worse       About                           Index                                     Job Loss   All Workers    June 2006              102.4         31%           43%             20%   All Workers    June 2005              103.0         31%           38%             21%   All Managers    June 2006              111.7         34%           39%             18%   All Managers    May 2006               113.9         23%           36%             17%   Workers at Companies   with 500+ Employees    June 2006              113.5         41%           39%             18%    *A more detailed data report is available at <a href="http://www.hudson-index.com/" target="_newbrowser">http://www.hudson-index.com/</a> .  </pre><p>Hudson, one of the world's leading professional staffing, outsourcing and talent management solutions providers, publishes the Hudson Employment Index, a monthly measure of U.S. worker confidence in the employment market. Results are not seasonally adjusted. Next month's Hudson Employment Index will be released on August 1.<br /></p><p>The Hudson Employment Index<br /></p><p>The Hudson Employment Index (Hudson-Index.com) is based on monthly telephone surveys with approximately 9,000 U.S. workers. The Index tracks aggregate employment trends regarding career opportunities, hiring intentions, job satisfaction and retention. The data is compiled each month by Rasmussen Reports, LLC, an independent research firm (<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/" target="_newbrowser">http://www.rasmussenreports.com/</a> ).<br /></p><p>Survey results are segmented by 11 cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Tampa, and Washington, D.C. The Index surveys five occupational sectors: accounting and finance, health care, information technology, manufacturing and legal. The Hudson Employment Index also measures employee confidence by age, gender, race and compensation.<br /></p><p>Data reported in this release is based on a national telephone survey of 9,291 working Americans during the month of May. The margin of sampling error for a survey based on this number of interviews is approximately +/-1 percent with a 95 percent level of confidence. The data is not seasonally adjusted. It will be reviewed at year-end to determine if seasonal adjustments are appropriate.

Lynne and his band <br />performed for the show's Summer Concert series, playing his recently <br />released singles &quot;Lipstick,&quot; and &quot;Do We Still&quot; from his new self-named <br />album on the Universal Recordings label.<br /><br />In honor of the nation's 230th birthday, Lynne also sang &quot;Red, White <br />and Blue,&quot; the ballad he wrote as the theme song for the &quot;America <br />Supports You&quot; program in 2004. Since then, he's performed the patriotic <br />tribute to the troops at the Pentagon, the Grand Ole Opry and at numerous <br />concerts and shows across the country.<br /><br />In the song, Lynne calls members of the armed forces &quot;modern-day <br />Minutemen and -women, like heroes from the past&quot; who reflect the values <br />America holds dear. He points out that America's military is a cross-section <br />of America, representing every corner of the country, every race, every <br />religion and every socioeconomic status.<br /><br />Despite their diverse backgrounds, Lynne sings, all are &quot;red, white and <br />blue,&quot; ready to respond to whatever mission their country calls upon <br />them to carry out.<br /><br />&quot;The military is a melting pot,&quot; he said. &quot;Regardless of their <br />background, they're all part of the same team, and that's why all of America <br />needs to support the troops.&quot;<br /><br />Lynne said he enlisted in the Army fresh out of high school - as a 6 <br />foot, 3 inch, skinny, out-of-shape kid with low self-esteem. He told <br />American Forces Press Service that his military experience helped fund his <br />musical training.<br /><br />After playing at venues across the country for more than 15 years, <br />Lynne got his break at age 39 when he signed with Universal Records.<br /><br />Throughout his career, Lynne said, he's never forgotten his military <br />roots or lost his appreciation for the sacrifices servicemembers make <br />every day.<br /><br />&quot;I have an amazing respect for those kids. They're all volunteers,&quot; he <br />said. &quot;Every single one of them felt a calling to serve our country. <br />And it's important that we stand behind them and make sure they know we <br />support them in that calling.&quot;<br /><br />During two recent visits to the Pentagon, the country singer met with <br />some of the troops wounded in the Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />&quot;I know how undeniable their will is and their sense of patriotism and <br />their camaraderie with their unit,&quot; Lynne said. &quot;You hear them say time <br />and time again, 'I wish I could go back with my guys.' But I never <br />cease to be absolutely floored by their uplifting attitude -- by the spirit <br />of what I can only describe as 'Americanism,' that just comes rising up <br />out of those young men and women.&quot;<br /><br />Lynne said he'll never forget the positive outlook of one young man he <br />met at the Pentagon. Sitting in a wheelchair wearing a prosthetic limb <br />from the knee down, the young veteran had a huge smile. He told the <br />country singer, &quot;It's not as bad as it looks,&quot; and said his new goal is to <br />join the Army's Golden Knights parachute team.<br /><br />&quot;No matter what you're going through in your life, you realize that <br />nothing that we have to struggle with is hard,&quot; Lynne said. &quot;What they <br />deal with is hard on a daily, minute-by-minute basis.&quot;<br /><br />People may shy away from talking to these young people, Lynne said, but <br />&quot;sticking our head in the sand&quot; is not the right thing to do. &quot;We have <br />to grasp the reality that these young men and women are paying, some <br />with their lives, some with their limbs, and some with their sense of <br />cognizance for the rest of their lives.&quot;<br /><br />One servicemember, who turned his head to show Lynne the large circular <br />scar on his shaved head, told him, &quot;At least I can walk and talk.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;We can never, ever forget the debt we owe these men and women,&quot; Lynne <br />concluded. &quot;They deserve our care.&quot;<br /><br />As he has for the past two years, Lynne will again show his support for <br />the troops during an annual motorcycle ride and benefit concert in <br />Minnesota honoring fallen servicemembers and their families. Sept. 8 to 10, <br />veterans, military family members and self-described patriots will <br />crisscross the state to personally thank the troops' families for their <br />sacrifice.

                              One of the first mainstream films to deal directly with the Holocaust, &ldquo;The Diary of Anne Frank&rdquo; (1959) will unspool for &ldquo;Monday Nights with Oscar&reg;&rdquo; audiences on Monday, July 17, at 6:30 p.m. (earlier time) at the Academy Theater at Lighthouse International in New York City. <p>Presented under the banner of the Academy&rsquo;s George Stevens Lecture, the event will feature a post-screening discussion with cast members Millie Perkins (Anne Frank), Diane Baker (Margot Frank) and Richard Beymer (Peter Van Daan). Robert Osborne, <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> columnist, host of Turner Classic Movies and official biographer of the Academy Awards&reg;, will moderate the program. </p><p>&ldquo;The Diary of Anne Frank&rdquo; was directed and produced by two-time Academy Award&reg; winner George Stevens, and it was adapted by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett from their 1955 Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name (which was in turn based on Anne Frank&rsquo;s diaries, published in <em>Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl</em>). The black-and-white film tells the story of 13-year-old Anne&rsquo;s life in hiding in Nazi-occupied Holland. </p><p>&ldquo;The Diary of Anne Frank&rdquo; was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won in three categories: Actress in a Supporting Role (Shelley Winters), Black-and-White Art Direction (Lyle R. Wheeler, George W. Davis; Set Decoration: Walter M. Scott, Stuart A. Reiss) and Black-and-White Cinematography (William C. Mellor). In addition to the nominations Stevens earned as the film&rsquo;s producer and director, Ed Wynn received a nomination in the Supporting Actor category, Alfred Newman was nominated for the film&rsquo;s music score, and Charles LeMaire and Mary Wills shared the nomination for Black-and-White Costume Design. </p><p>This New York screening of &ldquo;The Diary of Anne Frank&rdquo; will be the first big-screen presentation of a newly restored print of the original 170-minute version (the film was shortened by 20 minutes soon after its initial release). The print is courtesy of 20th Century-Fox. </p><p>The George Stevens Lecture was established in 1982 in honor of the legendary producer-director whose films are best remembered for combining social conscience with artistic excellence. Stevens received nine Academy Award nominations, won directing Oscars for &ldquo;A Place in the Sun&rdquo; and &ldquo;Giant,&rdquo; and was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1953. He was a longtime member of the Academy&rsquo;s Board of Governors and served as the organization&rsquo;s 14th president. Stevens died in 1975. </p><p>&ldquo;Monday Nights with Oscar&rdquo; is a monthly series showcasing high-quality prints of films that have been nominated for or won Academy Awards. </p><p>The Academy Theater at Lighthouse International is located at 111 East 59th Street in New York City. Tickets for the screening are $5 for the general public and $3 for Academy members and students with a valid ID. Tickets may be reserved by calling 1-888-778-7575. Depending on availability, tickets may be purchased in person the night of the screening. Doors open at 6 p.m.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"># # #</p><p class="footer">&copy;A.M.P.A.S.&reg;<br /></p>

The group will be the only new voting members invited to join the organization in 2006. </p><p>&ldquo;Two years ago the Academy decided to slow membership growth, and to become even more selective in choosing members,&rdquo; said Academy President Sid Ganis. &ldquo;Instead of inviting every proposed person who has achieved the minimum qualifications for his or her branch, the membership committees are selecting the most exceptionally qualified names from those lists.&rdquo;</p><p>Procedures instituted two years ago allow the organization to fill vacancies resulting from death and transitions to retired (non-voting) status and grow by a maximum of 30 new members annually. </p><p>Candidates for Academy membership are considered by committees made up of prominent representatives of each of the organization&rsquo;s 14 branches &mdash; art directors, executives, film editors, etc. Candidates can either be proposed by the committees or by two current members of their branch. In addition, individuals nominated for Academy Awards&reg;, if not already members of the organization, are considered by the appropriate committees, though not necessarily invited to membership. This year, 39 of the invitees were 2005 nominees and eight won Oscars&reg;. </p><p>Though the great majority of AMPAS members are based in the U.S., membership is open to qualified filmmakers around the world. The Academy roster currently includes theatrical motion picture makers from 36 countries.</p><p>New members will be welcomed into the organization at an invitation-only reception on Wednesday, September 20, at the Academy&rsquo;s Fairbanks Center for Motion Picture Study in Beverly Hills. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 240px"

Within the Church of Jerusalem, he added, the Apostle &quot;occupied an important position. ... In fact, Paul numbers him among those he called the 'pillars' of that community.&quot; Before the Sanhedrin, John affirmed that &quot;'we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.' This frankness in confessing his faith is an example ... for us all to be ready to declare decisively our unshakeable adherence to Christ, putting our faith before all calculation or human interest.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;According to tradition, John is the 'beloved disciple' who rested his head on the Master's chest during the Last Supper; he was at the foot of the Cross together with Jesus' Mother, and was a witness ... to the presence of the Risen One.&quot; Various scholars see in him &quot;the prototype of the disciple of Jesus&quot; Who wishes &quot;to make each of us a disciple living in personal friendship with Him. To do this, it is not enough to follow and listen to Him on the outside, it is necessary to live with Him and like Him. This is only possible in the context of a relationship of great familiarity, pervaded by the warmth of complete trust.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;In the apocryphal Acts of John,&quot; the Holy Father went on, &quot;the Apostle is presented ... as one who communicates the faith in meeting 'souls capable of hope and of being saved.' Everything is inspired by the paradoxical intent of making the invisible visible. Indeed, the Oriental Church calls him 'the Theologian,' in other words, one capable of speaking of divine things in accessible terms, revealing a mysterious access to God through adherence to Christ.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>In the East John, who according to tradition lived in Ephesus, &quot;enjoyed and continues to enjoy great veneration; in Byzantine iconography he is often depicted as a very old man in an attitude of intense contemplation, almost as if calling for silence.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;Without adequate prayer it is not possible to approach the supreme mystery of God and His revelation,&quot; said the Pope, and he concluded by quoting the words of the Patriarch Atenagoras: &quot;John is at the origin of our most exalted spirituality. Like him, the 'silent' experience the mysterious exchange of hearts; they invoke the presence of John and their hearts are aflame.&quot;</span></p><span><br /></span>&nbsp;<span>AG/JOHN/...<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>VIS 060705 (440)<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><strong><span>MAY HUMANITY EXPERIENCE THE POWER OF CHRIST'S BLOOD<br /></span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span>the greetings he addressed to participants in today's general audience, the Holy Father reminded Polish pilgrims that July is &quot;a month in which we traditionally venerate the Most Precious Blood of Christ.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>He went on: &quot;In the world innocent human blood is continually being spilt. The hearts of men are often full of hate rather than evangelical love, they often contain disdain and arrogance rather than care for mankind,.

                              <strong><p></p></strong><p>Potatoes (a new world food) were introduced to Europe by Spanish explorers in the 16th century. By the end of the century many countries had adopted this new vegetable and integrated it into their cuisines. Preparation methods and recipes were developed according to local culinary traditions. About <a href="http://www.cup.org/books/kiple/potatoes.htm"><u>potato history</u></a>. </p><p>Arnold Shircliffe, primary chef of Chicago's legendary Edgewater Beach Hotel, traced the origin of the potato salad to the 16th century. These are his notes:<br />&quot;Early potato salad: John Gerrard in 1597 writes about potatoes and their virtues and said that &quot;they are sometimes boiled and sopped in wine, by others boiled with prunes, and likewise others dress them (after roasting them in the ashes) in oil, vinegar and salt, every man according to his own taste. However they be dressed, they comfort, nourish and strengthen the body.&quot; This is one of the first potato salads mentioned in any book.&quot; <br />---<em>Edgewater Beach Hotel Salad Book</em>, Arnold Shircliffe [Hotel Monthly Press:Evanston IL] 1928 (p. 231) </p><p>Potato salad-type recipes were introduced to America by European settlers, who again adapted traditional foods to local ingredients. This accounts for regional potato salad variations in the United States. Potato salad, as we know it today, became popular in the second half of the 19th century. Cold potato salads evolved from British and French recipes. Warm potato salads followed the German preference for hot vinegar and bacon dressings served over vegetables. </p><p>Print evidence confirms recipes for potato salads were often included in 19th century American cooking texts. These recipes had many different names. <em>The Cassells Dictionary of Cookery</em> [London:1875?] contains three recipes for potato salad, one without notes [presumably British or American], a French recipe and a German recipe.The French recipe is very similar to the first and is also served cold. The German recipe required bacon. Early cold potato salad recipes often called for &quot;French dressing&quot; (Our notes on French dressing <a href="http://montebubbles.net/blog-mt/foodfaq1.html%20/%20frenchdressing"><u>here</u></a> ). Some recipes specifically indicate this is an economy dish, &quot;a good way to dispose of leftover potatoes.&quot; During the 1940s mayonnaise began to supplant French dressing as the congealer of choice. It is interesting to note that during both World Wars recipes for German-style potato salad did not bear that country's moniker. They were simply listed as &quot;hot potato salad.&quot; </p><strong><p>This is what the food writers have to say: </p></strong> <p>&quot;Potato salad. A cold or hot side dish made with potatoes, mayonnaise, and seasonings. It became very popular in the second half of the nineteenth century and is a staple of both home and food-store kitchens. Hot potato salad, usually made with bacon, onion, and vinegar dressing, was associated with German immigrants and therefore often called &quot;German potato salad.&quot;<br />---<em>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</em>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 253) </p><p>&quot;There seems to be no dogma concerning the origins of potato salad, but Germany is a good place to begin. As a country with lots of potatoes and lots of recipes for potatoes, Germany almost certainly was among the first to look at cooked small new potatoes or cut chunks of larger spuds and imagine them blanketed with dressing. The dressing they came up with was a classic. Kin to the heated dressing used to wilt spinach salad, this one thrilled German taste buds, raised as they were on sauerkraut and sauerbraten with vinegar bite. Some versions featured a little coarse mustard, others cut the sour with a little sugar, and most added bacon and even its flavorful drippings. By the time the notion of potato salad reached France, vinegar wasn't quite good enough. The French demanded full-scale vinaigrette, and it was no sweat to satisfy their demands. Whenever you see something called &quot;French potato salad,&quot; it's a safe bet you're in for potatoes (and probably other vegetables, too) in a light vinaigrette, with Dijon mustard and sweet tarragon. </p><p>When potato salad caught on in the United States, in the second half of the 19th century, it was probably by way of German immigrants. To this day, most people who know how to cook, or at least know how to eat, understand that &quot;German potato salad&quot; will be served warm, will feature no mayonnaise, and will be pleasantly tart with vinegar.The American idea of making potato salad with mayonnaise has no recorded history - but then again, neither does the idea of mayonnaise itself. Clearly a sauce created in France using egg yolks, oil and either lemon juice or vinegar, little is clear after that. Virtually every French bible of cuisine explains the name differently, ranging from a link to &quot;Magon,&quot; the Carthaginian general who helped his brother Hannibal battle the Romans,&quot; to a possible misspelling of &quot;Bayonnaise,&quot; hailing from the town of Bayonne in France - and later, less romantically, New Jersey. </p><p>However it got the name, mayonnaise became the favored dressing for American potato salad for more &quot;There seems to be no dogma concerning the origins of potato salad, but Germany is a good place to begin.

However it got the name, mayonnaise became the favored dressing for American potato salad for more than a century. Its sweet, creamy mouthfeel served up just the right delight when wrapped around solid, dependable American potatoes.&quot;<br />---&quot;A world of potato salads; Labor Day tradition gets global makeover,&quot; John DeMers, <em>The Houston Chronicle</em>, August 29, 2001 (Food: p. 1) </p><p>&quot;Despite its popularity in this country, potato salad is not an all-American creation. Potato salad is said to be of Teutonic origin, prepared when boiled potatoes were tossed with oil, vinegar and seasonings, a dish known now as German potato salad. The French, Norwegians, Swedes, Russians and Italians all have their own versions. Germans make a marvelous warm potato salad to which they add tiny bits of fresh tomato and red and green bell peppers, then toss the whole concoction with a warm bacon and onion dressing. The Greeks also prefer warm potato salad, with garlic, olive oil and lemon. Italian potato salad is apt to have ample amounts of fresh parsley, often chunks of salami and is dressed with an olive oil and vinegar dressing. American potato salad is heavier and heartier than European versions. Some people like lots of additions such as onion, sweet pickles, celery, hard-cooked eggs, pimento, chives, olives and parsley.&quot;<br />---&quot;Potato salad revisited,&quot; <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>, August 28, 1989 (Food p. 1) </p><strong><p>Sample recipes:</p><p>[1633] <a href="http://members.aol.com/renfrowcm/gerardp3.html%20/%20Potato"><strong><u>Potato</u></strong></a><br />---<em>Herball or General Historie of Plants</em>, John Gerard [London] </p><strong><p>[1863] &quot;The same [potatoes], in salad<br />Cook them [potatoes] without water in an oven, or hot cinders, if handy; then peel and cut them in thin slices; place them in a salad dish, season with chopped parsley, sweet oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, and serve.

                              <strong><p></p></strong><p>Food historians tell us the history of ice cream begins with ancient flavored ices. The Chinese are generally credited for creating the first ice creams, possibly as early as 3000 BC. Marco Polo is popularly cited for introducing these tasty concoctions to Italy. This claim (as well as his introducing <a href="http://montebubbles.net/blog-mt/foodfaq2.html%20/%20pasta"><u>pasta</u></a> to Italy) are questionable. The ice creams we enjoy today are said to have been invented in Italy during the 17th century. They spread northward through Europe via France. &quot;French-style&quot; ice cream and its American counterpart, &quot;Philadelphia-style,&quot; are egg-yolk enriched products made with the finest ingredients. The egg yolk/custard base creates a richer flavor and creamier texture. Vanilla is the most popular flavor of this genre. Food historians tell us this type of ice cream originated in the 17th century and proliferated in the early 18th. </p><p>&quot;...the Chinese may be credited with inventing a device to make sorbets and ice cream. They poured a mixture of snow and saltpetre over the exteriors of containers filled with syrup, for, in the same way as salt raises the boiling-point of water, it lowers the freezing-point to below zero. It is said that Marco Polo observed the practice and brought it home to Italy, traditionally a country that specializes in making ices. But all manner of things are said of Marco Polo....Francois I's daughter-in-law, Catherine de Medici, brought the fashion for sorbets to France. It soon spread from privileged tables to the middle classes when coffee houses became popular in the eighteenth century, and the ingenious Italian Procope made ice cream one of his cafe's specialties...At the end of the eighteenth century ice cream was made at home, in those households that owned an ice-cream maker, and Menon gives some recipes which are still very good.&quot;<br />---<em>History of Food</em>, Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, translated by Anthea Bell [Barnes &amp; Noble Books:New York] 1992 (p. 749-50) </p><p>&quot;Ice cream is reputed to have been made in China as long ago as 3000 BC, but it did not arrive in Europe (via Italy) until the thirteenth century, and Britain had to wait until the late seventeenth century to enjoy it (hitherto, iced desserts had been only of the sorbet variety)... by the time Hannah Glasse and Elizabeth Raffald were giving recipes for it in the mid-eighteenth century, it was evidently well established. At first, ice cream was simply as its name suggests: cream, perhaps sweetened, set in a pot nestling in ice to cool it down. But before long recipes became more sophisticated, and the technique of periodic stirring to prevent the formation of ice crystals was introduced, and ice cream was set on a career of unbroken popularity. As early as 1821 we find mention of &quot;ice-cream gardens' in New York....Since introducing ice cream to Europe in the Middle Ages, Italy has never relinquished its lead in theis field, and over the centuries the manufacture of ice cream has in many countries been the province of Italian emigres.&quot;<br />---<em>An A to Z of Food and Drink</em>, John Ayto [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 167) </p><p>&quot;Italians were the undisputed master in developing methods of chilling a freezing drinks...The creation of sorbet resulted from experiments in chilling drinks, and it too became a matter of myth. Supposedly, sorbet was also brought to France by Catherine de'Medici...There is no documentary evidence to support this hypothesis, however and we cannot prove that the art of sorbet making was already practiced in Italy in the middle of the sixteenth century...Latini's... <em>Treatise on Various Kinds of Sorbets, or Water Ices</em>...composed between 1692 and 1694...contains the first written recipes on how to mix sugar, salt, snow, and lemon juice, strawberrries, sour cherries, and other fruit, as well as chocolate, cinnamon water, and different flavorings. There is also a description of a &quot;milk sorbet that is first cooked,&quot; which we could regard as the birth certificate of ice cream. De'sorbetti, the first book entirely dedicated to the art of making frozen confections, was published in Naples in 1775. Its author, Filippo Baldini, discusses different types of sorbets...A separate chapter deals with &quot;milky sorbets,&quot; meaning ice creams, whose medical properties are vigorouly proclaimed.&quot;<br />---<em>Italian Cuisine: A Cultural History</em>, Alberto Capatti &amp; Massimo Montanari [Columbia University Press:New York] 1999 (p. 110-1) </p><p>&quot;The first ice creams, in the sense of an iced and flavoured confection made from full milk or cream, are thought to have been made in Italy and then in France in the 17th century, and to have been diffused from the French court to other European countries...The first recorded English use of the term ice cream (also given as iced cream) was by Ashmore (1672), recording among dishes served at the Feast of St. George at Windsor in May 1671 One Plate of Ice Cream'. The first published English recipe was by Mrs. Mary Eales (1718)...Mrs. Eales was a pioneer with few followers; ice cream recipes remained something of a rarity in English-language cookery books...As for America, Stallings observes that ice cream is recorded to have been served as early as 1744 (by the lady of Governor Blandon of Maryland, nee Barbara Jannsen, daughter of Lord Baltimore), but it does not appear to have been generally adopted until much later in the century. Although its adoption then owed much to French contacts in the period following the American Revolution, Americans shared 18th century England's tastes and the English preference for ice creams over water ices, and proceeded enthusiastically to make ice cream a national dish.&quot;<br />---<em>Oxford Companion to Food</em>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 392-3)<br />NOTE: These passages illustrate the conflicting data cited by food historians regarding the &quot;first&quot; mention of the phrase ice cream'. </p><strong><p>Mrs. Glasse's recipe, 1747:<br />&quot;To make ice cream.

Most food historians generally agree this confection originated in the 19th century. None of them are willing to commit with regards to &quot;absolute&quot; credit. Why? There are (at least) four popular stories regarding the &quot;invention/evolution&quot; of this dessert: </p><p>Thomas Jefferson<br />---served minister Manasseh Cutler a puddinglike dish that included &quot;ice cream very good, crust wholly dried, crumbled into thin flakes. [1802] </p><p>Chinese Chef <br />---unnamed, in Paris, no references made to his professional training or this being a Chinese dish. Pastry shell is used. </p><p>Benjamin Thompson <br />---aka Count Rumford, in Monaco, claim to fame is discovering meringue doesn't melt </p><p>Charles Ranhofer<br />---Delmonico's most famous chef, New York City, said to have served this to mark the occasion of Seward's Alaska purchase. </p><p>Culinary evidence confirms the concept of this recipe (cream and cake, without the ice or heat) dates to the Renaissance. Fancy molded bombes combining frozen cream and cake/biscuits were perfected in 18th-19th century Europe. Desserts approximating &quot;Baked Alaska&quot; began to appear in the middle of the 19th century. The name, however, belongs to the early years of the 20th. Today? We have Mexican <a href="http://montebubbles.net/%20friedicecream"><u>fried ice cream served with cornflake crusts</u></a> and Japanese ice cream tempura.</p><u><p><a href="http://montebubbles.net/%20icecream"><u>About ice cream</u></a> <a href="http://montebubbles.net/blog-mt/foodpies.html%20/%20lemon"><u>About meringue</u></a> <a href="http://montebubbles.net/%20icecreamcake"><u>About ice cream cake &amp; bombes</u></a> </p></u>   <p>&quot;Baked Alaska. A dessert made of sponge cake covered with ice cream in a meringue that is browned in the oven, but the ice cream remains frozen...The idea of baking ice cream in some kind of crust so as to create a hot-cold blend of textures occurred to Thomas Jefferson, who in 1802 served minister Manasseh Cutler a puddinglike dish that included &quot;ice cream very good, crust wholly dried, crumbled into thin flakes,&quot; And a report in the French journal Liberte for June 1866 indicates that the master cook of the Chinese mission in Paris imparted a technique for baking pastry over ice cream to the French chef Balzac of the Grand Hotel. But baked Alaska as we know it today may be traced to the experiments in heating and cooking conducted by Benjamin Thompson (1753-1814), born in Woburn Massachusetts, who became a celebrated scientist both at home and in England, where he was awarded the title of Count Rumford for his work...His studies of the resistance of egg whites to heat resulted in the browned topping that eventually became the crown for what came to be called &quot;Baked Alaska.&quot; Patricia M. Tice in Ice Cream for All (1990) asserted that Delmonico's chef, Charles Ranhofer, created &quot;Baked Alaska&quot; in 1869 to commemorate the purchase of Alaska by the United States, although in his own cookbook, the Epicurean (1893), Ranhofer calls the dish &quot;Alaska, Florida,&quot; The term &quot;Baked Alaska&quot; dates in print at least to 1905 and was used by Fannie Merritt Farmer in the 1909 edition of her cookbook.&quot;<br />---<em>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</em>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 16-7)<br />[NOTE: A Dictionary of Americanisms (c. 1951) provides exact cites for the 1802 and 1909 references. ] </p><p>&quot;A baked Alaska is a pudding consisting of a block of ice cream surrounded with meringue and then baked for a short time in a very hot oven. The notion of cooking an ice dessert within an insulating covering seems to have originated with the Chinese, who used pastry for the casing. It was apparently introduced to Europe in the mid-nineteenth century when a Chinese delegation visited Paris. The French took up the idea, substituting meringue for pastry (beaten egg whites are a poor conductor of heat) and naming the dish omelette norvegienne, Norwegian omelet' for its arctic appearance and cold centre. The English name baked Alaska originated in America around the turn of the twentieth centuury, the allusion being to Alaska's icy cold weather.&quot;<br />---<em>An A to Z of Food and Drink</em>, John Ayto [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 16) </p><p>&quot;The original recipe is said to have been perfected or rather brought back into fashion, at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo, by the chef Jean Giroix. An American doctor, and investor, honoured as Count Rumford, is credited with the invention of this dessert, which is based on the principle that beaten egg white is a poor conductor of heat. However, according to Baron Brisse, in his cookery column in La Liberte (6 June 1866), a chef to a Chinese delegation visting Paris introduced this dessert to the French. During the stay of the Chinese delegation in Paris, the chefs of the Celestial Empire exchanged courtesies and recipes with the chefs at the Grand Hotel. The French dessert chef was delighted at this opportunity: his Chinese colleague taught him the art of cooking vanilla and ginger ices in the oven. This is how the delicate operation was performed: very firm ice cream is enveloped in an extremely light pastry crust and baked in the oven. The crust insulated the interior and is cooked before the ice cream can melt. Gourmand can then enjoy the twofold pleasure of biting into a crisp crust and at the same time referencing the palate with the flavoured ice cream.&quot;<br />---<em>Larousse Gastronomique</em>, Completely Revised and Updated Edition [Clarkson Potter:New York] 2001 (p. 65) </p><p>&quot;Baked Norvegienne, or baked Alaska, was a favorite gourmet dish in the Fifties. It appealed on a number of levels: (1) it tasted good; (2) it was easy to make (at least so long as it was made quickly); (3) it looked as though it must be difficult; (4) with its simple meringue, ice cream, and cake base it was a safe dessert to serve to even the stodgiest guests; and (5) it was both festive and fancy. Everyone seems to agree that a dish something like baked Alaska appeared in France in the mid-1800s. Whether it was invented earlier by an American scientist named Benjamin Thompson (1753-1814) who was experimenting with the insulating properties of egg whites of by a Chinese chef in Paris who baked ice cream in an insulating pastry shell in the 1860s is debated. Personally I prefer John Mariani's explanation that Dr. Thompson's experiments resulted in a dessert called &quot;Alaska-Florida&quot; that was popular at the famous Delmonico's restaurant in New York on the 1800s. For all its French pretentions, baked Alaska has always seemed like an American dish. The French name omelette a al Norvegienne refers to the fact that the cake base is traditionally cut into an omelette shape. Presumably Norvegienne alludes to its chilly interior, although Francois Rysavy, President Eisenhower's chef, said that baked Alaska is a &quot;Scandinavian delicacy.&quot; There seems to be no evidence for his statement, however...The Chinese chef how may have invented baked Alaska (but probably didn't) baked his ice cream in pastry shells. That idea was also a popular one in the 1950s. Ice cream pies were very chic then, and baked Alaska ice cream pie was too soigne for words.&quot;<br />---<em>Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads</em>, Sylvia Lovegren [MacMillan:New York] 1995 (p. 200-1) </p><strong><p>RECIPES THROUGH TIME:&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&quot;<br /><strong>[1894] <br /></strong><a href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/display.cfm?TitleNo=39&amp;PageNum=425"><strong><u>&quot;Alaska, Florida&quot;</u></strong></a>, Charles Ranhofer </p></strong>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&quot;, Charles Ranhofer <strong><p>[1903]<br />&quot;4419.

In the 1920s, the &quot;egg cream,&quot; an eggless, creamless libation was invented in a New York soda fountain...The annals of time have obscured inventor and the rational and philosophical underpinnings of the drink's name.&quot;<br />---<em>New York Cook Book</em>, Molly O'Neill [Workman Publishing:New York] 1992 (p. 197) </p><p>&quot;Egg cream. A New York City soda-fountain confection made from chocolate syrup, milk, and seltzer. The simplicity of the egg cream is deceptive, for its flavor and texture depend entirely on the correct preparation. There is no egg in an egg cream, but if the ingredients are mixed properly, a foamy, egg-white-like head tops the drink. Nevertheless, as David Shulman pointed out in <em>American Speech</em> (1987), there was a confection, called an &quot;egg cream&quot; syrup listed in W.A. Bonham's <em>Modern Guide for Soda Dispensers</em> (1896) that was made with both eggs and cream, but no chocolate. This was probably not the egg cream that gained legendary fame in eastern cities. Also, Lettice Bryan in <em>The Kentucky Housewife</em> (1839) gives a recipe for an orange-flavored custard dessert called &quot;egg cream.&quot; There seems no basis to believe the legend the Yiddish actor Boris Thomashefsky brought the idea for the egg cream back from Paris after having tasted a drink called chocolate et creme. Indeed the unchallenged claim for the invention of the egg cream is that Louis Auster, a Jewish immigrant who came to the United States about 1890 and opened a candy store at Stanton and Avenue D. According to Auster's grandson...the egg cream was a matter of happenstance. &quot;My [grandfather] was fooling around, and he started mixing water and cocoa and sugar and so on, and somehow or other, eureka, he hit on something which seemed to be just perfect for him.&quot; Auster's egg creams became famous...and were based on a secret formula that has never been revealed...The chocolate syrup used was made in the rear of the store, and windows were blacked out for privacy. &quot;The name of the egg cream was really a misnomer, &quot; recalled Stanley Auster. &quot;People thought there was cream in it, and they would like to think there was egg in it becuase egg meant something that was really good and expensive. There was never any egg, and there never was any cream.&quot; Auster also insisted a glass, not a paper cup, and ice-cold milk were basic to the success of a good egg cream. After Louis Auster died...the recipe passed to his family, with the last batch of the secret syrup made up...around 1974. The first printed reference to the egg cream was in 1950. Without accesss to Auster's syrup, other soda fountains and candy stores made the drink with &quot;Fox's u-bet Chocolate Flavor Syrup,&quot; Created by Herman Fox some time before 1920 in Brooklyn, now considered the most widely accepted ingredient in the mix.&quot;<br />---<em>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</em>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 120) </p><p>&quot;Fox's U-Bet Chocolate Syrup is a classic. You absolutely cannot make an egg cream without [it]...The firm, founded sometime between 1910 and 1920...began in a Brownsville basement...The recipe for U-Bet remains the same: Brooklyn water, sugar, corn sweeteners, cocoa, and some &quot;secret things.&quot; The name &quot;U-Bet dates from the late 20s when Fox's grandfather got wildcatting fever and headed to Texas to drill for oil. &quot;You bet&quot; was a friendly term the oilmen used. His oil venture a failure, he returend to the old firm, changing Fox's Chocolate Syrup to Fox's U-Bet...Fox has fan letters form Mel Brooks, Don Rickles...You shouldn't have to ask, but there is no egg or cream in an egg cream.

Now pour this into a shaker, then turn in fine soda stream, then pour bakc and forth from your shaker to your glass two or three times. In pouring back and forth, do not overdo it as it will thin the drink. Pour into galss after mixing and sprinkle a little ground mace or nutmeg over the top. Most fountains now have the electric mixers but if you do not have one, you should use a heavy soda or mixing glass instead of the 10-ounce glass, then after adding cream, add a little crushed ice which will break the egg. Place shaker on top of glass and shake up and down until thoroughly mixed, then remove heavy soda glass and fill shaker with fine soda stream, then mix by pouring back and forth from a 10-ounce soda glass to shaker. Pour last in the glass and sprinkle top with ground mace or nutmeg. Egg drinks are profitable and a large trade on them can be created if care is exercised in their mixture.

Now pour this into a shaker, then turn in fine soda stream, then pour bakc and forth from your shaker to your glass two or three times. In pouring back and forth, do not overdo it as it will thin the drink. Pour into galss after mixing and sprinkle a little ground mace or nutmeg over the top. Most fountains now have the electric mixers but if you do not have one, you should use a heavy soda or mixing glass instead of the 10-ounce glass, then after adding cream, add a little crushed ice which will break the egg.

It presumably came from the cry with which the vendors hawked it, although what this originally was is not known (one suggestion put forward in the 1880s was Italian O che poco! 'Oh how little!'--a reference to price, presumably, rather than quantity--which is given some plausibility by the fact that many ice-cream sellers at that time were Italian).

These were called trifles. These fancy desserts were enjoyed by middle class and wealthy people. Food historians tell us ice cream, as we know it, was &quot;invented&quot; in the 17th century and proliferated in the 18th. These early recipes were generally based on the same creams used for trifles. The difference? Freezing technique. Victorians prided themselves on fancy ice cream &quot;bombes&quot; (ice cream molded into special shapes). A survey of old cookbooks confirms biscuits (Savoy, sponge) were sometimes used to line the mold that held the ice cream. Voila!

Historically, sorbets were the first iced desserts (ice creams did not appear until ith 18th century). The Chinese introduced them to the Persians and Arabs who introduced them to the Italians.

Since malted milk was also considered a tonic, the combined malted milk shake was a logical step and in the early 1900s people were asking for the new treat, often with ice cream, and before 1910 were using the shorter terms shake and malt (the longer word malted being somewhat more common in the Eastern states).

Recipes for the fancy molds (bombes) or bricks of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry (sometimes pistachio) were often included in 19th century European and American cook books. This was a function of technology (refrigeration advancements) and collective gastronomy (preference for complicated presentations). Why &quot;Neapolitan?&quot; The peoples of Napoli are credited for introducing their famous ice creams to the world in the 19th century.

This dessert was not served in tall, thin glassware as we know today. It was extracted from the mold (of similar shape) and served on decorated plates. </p><p>Layered, molded ice cream treats (with fruits, syrups &amp; liqueurs) were quite popular by the mid-19th century both in Europe and America. They were presented in many fabulous shapes much to the delight of diners of all ages. Parfait, as is currently known by Americans is a multi-layered ice cream treat presented in &quot;parfait&quot; glasses. These glasses are typically thin and tall. The parfait is usually made with rich vanilla ice cream accented with liqueur or other other syrup (chocolate, strawberry) . The most notable difference between an American parfait and the ever popular Ice Cream Sundae is the dish. The parfait is presented tall &amp; thin; the sundae is most often served in a wide-mouth glass that may or may not have a stem. The use of liqueur is generally relegated to the parfait. Did you know? Parfait is the French word for &quot;perfect.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Parfait. An iced dessert made with double (heavy) cream, which gives it smoothness, prevents it from melting too quickly and enables it to be cut into slices. Originally the parfait was a coffee-flavoured ice cream; today, the basic mixture is a flavoured custard-cream, a flavoured syrup mixed with egg yolks or a fruit puree, which is blended with whipped ccream and then frozen. There is a special parfait mould in the shape of a cylindar with one slightly rounded end...In Britain and the United States a parfait is also the name of a whipped dessert.&quot;<br />--<em>Larousse Gastonomique</em>, Completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York] 2001 (p. 840) </p><p>&quot;Parfait. A name properly used of a rich frozen dessert, similar to a bombe and often made in a bombe mold. A typical parfait is composed of two or several elements (a lining for the mould and a filling, which may itself be layered) and is flavoured with a liqueur, or with coffee, chocolate, praline, etc. In North America, the term has come to mean something different, namely a combination of fruit and ice cream, served in a tall narrow glass which exposes to view the various layers of the confection. This sort of parfait is not a frozen dessert. However, the frozen dessert version can be frozen in individual parfait glasses, rather than in a single mould, so there is a relationship between the two different things.&quot;<br />---<em>Oxford Companion to Food</em>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 575) </p><p>The oldest recipe we have with the name parfait is from a French cookbook dated 1869.

These ranged from hand-pushed carts to goat-pulled mini-wagons to bicycle-propelled carts to horsedrawn/electric trucks. Folks who make a living selling ice treats from carts were known as &quot;hokey pokey&quot; men. How long before these treats would melt? That would be determined by the quality of the cart and the temperature of the day. The history of the popsicle is a fascnating topic unto itself. Like the history of many popular frozen treats, it is full of conflicting claims and culinary folklore. While Frank Epperson is generally credited for &quot;inventing&quot; the popsicle (first called the Epsicle, after himself), there is ample evidence that frozen fruit treats and juice bars existed in the late 19th century. These treats were often hawked by people of Italian descent, who were versed in the fine art of granita. Even the Epperson story has many &quot;versions.&quot; The Epperson story sticks not because he was the first, but because he was the first to mass market this product. </p><p>About Frank Epperson's popsicle </p><p>&quot;The third member of the great novelty trimuvirate of the 1920s was born on a cold eureka-shouting morning in New Jersey in 1923. The inventor was Frank Epperson, who made lemonade from a specially prepared powder that he sold at an Oakland, California, amusement park. While visiting friends in New Jersey, he prepared a batch of special lemonade and inadvertantly left a glass of it on a windowsill with a spoon in it. The temperature went down below zero during the night and in the morning Epperson saw the glass. He picked it up by the spoon handle and ran hot water over the glass freeing the frozen mass. In his hand was the first Epsicle, later to be known as the Popsicle. Epperson saw immediately the potential of what he held in his hand and applied for a patent, which was granted in 1924. He was fortunate, because research conducted by <em>The Ice Cream Review</em> in 1925 revealed that a major ice cream company was experimenting with &quot;frozen suckers&quot; at the time of the windowsill incident, and as far back as 1872 two men doing business as Ross and Robbins sold a frozen-fruit confection on a stick, which they called the Hokey-Pokey.&quot;<br />---<em>Great American Ice Cream Book</em>, Paul Dickson [Atheneum:New York] 1972 (p. 83) </p><p>&quot;In 1905 an eleven-year-old boy named Frank Epperson, of Oakland, California, accientally left a mixing stick in a glass of juice on a windowsill while visiting friends in New Jersey. The juice froze with the stick in it, enabling the ice to be held in the hand and licked.In 1922 Epperson introduced this new &quot;icelollipop&quot; at a fireman's ball in Oakland, California, and called it an &quot;Epsicle,&quot; then later &quot;Popsicle.&quot; (Frozen &quot;juice bars&quot; had been known in the nineteenth century, including one called the &quot;Hokey Pokey,&quot; but none was marketed well until the Popsicle in 1923.)&quot;<br />---<em>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</em>, John F.

                              <strong><p></p></strong><p>Food historians tell us the history of ice cream begins with ancient flavored ices. The Chinese are generally credited for creating the first ice creams, possibly as early as 3000 BC. Marco Polo is popularly cited for introducing these tasty concoctions to Italy. This claim (as well as his introducing <a href="http://montebubbles.net/blog-mt/foodfaq2.html%20/%20pasta"><u>pasta</u></a> to Italy) are questionable. The ice creams we enjoy today are said to have been invented in Italy during the 17th century. They spread northward through Europe via France. &quot;French-style&quot; ice cream and its American counterpart, &quot;Philadelphia-style,&quot; are egg-yolk enriched products made with the finest ingredients. The egg yolk/custard base creates a richer flavor and creamier texture. Vanilla is the most popular flavor of this genre. Food historians tell us this type of ice cream originated in the 17th century and proliferated in the early 18th. </p><p>&quot;...the Chinese may be credited with inventing a device to make sorbets and ice cream. They poured a mixture of snow and saltpetre over the exteriors of containers filled with syrup, for, in the same way as salt raises the boiling-point of water, it lowers the freezing-point to below zero. It is said that Marco Polo observed the practice and brought it home to Italy, traditionally a country that specializes in making ices. But all manner of things are said of Marco Polo....Francois I's daughter-in-law, Catherine de Medici, brought the fashion for sorbets to France. It soon spread from privileged tables to the middle classes when coffee houses became popular in the eighteenth century, and the ingenious Italian Procope made ice cream one of his cafe's specialties...At the end of the eighteenth century ice cream was made at home, in those households that owned an ice-cream maker, and Menon gives some recipes which are still very good.&quot;<br />---<em>History of Food</em>, Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, translated by Anthea Bell [Barnes &amp; Noble Books:New York] 1992 (p. 749-50) </p><p>&quot;Ice cream is reputed to have been made in China as long ago as 3000 BC, but it did not arrive in Europe (via Italy) until the thirteenth century, and Britain had to wait until the late seventeenth century to enjoy it (hitherto, iced desserts had been only of the sorbet variety)... by the time Hannah Glasse and Elizabeth Raffald were giving recipes for it in the mid-eighteenth century, it was evidently well established. At first, ice cream was simply as its name suggests: cream, perhaps sweetened, set in a pot nestling in ice to cool it down. But before long recipes became more sophisticated, and the technique of periodic stirring to prevent the formation of ice crystals was introduced, and ice cream was set on a career of unbroken popularity. As early as 1821 we find mention of &quot;ice-cream gardens' in New York....Since introducing ice cream to Europe in the Middle Ages, Italy has never relinquished its lead in theis field, and over the centuries the manufacture of ice cream has in many countries been the province of Italian emigres.&quot;<br />---<em>An A to Z of Food and Drink</em>, John Ayto [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 167) </p><p>&quot;Italians were the undisputed master in developing methods of chilling a freezing drinks...The creation of sorbet resulted from experiments in chilling drinks, and it too became a matter of myth. Supposedly, sorbet was also brought to France by Catherine de'Medici...There is no documentary evidence to support this hypothesis, however and we cannot prove that the art of sorbet making was already practiced in Italy in the middle of the sixteenth century...Latini's... <em>Treatise on Various Kinds of Sorbets, or Water Ices</em>...composed between 1692 and 1694...contains the first written recipes on how to mix sugar, salt, snow, and lemon juice, strawberrries, sour cherries, and other fruit, as well as chocolate, cinnamon water, and different flavorings. There is also a description of a &quot;milk sorbet that is first cooked,&quot; which we could regard as the birth certificate of ice cream. De'sorbetti, the first book entirely dedicated to the art of making frozen confections, was published in Naples in 1775. Its author, Filippo Baldini, discusses different types of sorbets...A separate chapter deals with &quot;milky sorbets,&quot; meaning ice creams, whose medical properties are vigorouly proclaimed.&quot;<br />---<em>Italian Cuisine: A Cultural History</em>, Alberto Capatti &amp; Massimo Montanari [Columbia University Press:New York] 1999 (p. 110-1) </p><p>&quot;The first ice creams, in the sense of an iced and flavoured confection made from full milk or cream, are thought to have been made in Italy and then in France in the 17th century, and to have been diffused from the French court to other European countries...The first recorded English use of the term ice cream (also given as iced cream) was by Ashmore (1672), recording among dishes served at the Feast of St. George at Windsor in May 1671 One Plate of Ice Cream'. The first published English recipe was by Mrs. Mary Eales (1718)...Mrs. Eales was a pioneer with few followers; ice cream recipes remained something of a rarity in English-language cookery books...As for America, Stallings observes that ice cream is recorded to have been served as early as 1744 (by the lady of Governor Blandon of Maryland, nee Barbara Jannsen, daughter of Lord Baltimore), but it does not appear to have been generally adopted until much later in the century. Although its adoption then owed much to French contacts in the period following the American Revolution, Americans shared 18th century England's tastes and the English preference for ice creams over water ices, and proceeded enthusiastically to make ice cream a national dish.&quot;<br />---<em>Oxford Companion to Food</em>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 392-3)<br />NOTE: These passages illustrate the conflicting data cited by food historians regarding the &quot;first&quot; mention of the phrase ice cream'. </p><strong><p>Mrs. Glasse's recipe, 1747:<br />&quot;To make ice cream. Take two pewter basons, one larger than the other; the inward one must have a close cover, into which you are to put your cream, and mix it with raspberries, or whatver you like best, to give it a flavour and a colour. Sweeten it to you palate; then cover it close, and set it into the larger bason. Fill it with ice, and a handful of salt: let it stand in this ice three quarters of an hour, then uncover it, and stir the cream well together: cover it close again, and let is stand half an hour longer, after that turn it into your plate.

Most food historians generally agree this confection originated in the 19th century. None of them are willing to commit with regards to &quot;absolute&quot; credit. Why? There are (at least) four popular stories regarding the &quot;invention/evolution&quot; of this dessert: </p><p>Thomas Jefferson<br />---served minister Manasseh Cutler a puddinglike dish that included &quot;ice cream very good, crust wholly dried, crumbled into thin flakes. [1802] </p><p>Chinese Chef <br />---unnamed, in Paris, no references made to his professional training or this being a Chinese dish. Pastry shell is used. </p><p>Benjamin Thompson <br />---aka Count Rumford, in Monaco, claim to fame is discovering meringue doesn't melt </p><p>Charles Ranhofer<br />---Delmonico's most famous chef, New York City, said to have served this to mark the occasion of Seward's Alaska purchase. </p><p>Culinary evidence confirms the concept of this recipe (cream and cake, without the ice or heat) dates to the Renaissance. Fancy molded bombes combining frozen cream and cake/biscuits were perfected in 18th-19th century Europe. Desserts approximating &quot;Baked Alaska&quot; began to appear in the middle of the 19th century. The name, however, belongs to the early years of the 20th. Today? We have Mexican <a href="http://montebubbles.net/%20friedicecream"><u>fried ice cream served with cornflake crusts</u></a> and Japanese ice cream tempura.</p><u><p><a href="http://montebubbles.net/%20icecream"><u>About ice cream</u></a> <a href="http://montebubbles.net/blog-mt/foodpies.html%20/%20lemon"><u>About meringue</u></a> <a href="http://montebubbles.net/%20icecreamcake"><u>About ice cream cake &amp; bombes</u></a> </p></u>   <p>&quot;Baked Alaska. A dessert made of sponge cake covered with ice cream in a meringue that is browned in the oven, but the ice cream remains frozen...The idea of baking ice cream in some kind of crust so as to create a hot-cold blend of textures occurred to Thomas Jefferson, who in 1802 served minister Manasseh Cutler a puddinglike dish that included &quot;ice cream very good, crust wholly dried, crumbled into thin flakes,&quot; And a report in the French journal Liberte for June 1866 indicates that the master cook of the Chinese mission in Paris imparted a technique for baking pastry over ice cream to the French chef Balzac of the Grand Hotel. But baked Alaska as we know it today may be traced to the experiments in heating and cooking conducted by Benjamin Thompson (1753-1814), born in Woburn Massachusetts, who became a celebrated scientist both at home and in England, where he was awarded the title of Count Rumford for his work...His studies of the resistance of egg whites to heat resulted in the browned topping that eventually became the crown for what came to be called &quot;Baked Alaska.&quot; Patricia M. Tice in Ice Cream for All (1990) asserted that Delmonico's chef, Charles Ranhofer, created &quot;Baked Alaska&quot; in 1869 to commemorate the purchase of Alaska by the United States, although in his own cookbook, the Epicurean (1893), Ranhofer calls the dish &quot;Alaska, Florida,&quot; The term &quot;Baked Alaska&quot; dates in print at least to 1905 and was used by Fannie Merritt Farmer in the 1909 edition of her cookbook.&quot;<br />---<em>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</em>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 16-7)<br />[NOTE: A Dictionary of Americanisms (c. 1951) provides exact cites for the 1802 and 1909 references. ] </p><p>&quot;A baked Alaska is a pudding consisting of a block of ice cream surrounded with meringue and then baked for a short time in a very hot oven. The notion of cooking an ice dessert within an insulating covering seems to have originated with the Chinese, who used pastry for the casing. It was apparently introduced to Europe in the mid-nineteenth century when a Chinese delegation visited Paris. The French took up the idea, substituting meringue for pastry (beaten egg whites are a poor conductor of heat) and naming the dish omelette norvegienne, Norwegian omelet' for its arctic appearance and cold centre. The English name baked Alaska originated in America around the turn of the twentieth centuury, the allusion being to Alaska's icy cold weather.&quot;<br />---<em>An A to Z of Food and Drink</em>, John Ayto [Oxford Univeristy Press:Oxford] 2002 (p. 16) </p><p>&quot;The original recipe is said to have been perfected or rather brought back into fashion, at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo, by the chef Jean Giroix. An American doctor, and investor, honoured as Count Rumford, is credited with the invention of this dessert, which is based on the principle that beaten egg white is a poor conductor of heat. However, according to Baron Brisse, in his cookery column in La Liberte (6 June 1866), a chef to a Chinese delegation visting Paris introduced this dessert to the French. During the stay of the Chinese delegation in Paris, the chefs of the Celestial Empire exchanged courtesies and recipes with the chefs at the Grand Hotel. The French dessert chef was delighted at this opportunity: his Chinese colleague taught him the art of cooking vanilla and ginger ices in the oven. This is how the delicate operation was performed: very firm ice cream is enveloped in an extremely light pastry crust and baked in the oven. The crust insulated the interior and is cooked before the ice cream can melt. Gourmand can then enjoy the twofold pleasure of biting into a crisp crust and at the same time referencing the palate with the flavoured ice cream.&quot;<br />---<em>Larousse Gastronomique</em>, Completely Revised and Updated Edition [Clarkson Potter:New York] 2001 (p. 65) </p><p>&quot;Baked Norvegienne, or baked Alaska, was a favorite gourmet dish in the Fifties. It appealed on a number of levels: (1) it tasted good; (2) it was easy to make (at least so long as it was made quickly); (3) it looked as though it must be difficult; (4) with its simple meringue, ice cream, and cake base it was a safe dessert to serve to even the stodgiest guests; and (5) it was both festive and fancy. Everyone seems to agree that a dish something like baked Alaska appeared in France in the mid-1800s. Whether it was invented earlier by an American scientist named Benjamin Thompson (1753-1814) who was experimenting with the insulating properties of egg whites of by a Chinese chef in Paris who baked ice cream in an insulating pastry shell in the 1860s is debated. Personally I prefer John Mariani's explanation that Dr. Thompson's experiments resulted in a dessert called &quot;Alaska-Florida&quot; that was popular at the famous Delmonico's restaurant in New York on the 1800s. For all its French pretentions, baked Alaska has always seemed like an American dish. The French name omelette a al Norvegienne refers to the fact that the cake base is traditionally cut into an omelette shape. Presumably Norvegienne alludes to its chilly interior, although Francois Rysavy, President Eisenhower's chef, said that baked Alaska is a &quot;Scandinavian delicacy.&quot; There seems to be no evidence for his statement, however...The Chinese chef how may have invented baked Alaska (but probably didn't) baked his ice cream in pastry shells. That idea was also a popular one in the 1950s. Ice cream pies were very chic then, and baked Alaska ice cream pie was too soigne for words.&quot;<br />---<em>Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads</em>, Sylvia Lovegren [MacMillan:New York] 1995 (p. 200-1) </p><strong><p>RECIPES THROUGH TIME:&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&quot;<br /><strong>[1894] <br /></strong><a href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/display.cfm?TitleNo=39&amp;PageNum=425"><strong><u>&quot;Alaska, Florida&quot;</u></strong></a>, Charles Ranhofer </p></strong>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&quot;, Charles Ranhofer <strong><p>[1903]<br />&quot;4419.

The same holds true for many beloved foods we eat today, esp. those born of the soda fountain era. Culinary evidence confirms egg-based soda recipes with chocolate syrup did exist, under different names. They descended from early <a href="http://www.journalofantiques.com/Dec02/hearthdec02.htm"><u>egg nog</u></a> recipes. <a href="http://montebubbles.net/%20eggdrin"><u>&quot;Egg Drin&quot;</u></a>, a popular early 20th century soda fountain concoction, is strikingly similar to the classic egg cream. </p><p>&quot;By 1891, there were more soda fountins than bars in New York according to <em>On the Town in New York</em> by Michael and Ariane Batterberry. In the 1920s, the &quot;egg cream,&quot; an eggless, creamless libation was invented in a New York soda fountain...The annals of time have obscured inventor and the rational and philosophical underpinnings of the drink's name.&quot;<br />---<em>New York Cook Book</em>, Molly O'Neill [Workman Publishing:New York] 1992 (p. 197) </p><p>&quot;Egg cream. A New York City soda-fountain confection made from chocolate syrup, milk, and seltzer. The simplicity of the egg cream is deceptive, for its flavor and texture depend entirely on the correct preparation. There is no egg in an egg cream, but if the ingredients are mixed properly, a foamy, egg-white-like head tops the drink. Nevertheless, as David Shulman pointed out in <em>American Speech</em> (1987), there was a confection, called an &quot;egg cream&quot; syrup listed in W.A. Bonham's <em>Modern Guide for Soda Dispensers</em> (1896) that was made with both eggs and cream, but no chocolate. This was probably not the egg cream that gained legendary fame in eastern cities. Also, Lettice Bryan in <em>The Kentucky Housewife</em> (1839) gives a recipe for an orange-flavored custard dessert called &quot;egg cream.&quot; There seems no basis to believe the legend the Yiddish actor Boris Thomashefsky brought the idea for the egg cream back from Paris after having tasted a drink called chocolate et creme. Indeed the unchallenged claim for the invention of the egg cream is that Louis Auster, a Jewish immigrant who came to the United States about 1890 and opened a candy store at Stanton and Avenue D. According to Auster's grandson...the egg cream was a matter of happenstance. &quot;My [grandfather] was fooling around, and he started mixing water and cocoa and sugar and so on, and somehow or other, eureka, he hit on something which seemed to be just perfect for him.&quot; Auster's egg creams became famous...and were based on a secret formula that has never been revealed...The chocolate syrup used was made in the rear of the store, and windows were blacked out for privacy. &quot;The name of the egg cream was really a misnomer, &quot; recalled Stanley Auster. &quot;People thought there was cream in it, and they would like to think there was egg in it becuase egg meant something that was really good and expensive. There was never any egg, and there never was any cream.&quot; Auster also insisted a glass, not a paper cup, and ice-cold milk were basic to the success of a good egg cream. After Louis Auster died...the recipe passed to his family, with the last batch of the secret syrup made up...around 1974. The first printed reference to the egg cream was in 1950. Without accesss to Auster's syrup, other soda fountains and candy stores made the drink with &quot;Fox's u-bet Chocolate Flavor Syrup,&quot; Created by Herman Fox some time before 1920 in Brooklyn, now considered the most widely accepted ingredient in the mix.&quot;<br />---<em>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</em>, John F.

It presumably came from the cry with which the vendors hawked it, although what this originally was is not known (one suggestion put forward in the 1880s was Italian O che poco! 'Oh how little!'--a reference to price, presumably, rather than quantity--which is given some plausibility by the fact that many ice-cream sellers at that time were Italian).

Food historians tell us ice cream, as we know it, was &quot;invented&quot; in the 17th century and proliferated in the 18th. These early recipes were generally based on the same creams used for trifles. The difference? Freezing technique. Victorians prided themselves on fancy ice cream &quot;bombes&quot; (ice cream molded into special shapes). A survey of old cookbooks confirms biscuits (Savoy, sponge) were sometimes used to line the mold that held the ice cream. Voila!

The Italian word sorbetto and the English sherbert come from these sweet fruit syrups that the Arabs once drank diluted with ice water. The passage from sarbat and water, chilled in a container of ice, to granita was only a question of time, perhaps the chance invention of a housewife distracted by a passing vendor or a crying child. Sicilians always claim an Arabic origin for their ices, although in her book on Middle Eastern food Claudia Roden cites neither an Arabic name nor a Levantine history for the granita recipes she gives.

Roman emperors had ice brought from the mountains, and the kings of Egypt had snow shipped to them from Lebanon...Easterners, especially in the Turkish Empire, frequently consumed iced fruit drinks, and the people of Greece sold snow in the markets of Athens from as early as the fifth century BC.

The mixture should not be beaten during freezing. When it has set, some Italian meringue can be added to give it volume. Historically, sorbets were the first iced desserts (ice creams did not appear until ith 18th century). The Chinese introduced them to the Persians and Arabs who introduced them to the Italians. The word sorbet is a gallicazation of the Italian sorbetto, derived from Turkish chobet and Arab charah, which simply meant drink.

He has combined dried whole milk with extract of wheat and malted barley in powder and tablet form, and his &quot;diastoid&quot; is the first dried whole milk that will keep....&quot;<br />---<em>The Food Chronology</em>, James L.Trager [Henry Holt:New York] 1995 (p. 317) </p><strong><p>What about milk shakes? </p></strong> <p>&quot;Milk shake...When the term first appeared in print in 1885, milk shakes may have contained whiskey of some kind, but by the turn of the century they were considered wholesome drinks made with chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla syrups. In different parts of the country they went by different names...A &quot;malted&quot; is made with malted milk powder-invented in 1887 by William Horlick of Racine Wisconsin, and made from dried milk, malted barley, and wheat flour-promoted at first as a drink for invalids and children. By the 1930s a malt shop' was a soda fountain not attached to a pharmacy.&quot;<br />---<em>The Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</em>, John F. Mariani [Lebhar-Friedman:New York] 1999 (p. 206) </p><p>&quot;Milk shake also appeared in the late 1880s, but the term then usually meant a sturdy, healthful eggnog type of drink, with eggs, whiskey, etc., served as a tonic as well as a treat. Since malted milk was also considered a tonic, the combined malted milk shake was a logical step and in the early 1900s people were asking for the new treat, often with ice cream, and before 1910 were using the shorter terms shake and malt (the longer word malted being somewhat more common in the Eastern states). Malt shop was a term of the late 1930s, usually being a typical soda fountain of the period, especially one used by students as a meeting place or hangout.&quot;<br />---<em>Listening to America</em>, Stuart Berg Flexner [Simon &amp; Schuster:New York] 1982 (p. 178) </p><p>If you need additional information on the history of soda fountains &amp; other ice cream products ask your librarian to help you find this book:<br /><em>The Great American Ice Cream Book</em>, Paul Dickson<br />&amp; check out: <a href="http://www.nsda.org/SoftDrinks/History/history.html"><u>The history of soft drinks</u></a> (ie soda fountains!) </p><strong><p>Neapolitan ice cream<br />Although Italian ice and granita trace their roots to ancient times, Neapolitan ice cream seems to be a 19th century phenomenon. Recipes for the fancy molds (bombes) or bricks of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry (sometimes pistachio) were often included in 19th century European and American cook books. This was a function of technology (refrigeration advancements) and collective gastronomy (preference for complicated presentations). Why &quot;Neapolitan?&quot; The peoples of Napoli are credited for introducing their famous ice creams to the world in the 19th century. At that time, pressed blocks composed of special flavors were trendy. The best ones were made with &quot;Neapolitan-style&quot; ice creams. </p></strong><p>A survey of historic cookbooks confirms the term &quot;Neapolitan,&quot; as it relates to ice cream, denotes both a recipe (for ice cream) and method (combining several flavors in a mold). It also reveals there is no &quot;official&quot; triumvirate of flavors. Most often cited are vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and pistachio. It is not unusual to include a sherbet or fruit-flavored ice as well. </p><p>This is what the food historians have to say: <br />&quot;Neapolitan slice. A slice of ice-cream cake made with mousse mixture and ordinary ice cream, presented in a small pleated paper case. Neapolitan ice cream consists of three layers, each of a different color and flavor (chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla), moulded into a block and cut into slices. Neapolitan ice-cream makers were famous in Paris at the beginning of the 19th century, especially Tortoni, creator of numerous ice-cream cakes.&quot;<br />---<em>Larousse Gastronomique</em>, Jenifer Harvey Lang [Crown:New York] 1988 (p. 718) </p><p>&quot;[18th century] confectioners's shops [were] very often run by Italians.

This dessert was not served in tall, thin glassware as we know today. It was extracted from the mold (of similar shape) and served on decorated plates. </p><p>Layered, molded ice cream treats (with fruits, syrups &amp; liqueurs) were quite popular by the mid-19th century both in Europe and America. They were presented in many fabulous shapes much to the delight of diners of all ages. Parfait, as is currently known by Americans is a multi-layered ice cream treat presented in &quot;parfait&quot; glasses. These glasses are typically thin and tall. The parfait is usually made with rich vanilla ice cream accented with liqueur or other other syrup (chocolate, strawberry) . The most notable difference between an American parfait and the ever popular Ice Cream Sundae is the dish. The parfait is presented tall &amp; thin; the sundae is most often served in a wide-mouth glass that may or may not have a stem. The use of liqueur is generally relegated to the parfait. Did you know? Parfait is the French word for &quot;perfect.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Parfait. An iced dessert made with double (heavy) cream, which gives it smoothness, prevents it from melting too quickly and enables it to be cut into slices. Originally the parfait was a coffee-flavoured ice cream; today, the basic mixture is a flavoured custard-cream, a flavoured syrup mixed with egg yolks or a fruit puree, which is blended with whipped ccream and then frozen. There is a special parfait mould in the shape of a cylindar with one slightly rounded end...In Britain and the United States a parfait is also the name of a whipped dessert.&quot;<br />--<em>Larousse Gastonomique</em>, Completely revised and updated [Clarkson Potter:New York] 2001 (p. 840) </p><p>&quot;Parfait. A name properly used of a rich frozen dessert, similar to a bombe and often made in a bombe mold. A typical parfait is composed of two or several elements (a lining for the mould and a filling, which may itself be layered) and is flavoured with a liqueur, or with coffee, chocolate, praline, etc. In North America, the term has come to mean something different, namely a combination of fruit and ice cream, served in a tall narrow glass which exposes to view the various layers of the confection. This sort of parfait is not a frozen dessert. However, the frozen dessert version can be frozen in individual parfait glasses, rather than in a single mould, so there is a relationship between the two different things.&quot;<br />---<em>Oxford Companion to Food</em>, Alan Davidson [Oxford University Press:Oxford] 1999 (p. 575) </p><p>The oldest recipe we have with the name parfait is from a French cookbook dated 1869.

These ranged from hand-pushed carts to goat-pulled mini-wagons to bicycle-propelled carts to horsedrawn/electric trucks. Folks who make a living selling ice treats from carts were known as &quot;hokey pokey&quot; men. How long before these treats would melt? That would be determined by the quality of the cart and the temperature of the day. The history of the popsicle is a fascnating topic unto itself. Like the history of many popular frozen treats, it is full of conflicting claims and culinary folklore. While Frank Epperson is generally credited for &quot;inventing&quot; the popsicle (first called the Epsicle, after himself), there is ample evidence that frozen fruit treats and juice bars existed in the late 19th century. These treats were often hawked by people of Italian descent, who were versed in the fine art of granita. Even the Epperson story has many &quot;versions.&quot; The Epperson story sticks not because he was the first, but because he was the first to mass market this product. </p><p>About Frank Epperson's popsicle </p><p>&quot;The third member of the great novelty trimuvirate of the 1920s was born on a cold eureka-shouting morning in New Jersey in 1923. The inventor was Frank Epperson, who made lemonade from a specially prepared powder that he sold at an Oakland, California, amusement park. While visiting friends in New Jersey, he prepared a batch of special lemonade and inadvertantly left a glass of it on a windowsill with a spoon in it. The temperature went down below zero during the night and in the morning Epperson saw the glass. He picked it up by the spoon handle and ran hot water over the glass freeing the frozen mass. In his hand was the first Epsicle, later to be known as the Popsicle. Epperson saw immediately the potential of what he held in his hand and applied for a patent, which was granted in 1924. He was fortunate, because research conducted by <em>The Ice Cream Review</em> in 1925 revealed that a major ice cream company was experimenting with &quot;frozen suckers&quot; at the time of the windowsill incident, and as far back as 1872 two men doing business as Ross and Robbins sold a frozen-fruit confection on a stick, which they called the Hokey-Pokey.&quot;<br />---<em>Great American Ice Cream Book</em>, Paul Dickson [Atheneum:New York] 1972 (p. 83) </p><p>&quot;In 1905 an eleven-year-old boy named Frank Epperson, of Oakland, California, accientally left a mixing stick in a glass of juice on a windowsill while visiting friends in New Jersey. The juice froze with the stick in it, enabling the ice to be held in the hand and licked.In 1922 Epperson introduced this new &quot;icelollipop&quot; at a fireman's ball in Oakland, California, and called it an &quot;Epsicle,&quot; then later &quot;Popsicle.&quot; (Frozen &quot;juice bars&quot; had been known in the nineteenth century, including one called the &quot;Hokey Pokey,&quot; but none was marketed well until the Popsicle in 1923.)&quot;<br />---<em>Encyclopedia of American Food and Drink</em>, John F.

How it found its way from the South American highlands into those little sacks of McDonald's fries is a long, adventurous tale, involving Conquistadors, Marie Antoinette, and Thomas Jefferson. Millionaires have been made and millions more have died from dependence on that simple, innocent potato. Here, then, is the story of the spud, which reached its crowning achievement only once it had been paired with oil.<p>The potato seems to us today to be such a staple food that it is hard to believe that it has only been accepted as edible by most of the Western world for the past 200 years. Our story begins thousands of years ago, in South America&mdash;Peru, Ecuador, and the Northern part of Chile, to be exact&mdash;where the Andean Incas </p><p>first discovered potatoes growing wild in the highlands, and were cultivating them as early as 750 BC. As well as being their staple source of food, the Incas also used potatoes for telling time, treating illness and injury, and divination. They worshipped potato deities, and when potato crops failed, the noses and lips of a few unlucky Incas would be mutilated in ceremonies designed to appease the potato gods. Although the Incas did many things with their potatoes, they did not fry them. Instead, their most popular potato dish involved laying them out in the sun for a period of weeks, then trampling on them with their bare feet to get all of the liquids out. Yummy. </p><p>Potatoes were a well-kept Incan secret for thousands of years, as were the Incas themselves, until, in the early decades of the sixteenth century, the Spanish conquered the Incan empire and brought some of the strange little tubers back to Spain with them. The Spaniards, however, were not too keen on consuming what they called an &quot;edible stone.&quot; Nevertheless, the invading soldiers in South America used the vegetable as emergency provisions, and it was there that the English were introduced to the charming spud. In 1596, Englishman Sir Francis Drake, setting sail for England after having successfully battled the Spanish in the Caribbean, grabbed up some potatoes for the trip, and made a stopover in Virginia to pick up some homesick British colonialists. One of these passengers took a sample of this intriguing plant to his horticulturist friend, John Gerard. Gerard mistakenly believed the potatoes to have come from Virginia, and, described them to the world in his 1597 <em>Herball</em> as Virginia potatoes. In fact, it was not for another century and a half that the potato would even set foot in Virginia, which it did only after having crossed the Atlantic ocean once more, finally arriving in North America in the hands of Irishmen settling in New Hampshire.</p><p>In fact, overseas, nobody but the Irish were willing to actually eat this hearty little vegetable. Sir Walter Raleigh was cultivating potatoes on the Emerald Isles as early as 1576, but when he presented them to Queen Elizabeth, it was a disaster: the cook served the greens to the Queen and threw away the tubers. She was not pleased, and rejected the disgusting meal. Although this was bad news for the struggling staple, it was not the only negative publicity it was to receive in Europe. The Scots found no mention of the potato in the Bible and deemed the vegetable unholy; horticulturists discovered it to be in the same family as such plants as belladonna and feared that it was poisonous; the innocent potato was even thought to be a cause of leprosy when it was found that a substance in the tuber (solanine) could result in a skin-rash. The Irish, however, could not afford to be so cautious. They were suffering from inadequate food supplies, and the tuber grew fabulously in their climate. Possibly as a result of it's popularity in Ireland and concurrent population explosion, the misunderstood potato even became known as an aphrodisiac. In 1733, the English seedsman Stephen Switzer summed up popular opinion of the potato as &quot;that which was heretofore reckon'd a food fit only for Irishmen and clowns.&quot;</p><p>The potato arrived in Germany in 1588 and was considered suitable only for livestock and prisoners, until 1744 when King William ordered peasants to plant potatoes to save them from famine. He distributed potatoes and instructions for planting them to the lowly folk, and threatened to cut off the nose of anyone who disobeyed.</p><p>It was in Germany, too, that the potato met it's greatest ally. Antoine August Parmentier was a French chemist who served as a soldier in the Seven Years War, and was fed only potatoes while in captivity there. When he returned to France, he made it his mission to popularize the tuber, which he felt had been</p><p>unjustly rejected by his countrymen. A skillful public relations man, Parmentier published a thesis, &quot;Inquiry into nourishing vegetables that at times of necessity could be substituted for ordinary food&quot; in 1773, and soon afterwards brought a bouquet of potato flowers to the birthday party of King Louis XVI. Graciously accepting the gift, the King promptly placed the flower in his lapel, and his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette, wore them in her hair, and potato flowers quickly became a fashion among the aristocracy. Still, Legrand d'Aussy wrote of the potato, in his 1783 <em>Histoire de la Vie Privee des Francais</em> (History of the Private Life of the French) &quot;The pasty taste, the natural insipidity, the unhealthy quality of this food, which is flatulent and indigestible, has caused it to be rejected from refined households.&quot;</p><p>Parmentier, however, was on a roll. He began throwing parties for the French upper-class, at which he served as many as twenty dishes at a time, all containing potatoes. Then, in a display of marketing genius, Parmentier obtained permission to plant an acre of potatoes in the French countryside. He had the plot fastidiously guarded by day, but at night left the land unsupervised. Acting exactly according to his predictions, the peasants assumed that anything watched so closely must be valuable, and they stole the plants by night. Soon, potatoes were being planted all over France. It became a staple food as well as a status symbol, and by 1813, almost one hundred and fifty years since it's introduction, the potato finally gained acceptance in Scotland, Holland, Austria, Switzerland, Germany and Italy. Thanks to the French, potatoes were finally deemed chic enough to eat.</p><p>The Irish dependence on potatoes not only accounts for their great immigration to the United States after the potato famines of 1845, but also resulted in Irishmen making their way to these shores in the mid 1700's, when a crop failure resulted in the deaths of one fifth of the Irish population. These earlier immigrants brought their beloved spud to America but it received little attention. It was not until an adventurous farmer and admitted Francophile&mdash;Thomas Jefferson&mdash;began to cultivate them that Americans developed a taste for the tuber, although some were still insisting that they were poisonous.</p><p>It was not long after this widespread embracing of the potato that some genius decided to drop slices of it into a pot of boiling fat. The identity of this individual is unknown; the </p><p>French claim it was one of their countrymen, while the Belgians fiercely hold that it was one of their own who first frenched a fry. Expert opinion on this matter is divided as well. Whatever the case, by the 1830's deep fried potatoes had become a popular taste sensation in both France and Belgium. It took another hundred years for them to become a fast-food staple in the United States. Although Thomas Jefferson is rumored to have served them in Monticello as early as 1802&mdash;a daring thing to do at the time, since tubers were still believed to lead to death unless the poisons were boiled out of them&mdash;it was American soldiers, having been stationed in France (or Belgium, depending on who you ask) during World War I who brought back a hunger for the fried potatoes they had eaten while overseas. Although today fries are commonly eaten in many other countries, they are only associated with the Gallic culture here in the U.S. </p><p>French fries were born to be fast food. Deep frying foods in large vats of (expensive) fat is a smelly and messy task that was impossible for most people to carry out in their humble </p><p>kitchens. At the beginning of their popularity, one's only chance to obtain the delectable treat was at a restaurant, whose cooking facilities were better equipped to handle such a procedure, or from street vendors in Paris and Brussels. (The first place in Paris to do this was by the bridge Pont Neuf, and thick-cut fries in France are still known as <em>pommes de terre Pont Neuf</em>). To this day, in Belgium, where <em>pomme frites</em> are considered a national treasure, they are still prepared from fresh potatoes and sold on the streets from numerous french-fry shacks, known as a <em>fritures</em> or <em>frietkoets</em>. </p><p>Given the difficulty of preparing the perfect fry, it is truly a wonder that McDonald's manages to turn out millions of them each day. But that, too, was a process that took decades to perfect. A long, long time ago, when the McDonald brothers opened their first restaurant in Des Plaines, Iowa, the fries they served were made from fresh potatoes, but unlike today, they were not all uniformly yummy. Sometimes limp, sometimes greasy, sometimes too dark on the outside and not cooked enough on the inside, the path to total fry perfection constantly eluded them. The little restaurant quickly developed into a large food chain, but the brothers remained frustrated with their fries. They began pouring millions of dollars into research. At first, they tried to establish the perfect temperature for frying. What they found was that different batches of potatoes would reduce the temperature of the oil they were hurled into by different amounts. Fixing the frying equipment was not going to help this problem. Instead, they discovered that the variance was due to how long the potatoes had been stored before they met their fate in the fryer. The spuds that had been waiting for longer periods cooked up better than those that went immediately into the fryer. Curing potatoes for exactly three weeks prior to frying them became standard practice, allowing for enough of the spuds sugars to be converted into starches. Without this waiting period, the sugars in the potato make the fry turn brown too quickly.</p><p>But McDonald's potato predicament was far from over. There were questions about the best shortening to use, how to cultivate the right breed of potato that would contain the </p><p>perfect amount of solids to water ratio, and whether to switch over to the two-step frying method (which had been used in Belgium for years). In 1957, the company even opened a research lab dedicated to turning the production of fries from an art into a science. The labs developed a potato computer, used to this day, which could monitor the temperature of the frying oil and notify the operator when a batch of fries was perfectly cooked. Flawless French fries had finally become a reality.</p><p>Today, French fries account for more than one-fourth of all potatoes sold in the U.S. market&mdash;over six million pounds of potatoes are processed into frozen fries annually. Twenty-five percent of kids report eating French fries instead of other vegetables, and the average American eats thirty pounds of the greasy things in a year. The potato has come from being reviled to being revered, and is now the second most popular staple food in the world. So the next time someone says, &quot;You want fries with that?&quot;, take a moment to remember the long, hard journey of the poor little spud. And answer, &quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; </p><p><br /><br /><strong>Debbie Stoller, under the alias Celina Hex, is a coeditor of </strong><a href="http://www.bust.com/"><strong><u>BUST</u></strong></a><strong> magazine.

                              <strong>Franklin Roosevelt's Annual Address to Congress - The &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; <br /></strong><p align="center">January 6, 1941 </p><p align="left">Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Seventy-seventh Congress: </p><p align="left">I address you, the Members of the Seventy-seventh Congress, at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union. I use the word &quot;unprecedented,&quot; because at no previous time has American security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today. </p><p align="left">Since the permanent formation of our Government under the Constitution, in 1789, most of the periods of crisis in our history have related to our domestic affairs. Fortunately, only one of these--the four-year War Between the States--ever threatened our national unity. Today, thank God, one hundred and thirty million Americans, in forty-eight States, have forgotten points of the compass in our national unity. </p><p align="left">It is true that prior to 1914 the United States often had been disturbed by events in other Continents. We had even engaged in two wars with European nations and in a number of undeclared wars in the West Indies, in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific for the maintenance of American rights and for the principles of peaceful commerce. But in no case had a serious threat been raised against our national safety or our continued independence. </p><p align="left">What I seek to convey is the historic truth that the United States as a nation has at all times maintained clear, definite opposition, to any attempt to lock us in behind an ancient Chinese wall while the procession of civilization went past. Today, thinking of our children and of their children, we oppose enforced isolation for ourselves or for any other part of the Americas. </p><p align="left">That determination of ours, extending over all these years, was proved, for example, during the quarter century of wars following the French Revolution. </p><p align="left">While the Napoleonic struggles did threaten interests of the United States because of the French foothold in the West Indies and in Louisiana, and while we engaged in the War of 1812 to vindicate our right to peaceful trade, it is nevertheless clear that neither France nor Great Britain, nor any other nation, was aiming at domination of the whole world. </p><p align="left">In like fashion from 1815 to 1914-- ninety-nine years-- no single war in Europe or in Asia constituted a real threat against our future or against the future of any other American nation. </p><p align="left">Except in the Maximilian interlude in Mexico, no foreign power sought to establish itself in this Hemisphere; and the strength of the British fleet in the Atlantic has been a friendly strength. It is still a friendly strength. </p><p align="left">Even when the World War broke out in 1914, it seemed to contain only small threat of danger to our own American future. But, as time went on, the American people began to visualize what the downfall of democratic nations might mean to our own democracy. </p><p align="left">We need not overemphasize imperfections in the Peace of Versailles. We need not harp on failure of the democracies to deal with problems of world reconstruction. We should remember that the Peace of 1919 was far less unjust than the kind of &quot;pacification&quot; which began even before Munich, and which is being carried on under the new order of tyranny that seeks to spread over every continent today. The American people have unalterably set their faces against that tyranny. </p><p align="left">Every realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment being' directly assailed in every part of the world--assailed either by arms, or by secret spreading of poisonous propaganda by those who seek to destroy unity and promote discord in nations that are still at peace. </p><p align="left">During sixteen long months this assault has blotted out the whole pattern of democratic life in an appalling number of independent nations, great and small. The assailants are still on the march, threatening other nations, great and small. </p><p align="left">Therefore, as your President, performing my constitutional duty to &quot;give to the Congress information of the state of the Union,&quot; I find it, unhappily, necessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far beyond our borders. </p><p align="left">Armed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four continents. If that defense fails, all the population and all the resources of Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia will be dominated by the conquerors. Let us remember that the total of those populations and their resources in those four continents greatly exceeds the sum total of the population and the resources of the whole of the Western Hemisphere-many times over. </p><p align="left">In times like these it is immature--and incidentally, untrue--for anybody to brag that an unprepared America, single-handed, and with one hand tied behind its back, can hold off the whole world. </p><p align="left">No realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion -or even good business. </p><p align="left">Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. &quot;Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot; </p><p align="left">As a nation, we may take pride in the fact that we are softhearted; but we cannot afford to be soft-headed. </p><p align="left">We must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal preach the &quot;ism&quot; of appeasement. </p><p align="left">We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests. </p><p align="left">I have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nations win this war. </p><p align="left">There is much loose talk of our immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the seas. Obviously, as long as the British Navy retains its power, no such danger exists. Even if there were no British Navy, it is not probable that any enemy would be stupid enough to attack us by landing troops in the United States from across thousands of miles of ocean, until it had acquired strategic bases from which to operate. </p><p align="left">But we learn much from the lessons of the past years in Europe-particularly the lesson of Norway, whose essential seaports were captured by treachery and surprise built up over a series of years. </p><p align="left">The first phase of the invasion of this Hemisphere would not be the landing of regular troops. The necessary strategic points would be occupied by secret agents and their dupes- and great numbers of them are already here, and in Latin America. </p><p align="left">As long as the aggressor nations maintain the offensive, they-not we--will choose the time and the place and the method of their attack. </p><p align="left">That is why the future of all the American Republics is today in serious danger. </p><p align="left">That is why this Annual Message to the Congress is unique in our history. </p><p align="left">That is why every member of the Executive Branch of the Government and every member of the Congress faces great responsibility and great accountability. </p><p align="left">The need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily-almost exclusively--to meeting this foreign peril. For all our domestic problems are now a part of the great emergency. </p><p align="left">Just as our national policy in internal affairs has been based upon a decent respect for the rights and the dignity of all our fellow men within our gates, so our national policy in foreign affairs has been based on a decent respect for the rights and dignity of all nations, large and small. And the justice of morality must and will win in the end. <br />Our national policy is this: </p><p align="left">First, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to all-inclusive national defense. </p><p align="left">Second, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to full support of all those resolute peoples, everywhere, who are resisting aggression and are thereby keeping war away from our Hemisphere. By this support, we express our determination that the democratic cause shall prevail; and we strengthen the defense and the security of our own nation. </p><p align="left">Third, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to the proposition that principles of morality and considerations for our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored by appeasers. We know that enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people's freedom. </p><p align="left">In the recent national election there was no substantial difference between the two great parties in respect to that national policy. No issue was fought out on this line before the American electorate. Today it is abundantly evident that American citizens everywhere are demanding and supporting speedy and complete action in recognition of obvious danger. </p><p align="left">Therefore, the immediate need is a swift and driving increase in our armament production. </p><p align="left">Leaders of industry and labor have responded to our summons. Goals of speed have been set. In some cases these goals are being reached ahead of time; in some cases we are on schedule; in other cases there are slight but not serious delays; and in some cases--and I am sorry to say very important cases--we are all concerned by the slowness of the accomplishment of our plans. </p><p align="left">The Army and Navy, however, have made substantial progress during the past year. Actual experience is improving and speeding up our methods of production with every passing day. And today's best is not good enough for tomorrow. </p><p align="left">I am not satisfied with the progress thus far made. The men in charge of the program represent the best in training, in ability, and in patriotism. They are not satisfied with the progress thus far made. None of us will be satisfied until the job is done. </p><p align="left">No matter whether the original goal was set too high or too low, our objective is quicker and better results. To give you two illustrations: </p><p align="left">We are behind schedule in turning out finished airplanes; we are working day and night to solve the innumerable problems and to catch up. </p><p align="left">We are ahead of schedule in building warships but we are working to get even further ahead of that schedule. </p><p align="left">To change a whole nation from a basis of peacetime production of implements of peace to a basis of wartime production of implements of war is no small task. And the greatest difficulty comes at the beginning of the program, when new tools, new plant facilities, new assembly lines, and new ship ways must first be constructed before the actual materiel begins to flow steadily and speedily from them. </p><p align="left">The Congress, of course, must rightly keep itself informed at all times of the progress of the program. However, there is certain information, as the Congress itself will readily recognize, which, in the interests of our own security and those of the nations that we are supporting, must of needs be kept in confidence. </p><p align="left">New circumstances are constantly begetting new needs for our safety. I shall ask this Congress for greatly increased new appropriations and authorizations to carry on what we have begun. </p><p align="left">I also ask this Congress for authority and for funds sufficient to manufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds, to be turned over to those nations which are now in actual war with aggressor nations. </p><p align="left">Our most useful and immediate role is to act as an arsenal for them as well as for ourselves. They do not need man power, but they do need billions of dollars worth of the weapons of defense. </p><p align="left">The time is near when they will not be able to pay for them all in ready cash. We cannot, and we will not, tell them that they must surrender, merely because of present inability to pay for the weapons which we know they must have. </p><p align="left">I do not recommend that we make them a loan of dollars with which to pay for these weapons--a loan to be repaid in dollars. </p><p align="left">I recommend that we make it possible for those nations to continue to obtain war materials in the United States, fitting their orders into our own program. Nearly all their materiel would, if the time ever came, be useful for our own defense. </p><p align="left">Taking counsel of expert military and naval authorities, considering what is best for our own security, we are free to decide how much should be kept here and how much should be sent abroad to our friends who by their determined and heroic resistance are giving us time in which to make ready our own defense. </p><p align="left">For what we send abroad, we shall be repaid within a reasonable time following the close of hostilities, in similar materials, or, at our option, in other goods of many kinds, which they can produce and which we need. </p><p align="left">Let us say to the democracies: &quot;We Americans are vitally concerned in your defense of freedom. We are putting forth our energies, our resources and our organizing powers to give you the strength to regain and maintain a free world. We shall send you, in ever-increasing numbers, ships, planes, tanks, guns. This is our purpose and our pledge.&quot; </p><p align="left">In fulfillment of this purpose we will not be intimidated by the threats of dictators that they will regard as a breach of international law or as an act of war our aid to the democracies which dare to resist their aggression. Such aid is not an act of war, even if a dictator should unilaterally proclaim it so to be. </p><p align="left">When the dictators, if the dictators, are ready to make war upon us, they will not wait for an act of war on our part. They did not wait for Norway or Belgium or the Netherlands to commit an act of war. </p><p align="left">Their only interest is in a new one-way international law, which lacks mutuality in its observance, and, therefore, becomes an instrument of oppression. </p><p align="left">The happiness of future generations of Americans may well depend upon how effective and how immediate we can make our aid felt. No one can tell the exact character of the emergency situations that we may be called upon to meet. The Nation's hands must not be tied when the Nation's life is in danger. </p><p align="left">We must all prepare to make the sacrifices that the emergency-almost as serious as war itself--demands. Whatever stands in the way of speed and efficiency in defense preparations must give way to the national need. </p><p align="left">A free nation has the right to expect full cooperation from all groups. A free nation has the right to look to the leaders of business, of labor, and of agriculture to take the lead in stimulating effort, not among other groups but within their own groups. </p><p align="left">The best way of dealing with the few slackers or trouble makers in our midst is, first, to shame them by patriotic example, and, if that fails, to use the sovereignty of Government to save Government. </p><p align="left">As men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone. Those who man our defenses, and those behind them who build our defenses, must have the stamina and the courage which come from unshakable belief in the manner of life which they are defending. The mighty action that we are calling for cannot be based on a disregard of all things worth fighting for. </p><p align="left">The Nation takes great satisfaction and much strength from the things which have been done to make its people conscious of their individual stake in the preservation of democratic life in America. Those things have toughened the fibre of our people, have renewed their faith and strengthened their devotion to the institutions we make ready to protect. </p><p align="left">Certainly this is no time for any of us to stop thinking about the social and economic problems which are the root cause of the social revolution which is today a supreme factor in the world. </p><p align="left">For there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy. The basic things expected by our people of their political and economic systems are simple. They are: </p><p align="left">Equality of opportunity for youth and for others. <br />Jobs for those who can work. <br />Security for those who need it. <br />The ending of special privilege for the few. <br />The preservation of civil liberties for all. </p><p align="left">The enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living. </p><p align="left">These are the simple, basic things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of our modern world. The inner and abiding strength of our economic and political systems is dependent upon the degree to which they fulfill these expectations. </p><p align="left">Many subjects connected with our social economy call for immediate improvement. <br />As examples: </p><p align="left">We should bring more citizens under the coverage of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. </p><p align="left">We should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care. </p><p align="left">We should plan a better system by which persons deserving or needing gainful employment may obtain it. </p><p align="left">I have called for personal sacrifice. I am assured of the willingness of almost all Americans to respond to that call. </p><p align="left">A part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money in taxes. In my Budget Message I shall recommend that a greater portion of this great defense program be paid for from taxation than we are paying today. No person should try, or be allowed, to get rich out of this program; and the principle of tax payments in accordance with ability to pay should be constantly before our eyes to guide our legislation. </p><p align="left">If the Congress maintains these principles, the voters, putting patriotism ahead of pocketbooks, will give you their applause. </p><p align="left">In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms. </p><p align="left">The first is freedom of speech and expression--everywhere in the world. </p><p align="left">The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way--everywhere in the world. </p><p align="left">The third is freedom from want--which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants-everywhere in the world. </p><p align="left">The fourth is freedom from fear--which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor--anywhere in the world. </p><p align="left">That is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so-called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb. </p><p align="left">To that new order we oppose the greater conception--the moral order. A good society is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear. </p><p align="left">Since the beginning of our American history, we have been engaged in change -- in a perpetual peaceful revolution -- a revolution which goes on steadily, quietly adjusting itself to changing conditions--without the concentration camp or the quick-lime in the ditch. The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries, working together in a friendly, civilized society. </p><p align="left">This nation has placed its destiny in the hands and heads and hearts of its millions of free men and women; and its faith in freedom under the guidance of God. Freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere. Our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights or keep them. Our strength is our unity of purpose. To that high concept there can be no end save victory. <br /></p>

in the 1700's, they had no idea what they were starting. </p></strong>When the pioneers of America's soft drink industry began experimenting with &quot;soda water&quot; in the 1700's, they had no idea what they were starting. <p>From those experimental beginnings, soft drinks have emerged as America's favorite refreshment: more popular than coffee, tea and juice combined. As soft drinks have grown in popularity they have become much more than the country's favorite beverage; they have contributed to the growth and prosperity of America. </p><p>More than 110,000 Americans now earn a living directly from the soft drink industry; that adds up to more than $5 billion in payroll dollars spread over towns and cities in every state across America. </p><p>But the soft drink industry is more than liquid refreshment and jobs and dollars. It is an industry that strongly believes in preserving the ideals and principles that helped it prosper from the early days to the present. During World War II, bottlers throughout the nation donated time, manpower and equipment to support the war effort. Their work resulted in the collection of more than 50 million pounds of scrap metal for manufacturing into armaments. The industry set an example for the nation in conserving precious resources by drastically changing delivery methods to save millions of gallons of crucial fuel supplies. </p><p>And during World War II, the soft drink industry donated its products to American troops serving on the front lines. </p><p>Supporting America's interests is a tradition that continues for the soft drink industry. </p><p>Soft drink companies give back to their communities in peacetime, too. The industry is a world leader in actively promoting recycling and conservation, fostering teenage drug awareness programs, supporting anti-drunk driving efforts, funding school programs, providing safe water to people in natural disaster areas through use of their water treatment systems, and organizing events to protect and improve the lives of all Americans. The soft drink industry recognizes its responsibilities to America and welcomes the opportunity to meet them. </p><p>Soft drinks are much more than America's favorite refreshment. They are a good part of America. </p><strong><p>The History of America and Soft Drinks Go Hand in Hand<br />A uniquely American industry, the manufacturing of soft drinks began in the 1830's. However, the evolution of soft drinks took place over a much longer period. The forerunners of soft drinks began more than 2,000 years ago when Hippocrates, the &quot;Father of Medicine,&quot; first suspected that mineral waters could be beneficial to our well-being. But Hippocrates did not envision drinking the effervescent mineral waters bubbling from the earth's crust. Instead, the Greeks and Romans used them for bathing and relaxation. More than a thousand years passed before mineral waters made the transition from therapeutic bath to refreshing beverage. </p></strong>A uniquely American industry, the manufacturing of soft drinks began in the 1830's. However, the evolution of soft drinks took place over a much longer period. The forerunners of soft drinks began more than 2,000 years ago when Hippocrates, the &quot;Father of Medicine,&quot; first suspected that mineral waters could be beneficial to our well-being. But Hippocrates did not envision drinking the effervescent mineral waters bubbling from the earth's crust. Instead, the Greeks and Romans used them for bathing and relaxation. More than a thousand years passed before mineral waters made the transition from therapeutic bath to refreshing beverage. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>In America, the transition resulted from the discovery of the natural springs in New York. Many legends and myths developed about the earth's mysterious waters, believed to be cures for everything from arthritis to indigestion. The claims attracted physicians and scientists who began studying the tiny bubbles fizzing from these waters. </p><p>Scientists eventually proclaimed the air being released as gas carbonium -- simple carbon dioxide. Soon after they perfected a way of producing artificially carbonated water in the laboratory. With that development, it was only a matter of time before soft drinks made it into the hands of the American public. </p><p>By the 1830's, both artificial and natural mineral waters were considered healthy and refreshing products in America. But pharmacists, believing they could improve upon their curative properties, experimented with a multitude of ingredients from birch bark to dandelions. And while no miracle cures developed, some very interesting flavors and tastes were discovered. Ginger ale, root beer, sarsaparilla, lemon and strawberry were among the most popular of the early flavors. </p><p>The soft drink industry was a seasonal business in the early days, operating primarily during the summer months. Sales were limited by few outlets for the new carbonated beverages, and by the consumer's restricted mobility. </p><p>For many years, America's pharmacists were the driving force behind the refinement of soft drinks and many of the flavors and combinations. Their association with chemistry and medicine made them ideally suited for this business, still part pharmacology and part refreshment. </p><p>The local pharmacy was the center attraction in many American towns in the mid-1800's. It was customary to gather around the new soda fountains and enjoy one's favorite refreshment mixed on the spot. However, as the corner drugstore grew in popularity, the soft drink bottling industry was taking shape. </p><p>Gradually, demand grew for soft drinks to be consumed in the home. Bottling the product proved difficult at first, since pressure from the carbon dioxide forced corks right out of the bottles. Clearly, if soft drinks were ever to be sold for consumption beyond the corner pharmacy, there would have to be a way to keep them corked. Inventors worked for years to develop a solution, patenting some 1,500 different corks, caps and lids for soft drink bottles. </p><p>Then, in 1892, the &quot;crown cap&quot; was invented. Tiny in design, the crown completely revolutionized the soft drink industry by preventing the escape of carbon dioxide from bottled beverages. In fact, it was the dominant soft drink closure for more than 70 years. </p><p>Soon the crown cap's success was being felt at the corner pharmacy. As home consumption of soft drinks grew, demand at the corner drug store began to dwindle. Many pharmacists, realizing the promising future of soft drinks, abandoned their trade to become full-time bottlers. Others began stocking soft drinks in their stores. Horse drawn wagons traveled America's streets, loaded with brand-name soft drinks and headed for growing retail outlets. </p><p>While the crown cap helped lead the way to soft drinks in the home, it was not until the 1920's that the trend took hold. The invention of &quot;Hom-Paks,&quot; the first six-pack cartons, made it more convenient to carry products back to the house. Their use resulted in the increased availability and the growing popularity of soft drinks across America. </p><p>The appearance of the automobile heralded a new era for the soft drink industry. Roadside stands appeared across the country. Service stations became major outlets for bottled refreshment, and large motorized delivery trucks were better able to satisfy the country's growing taste for liquid refreshment. </p><p>Automatic vending machines began to appear in the 1920's, once again changing the business of soft drinks. Vending machines and fountain dispensers led the way to the expansion of soft drinks to industrial outlets. Americans could now consume the popular beverage at home or at work. Today, there are more than 2.5 million soft drink vending machines in the U.S. </p><p>The mushrooming demand for product resulted in the growth of the soft drink industry, from pharmacies into a national industry. Inventors of soft drinks spread their products across America by opening a few strategically placed bottling facilities through franchise agreements. Eventually it became clear that supplying a growing nation's thirst for soft drinks would require more than a few additional bottling plants. But until the 1890's, the industry was primarily one of manual operations. Glass bottles were blown individually, while filling, sealing, mixing, and packaging were almost totally manual operations. Expansion could not occur without a more mechanized process. </p><p>That changed between 1890 and 1910. New, automated machinery was developed, making the soft drink industry more efficient and productive. The number of plants bottling soft drinks increased from 1,377 to 4,916, as sales soared. </p><p>The industrial age was in full swing, America's population was exploding and soft drink demand was booming. Together, the industry and the nation entered the era of mass production and national marketing. </p><p>New, modern machinery turned out uniform products and significantly increased the production of soft drinks. By the time The Great Depression hit, carbonated beverages already were established as part of the American way of life. Even in hard economic times, consumers were unwilling to give up soft drinks--one of the small pleasures they could still afford to enjoy. </p><p>The Depression witnessed the creation of innovative new soft drink brands and containers, which continued during the 1940's and 50's. </p><p>Responding to consumer demand, the industry rolled out soft drinks in cans and introduced diet beverages to the market. Carriers were developed for convenience and ease in taking soft drinks from the store to the home. </p><p>Together, America and its soft drink industry suffered hardships caused by World War II. Shortages of cork, sugar and steel significantly impacted the manufacturing process, but soft drinks continued to be available to the public. The soft drink industry participated in scrap metal collection drives and made significant efforts to conserve natural resources in order to support the war effort. Soft drinks were classified as &quot;essential to soldier morale&quot; by the U.S. War Department and both the soft drink industry and federal government made every effort to provide troops with products. When unable to ship soft drinks directly to the soldiers, the government sent machinery and materials so they could be made on the spot. </p><p>Since that time, the country has experienced significant progress--a man on the moon, color TV, computers and compact disc players. For the soft drink industry, it has meant the development of new flavors, the sale of canned products in vending machines, and the invention of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles. </p><p>Soft drink companies have kept pace with the nation's endless thirst for refreshment. While many things have changed throughout the years, soft drinks continue to be America's beverage of choice. Soft drinks are a good part of America. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                              <strong><p>Earliest references to beer</p></strong><p>The Chinese brewed beer called &lsquo;Kui' some 5,000 years ago. In Mesopotamia, a 4,000 year-old clay tablet indicates that brewing was a highly respected profession - and the master brewers were women.</p><p>In ancient Babylon, the women brewers were also priestesses. The goddesses Siris and Nimkasi were patronesses of beer, and certain types of beer were reserved exclusively for temple ceremonies.</p><p>In 2,100 BC Hammuabi, the 6th King of Babylonia, included provisions regulating the business of tavern keepers in his great law code. These provisions covered the sale of beer and were designed to protect the consumer. The punishment of short measure by an innkeeper was drowning, which was an effective way to prevent any repetition of the offence!</p><p>An ancient tablet now in New York's Metropolitan Museum lists Babylonian beers as: dark beer, pale beer, red beer, three fold beer, beer with a head, without a head etc. It also records that beer was sipped through a straw - in the case of royalty a golden straw, long enough to reach from the throne to a large container of beer kept nearby.</p><p>3,000 year old beer mugs were uncovered in Israel in the 1960s. Archaeologists said that their find at Tel Isdar indicated that beer drinking in Israel went back to the days of King Saul and King David. An Assyrian tablet of 2,000 BC lists beer among the foods that Noah used to provision the ark.</p><strong><p>The Egyptian era</p></strong><p>Some 5,000 years ago in the Imperial Egypt of the Pharaohs, beer was already an important food item in the daily diet. It was made from lightly baked barley bread, and also was used as a sacrament. </p><p>People gathered in the evening to drink at a &lsquo;house of beer'. Beer was the natural drink of the country, a basic in the diet of the nobility and of the fellah (the peasant). As well as being a drink, beer was also used as medicine. A medical document which was written in about 1,600 BC lists about 700 prescriptions of which about 100 contained the word &lsquo;beer'.</p><p>The Egyptians also provided their dead with food and beer. An old Egyptian tomb bears the inscription: &quot;....satisfy his spirit with beef and fowl, bread and beer&quot;. In the taverns or houses of beer in Egypt, the favourite toast was &quot;Here's to your ghost&quot;.</p><p>Beer also had status - a keg of beer was considered the only proper gift to be offered to the Pharaoh by a suitor seeking the hand of a royal princess. 30,000 gallons a year was also offered as a fitting gift to the Gods by Pharaoh Rameses II (1,200 BC). It is recorded that a similar amount was also offered to appease the gods when they became angry.</p><p>Isis, the nature goddess, was Egypt's patroness of beer brewing and an important civic official was charged with the task of maintaining the quality of beer, an integral part of everyday life and religion.</p><p>Other references to beer from Egyptian times include mention of beer brewed from barley in the Egyptian's Book of the Dead, and many ancient Egyptian wall hangings also depict the brewing of beer.</p><strong><p>The Greek and Roman era</p></strong><p>It was the Egyptians who reputedly taught the Greeks how to brew beer. </p><p>In fact it has been suggested by historians that Dionysus, the wine-god of Greek mythology, was actually a superimposition of Dionysis, the beer-god from pre-historic times.</p><p>The famous Greek writer Sophocles (450 BC) stressed moderation, and suggested a diet of &quot;bread, meat, green vegetables and zythos (beer)&quot;. Other early Greek writers, Xenophon and Herodotus, also mention beer.</p><p>The Greeks in turn taught the Romans to brew, and Julius Caesar, following the fateful crossing in 49 BC of the River Rubicon, toasted his officers with beer.</p><p>The Romans then showed the savage tribes in Britain the art of brewing.</p><p>Pliny and Tacitus are among the classical writers who record the development of the brewing art among the Celtic and Teutonic peoples of Britain and Central Europe.</p><strong><p>The Christian era</p></strong><p>Beer really came into its own with the advent of the Christian era, largely through the influence of the monasteries which brewed and improved the beer. Monks often built the first breweries as pioneers of the hotel business, providing shelter, food and drink to pilgrims and other travellers. </p><p>Three Christian saints are listed as patrons of brewing, all distinguished members of the Christian faith: Saint Augustine of Hippo, author of the confessions; Saint Luke the Evangelist; and Saint Nicholas of Myra, better known as Santa Claus.</p><p>Other saints also had links with brewing. Saint Columban, doing missionary work in Germany, found people preparing to consume a cask of beer in a ceremony to a pagan god. He blew upon the case, which fell apart, and when the crowd became penitent he miraculously increased the small amount of beer left. Saint Bright is credited with changing water into beer to feed lepers. She personally brewed ale each Easter time to supply all of the churches in the neighbourhood.</p><p>Saint Mungo, the patron saint of Scotland's oldest city, Glasgow, established a religious brotherhood there in 540 AD, and one of the brothers started brewing to supply the others. Brewing is still regarded as the oldest industry in Glasgow. Saint Patrick, according to Senchus Mor, the book of the ancient laws of Ireland (438-441 AD), numbered among his household a brewer - a priest called Mescan.</p><strong><p>Medieval times</p></strong><p>The Emperor Charlemagne (AD 742-814), the great Christian ruler, considered beer as essential for moderate living, and personally trained the realm's brewmasters. King Arthur served his Knights of the Round Table with beer called bragget. </p><p>Even in medieval times, beer was generally brewed by women. Being the cooks, they had responsibility for beer which was regarded as &lsquo;food-drink'. After the monasteries had established the best methods of brewing, the &lsquo;ale-wives' took the responsibility for further brewing.</p><p>In England at this time a chequered flag indicated a place where ale and beer could be purchased.</p><p>Of course few people other than the clergy could read or write, and a written sign would have been of little use.</p><p>Many events of this era incorporate the word &lsquo;ale', reflecting its importance in society. Brides traditionally sold ale on their wedding day to defray the expenses - hence &lsquo;bride-ale' which became 'bridal'. The Christmas expression &lsquo;yule-tide' actually means &lsquo;ale-tide'.</p><p>Saint Thomas A'Becket, martyred archbishop of Canterbury, was selected as patron saint of one of the London Guilds, the Brewers' Company. When he went to France in 1158 to seek the hand of a French princess for Prince Henry of England, he took several barrels of British ale as gifts.</p><p>Beer was also handed out free of charge to weary travellers when the Wayfarer Dole was established in England. A Pilgrim's Dole of ale and bread can still be claimed by all wayfarers at the Hospital of St Cross, Winchester, England. This is said to have been founded by William of Wykeham, (1367-1404), and was claimed by Emerson, the American essayist, when visiting Winchester.</p><strong><p>1400 onwards</p></strong><p>Today, &quot;ale&quot; and &quot;beer&quot; are used as interchangeable terms. However, ale, which consisted of malt (usually made from barley although other grains were used), water and yeast, was replaced at the start of the 15th century by beer. Introduced from Flanders, beer was bittered with hops and kept better than English ale because of the preservative quality of the hops. </p><p>By the end of the century, beer had almost completely replaced the old English sweet ale, and was being exported to Europe. Records dating back to the 15th century show that almost half of the ships' cargoes taken across the North Sea and the Baltic Sea were barrels of beer.</p><p>Until the middle of the 16th century, beer making was mainly a family operation and had little commercial application. However, it was certainly an integral part of everyday diet.</p><p>Ladies-in-waiting at the court of Henry VII were allowed a gallon of beer for breakfast alone.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth, when travelling through the country, always sent couriers ahead to taste the local ale. If it didn't measure up to the quality required a supply would be shipped from London for her.</p><p>William Shakespeare's father was an ale-tester or &quot;conner&quot;. The &quot;conner&quot; tested the ale by pouring some upon a bench and sitting on it while drinking the rest. If there was sugar in the ale, or it was impure, their leather breeches would stick after sitting for half an hour or so.</p><p>The Dean of St Pauls, in the 16th century, is credited with the invention of bottled ale. Dr Alexander Norwell put ale in a bottle when he went fishing and left the bottle in the grass. Returning some years later he found the cork came away with an explosion but the taste and quality of the ale was still good.</p><p>European beer first arrived in America with Christopher Columbus' ships. On his last voyage to America in 1502, Columbus found the natives of Central America making a first-rate brew &quot;of maize, resembling English beer&quot;. The Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth Rock, instead of further south as planned, partly because they were out of beer.</p><p>A journal entry dated December 19, 1620 said: &quot;We could not take time for further search or consideration; our victuals being much spent, especially our beer&quot;.</p><p>At the end of the 17th century, the weekly allowance for pupils of all ages at one English school was two bottles a day. Beer was a good deal safer and more palatable than the available drinking water which was often drawn from polluted rivers. And beer was also common in the workplace. The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, who lived in London from 1757-1774, recorded the daily beer consumption in a London printing house which he visited. The employees each had a pint before breakfast, a pint between breakfast and dinner, a pint at dinner, a pint at six o'clock and a pint when they finished work</p>

                              <p align="center">The History of the Potato Chip</p><p>1853, Saratoga Springs, New York</p><p>As a world food, potatoes are second in human consumption only to rice. And as thin, salted, crisp chips, they are America's favorite snack food. Potato chips originated in New England as one man's variation on the French-fried potato, and their production was the result not of a sudden stroke of culinary invention but of a fit of pique.</p><p>In the summer of 1853, American Indian George Crum was employed as a chef at an elegant resort in Saratoga Springs, New York. On Moon Lake Lodge's restaurant menu were French-fried potatoes, prepared by Crum in the standard, thick-cut French style that was popularized in France in the 1700s and enjoyed by Thomas Jefferson as ambassador to that country. Ever since Jefferson brought the recipe to America and served French fries to guests at Monticello, the dish was popular and serious dinner fare.</p><p>At Moon Lake Lodge, one dinner guest found chef Crum's French fries too thick for his liking and rejected the order. Crum cut and fried a thinner batch, but these, too, met with disapproval. Exasperated, Crum decided to rile the guest by producing French fries too thin and crisp to skewer with a fork.</p><p>The plan backfired. The guest was ecstatic over the browned, paper-thin potatoes, and other diners requested Crum's potato chips, which began to appear on the menu as Saratoga Chips, a house specialty. Soon they were packaged and sold, first locally, then throughout the New England area. Crum eventually opened his own restaurant, featuring chips. At that time, potatoes were tediously peeled and sliced by hand. It was the invention of the mechanical potato peeler in the 1920s that paved the way for potato chips to soar from a small specialty item to a top-selling snack food.</p><p>For several decades after their creation, potato chips were largely a Northern dinner dish. In the 1920s, Herman Lay, a traveling salesman in the South, helped popularize the food from Atlanta to Tennessee. Lay peddled potato chips to Southern grocers out of the trunk of his car, building a business and a name that would become synonymous with the thin, salty snack. Lay's potato chips became the first successfully marketed national brand, and in 1961 Herman Lay, to increase his line of goods, merged his company with Frito, the Dallas-based producer of such snack foods as Fritos Corn Chips.</p><p>Americans today consume more potato chips (and Fritos and French fries) than any other people in the world; a reversal from colonial times, when New Englanders consigned potatoes largely to pigs as fodder and believed that eating the tubers shortened a person's life&mdash;not because potatoes were fried in fat and doused with salt, today's heart and hypertension culprits, but because the spud, in its unadulterated form, supposedly contained an aphrodisiac which led to behavior that was thought to be life shortening. Potatoes of course contain no aphrodisiac, though potato chips are frequently consumed with passion and are touted by some to be as satisfying as sex</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sausage is one of the oldest forms of processed food, having been mentioned in Homer's Odyssey as far back as the 9th Century B.C. </p><p>Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, is traditionally credited with originating the frankfurter. However, this claim is disputed by those who assert that the popular sausage - known as a &quot;dachshund&quot; or &quot;little-dog&quot; sausage - was created in the late 1600's by Johann Georghehner, a butcher, living in Coburg, Germany. According to this report, Georghehner later traveled to Frankfurt to promote his new product. </p><p>In 1987, the city of Frankfurt celebrated the 500th birthday of the hot dog in that city. It's said that the frankfurter was developed there in 1487, five years before Christopher Columbus set sail for the new world. The people of Vienna (Wien), Austria, point to the term &quot;wiener&quot; to prove their claim as the birthplace of the hot dog. </p><p>As it turns out, it is likely that the North American hot dog comes from a widespread common European sausage brought here by butchers of several nationalities. Also in doubt is who first served the dachshund sausage with a roll. One report says a German immigrant sold them, along with milk rolls and sauerkraut, from a push cart in New York City's Bowery during the 1860's. In 1871, Charles Feltman, a German butcher opened up the first Coney Island hot dog stand selling 3,684 dachshund sausages in a milk roll during his first year in business. </p><p>The year, 1893, was an important date in hot dog history. In Chicago that year, the Colombian Exposition brought hordes of visitors who consumed large quantities of sausages sold by vendors. People liked this food that was easy to eat, convenient and inexpensive. Hot dog historian Bruce Kraig, Ph.D., retired professor emeritus at Roosevelt University, says the Germans always ate the dachshund sausages with bread. Since the sausage culture is German, it is likely that Germans introduced the practice of eating the dachshund sausages, which we today know as the hot dog, nestled in a bun. </p><p>Also in 1893, sausages became the standard fare at baseball parks. This tradition is believed to have been started by a St. Louis bar owner, Chris Von de Ahe, a German immigrant who also owned the St. Louis Browns major league baseball team. </p><p>Many hot dog historians chafe at the suggestion that today's hot dog on a bun was introduced during the St. Louis &quot;Louisiana Purchase Exposition&quot; in 1904 by Bavarian concessionaire, Anton Feuchtwanger. As the story goes, he loaned white gloves to his patrons to hold his piping hot sausages and as most of the gloves were not returned, the supply began running low. He reportedly asked his brother-in-law, a baker, for help. The baker improvised long soft rolls that fit the meat - thus inventing the hot dog bun. Kraig says everyone wants to claim the hot dog bun as their own invention, but the most likely scenario is the practice was handed down by German immigrants and gradually became widespread in American culture. </p><p>Another story that riles serious hot dog historians is how term &quot;hot dog&quot; came about. Some say the word was coined in 1901 at the New York Polo Grounds on a cold April day. Vendors were hawking hot dogs from portable hot water tanks shouting &quot;They're red hot! Get your dachshund sausages while they're red hot!&quot; A New York Journal sports cartoonist, Tad Dorgan, observed the scene and hastily drew a cartoon of barking dachshund sausages nestled warmly in rolls. Not sure how to spell &quot;dachshund&quot; he simply wrote &quot;hot dog!&quot; The cartoon is said to have been a sensation, thus coining the term &quot;hot dog.&quot; However, historians have been unable to find this cartoon, despite Dorgan's enormous body of work and his popularity. </p><p>Kraig, and other culinary historians, point to college magazines where the word &quot;hot dog&quot; began appearing in the 1890s. The term was current at Yale in the fall of 1894,when &quot;dog wagons&quot; sold hot dogs at the dorms. The name was a sarcastic comment on the provenance of the meat. References to dachshund sausages and ultimately hot dogs can be traced to German immigrants in the 1800s. These immigrants brought not only sausages to America, but dachshund dogs. The name most likely began as a joke about the Germans' small, long, thin dogs. In fact, even Germans called the frankfurter a &quot;little-dog&quot; or &quot;dachshund&quot; sausage, thus linking the word &quot;dog&quot; to their popular concoction. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                              <strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;WHEN IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVENTS...&quot;</p></strong><p>Taxation without representation! That was the battle cry of the 13 colonies in America that were forced to pay taxes to England's King George III with no representation in Parliament. As dissatisfaction grew, British troops were sent in to quell any signs of rebellion, and repeated attempts by the colonists to resolve the crisis without war proved fruitless.</p><p>On June 11, 1776, the colonies' Second Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia formed a committee with the express purpose of drafting a document that would formally sever their ties with Great Britain. The committee included Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman and Robert R. Livingston. The document was crafted by Jefferson, who was considered the strongest and most eloquent writer. (Nevertheless, a total of 86 changes were made to his draft.) The final version was officially adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4.</p><p>The following day, copies of the Declaration of Independence were distributed and, on July 6, <em>The Pennsylvania Evening Post</em> became the first newspaper to print the extraordinary document.</p><p>The Declaration of Independence has since become our nation's most cherished symbol of liberty.</p><strong><p>Bonfires and Illuminations</p></strong><p>On July 8, 1776, the first public readings of the Declaration were held in Philadelphia's Independence Square to the ringing of bells and band music. One year later, on July 4, 1777, Philadelphia marked Independence Day by adjourning Congress and celebrating with bonfires, bells and fireworks.</p><p>The custom eventually spread to other towns, both large and small, where the day was marked with processions, oratory, picnics, contests, games, military displays and fireworks. Observations throughout the nation became even more common at the end of the War of 1812 with Great Britain.</p><p>On June 24, 1826, Thomas Jefferson sent a letter to Roger C. Weightman, declining an invitation to come to Washington, D.C., to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. It was the last letter that Jefferson, who was gravely ill, ever wrote. In it, Jefferson says of the document:</p><p>&quot;May it be to the world, what I believe it will be ... the signal of arousing men to burst the chains ... and to assume the blessings and security of self-government. That form, which we have substituted, restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened, or opening, to the rights of man. ... For ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.&quot;</p><p>Congress established Independence Day as a holiday in 1870, and in 1938 Congress reaffirmed it as a holiday, but with full pay for federal employees. Today, communities across the nation mark this major midsummer holiday with parades, fireworks, picnics and the playing of the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; and marches by John Philip Sousa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

                              <strong><p>&nbsp;</p></strong><p>Many common Fourth of July traditions today have their roots in the celebrations of the early republic. On July 25, 1776, citizens of Williamsburg, Virginia celebrated the colonists' victory with military parades and cannons firing. One year to the day after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphians participated in a huge birthday bash complete with fireworks, parades, music and the firing of cannons. <br /><br />The first official Fourth of July celebration, as affirmed by a legislative act, occurred in Massachusetts in 1781. By the mid-1800s, commemorating Independence Day became a custom in US states and territories. Today, we put on parades, picnics and fireworks to honor our country's victory in the fight for freedom.<br /><br /><strong>Parades, Marching Bands and Music<br /></strong>Parades, which usually begin mid-morning, are the first tradition followed each Fourth of July. The small-town parade with baseball teams, baton twirlers and the high school marching band is a common sight in cities across the country. Fathers hoist toddlers up on their shoulders for a clear view, while children munch popcorn and wave small flags. It's a fun, inspiring way to get into a patriotic mood.<br /></p><table bordercolor="#ff0000" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="12" width="398" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="height: 101px" valign="top"><strong><p>An important note:<br />When heading to and from parades, family members' houses or the beach, don't forget that traffic will be heavy. Leave extra time to get where you're going, and be extra aware of pedestrians, rollerbladers and bike riders.</p></strong>When heading to and from parades, family members' houses or the beach, don't forget that traffic will be heavy. Leave extra time to get where you're going, and be extra aware of pedestrians, rollerbladers and bike riders.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br /><strong>Picnics and Family Get-Togethers</strong><br />After the parade, folks usually head home or to a relative's house for a family reunion or get-together. Although many families stay home and enjoy a relaxing day inside or in the backyard, it's also customary to spend the day at the beach or lake. Many public beaches have built in barbecues, so family and friends can enjoy hot barbecued ribs or chicken with fresh potato salad and sodas packed in the cooler.<br /><br /><strong>Fireworks</strong><br />When the parades are over and everyone's fingers are licked clean, the best is still yet to come&mdash;the fireworks display.<br /><br />Fireworks are one of the oldest and most stunning ways to commemorate America's birthday. Frequently the nation's colors&mdash;red, white and blue&mdash;are used in these spectacular displays of patriotism. <br /><br />Most large cities in the United States have at least one, if not several, fireworks displays on the night of the Fourth. Although watching the display from an apartment or office is likely to provide a clear view, most agree that the loud booms and crackles are necessary for proper fireworks enjoyment. For a real treat, relax on a blanket and snack on some munchies.<br /><br />The crowds, the noise and the spectacular displays all combine to provide an exciting evening for children and adults alike. Fireworks are a remarkable and satisfying conclusion to the Fourth of July holiday.<br /><br />If you have small children, consider bringing ear mufflers to the fireworks display. The loud noises can damage their ears. Also, if you have dogs or cats, don't forget that they react to fireworks, too. Close the gate to your house so they don't jump the fence, or have a family member stay at home with them. For especially sensitive animals, consult your veterinarian for advice</p><strong><p>Star Spangled July 4th Crafts and Decorations</p></strong><p>Planning your July 4th celebration can become a family event.

The song was a hit and sold more than 750,000 copies near the end of World War I. Later, when Lt. Gruber braced Mr. Sousa on this, Sousa who had been ignorant of the true origins, shared the royalties with Lt. Gruber. </p><p>Lt. Gruber had pulled his inspiration for the words to the song from an incident during a difficult march across the Zambales Mountains.

                              <strong><p>&nbsp;</p></strong><p>Independence Day celebrations can be great fun if they're held with safety considerations and awareness in mind. Because July 4th celebrations are often held outdoors, barbecues and fireworks can raise some major safety concerns. Knowing how to minimize risky behaviors will keep you, your family and friends happy and healthy this Independence Day. <br /><br /><strong><u>Firework Displays</u></strong><br />Every year, millions of Americans turn out to revel in dazzling fireworks displays. But these shows are far more complicated than meets the na&iuml;ve eye. Often, planning for the variety of fireworks used is an involved process. These pyrotechnic displays generally demand careful choreography and technical expertise. Learn more about facts and trivia about fireworks used in commercial displays.<br /><br /><strong><u>Consumer Fireworks</u></strong><br />Although most states allow the use of various types of fireworks, some have restricted or completely banned their use. If you live in a firework friendly location, be aware of the different types of fireworks. Knowing the difference between a <em>flying spinner</em> and a <em>parachute</em> will help you determine which fireworks are safest for you and your party guests.<br /><br /><strong><u>Fireworks Safety</u></strong><br />If you plan to light fireworks this year at your July 4th festivities, make sure to read up on these do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of fireworks safety. You should make sure, for example, that only adults are handling the fireworks and avoid lighting fireworks in windy weather.

In fact, more than 500 major league baseball players, including 35 <br />hall of famers, served in the military during World War II.<br /><br />The Nationals, Golden added, have embraced the U.S. military ever since <br />the franchise - formerly the Montreal Expos - moved to the nation's <br />capital last year. &quot;We had the military here on hand for the opening day <br />ceremonies; we had the National Guard carry out the giant (American) <br />flag; and we intend to continue that strong relationship,&quot; he said.<br /><br />The Nationals gave every fan a small American flag as they entered the <br />stadium, and the flags were on display throughout the game. Twenty-five <br />military children spanned the outfield to hold giant service emblems <br />for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, as the Air <br />Force's Singing Sergeants sang &quot;The Star Spangled Banner.&quot; A moment of <br />silent prayer was observed for fallen U.S. troops; and five recent <br />military veterans were joined by Medal of Honor recipient and Medal of <br />Honor Foundation board member Brian Thacker to throw the ceremonial first <br />pitches.<br /><br />Army Brig. Gen. Arthur M. Bartell, vice director of operational plans <br />and joint force development for the Joint Staff, administered the oath <br />of enlistment to the new recruits. Fans stood and cheered these latest <br />additions to the military family, as the stadium rocked to the tune of <br />Tina Turner's classic Simply the Best.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;This is just a great event,&quot; Bartell said. &quot;It shows the support of <br />the American people. The men and women who are serving out there all know <br />this, and they appreciate it. Events like this make morale go up. It's <br />just tremendous.&quot;<br /><br />The honored veterans of Iraq, Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina agreed. <br />&quot;It's important because it boosts the morale of the troops (on the <br />front lines),&quot; said Marine Corps 1st Sgt. Bobby Barnett, who served in <br />Fallujah, Iraq, in the summer of 2004. He also is an 18-year Marine veteran <br />of the first Gulf War.<br /><br />&quot;Sometimes,&quot; Barnett explained, &quot;when you have long days out on the <br />battlefield, especially when it's hot, you know, and some things may not <br />be going the way that you would like them to -- well, then you see the <br />support that you get from the home front, and so that keeps your morale <br />up. And morale is the main thing when it comes to mission <br />accomplishment. That's what helps you to push forward.&quot;<br /><br />Barnett said public support for the troops grows more important the <br />longer a conflict lasts. &quot;As you can see in the polls,&quot; he noted, &quot;the <br />longer that things go on, there may not be as much support for the war <br />itself.&quot; That's why it's important for &quot;servicemembers to see that they <br />have all this support behind them, from everybody that lives here in the <br />country.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I think it's very important,&quot; said Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Paul <br />Gibb. &quot;What people need to understand is that we give our lives not for <br />a purpose, but for a principle, and that principle is freedom for all. <br />... I've been blessed by (my military service).&quot;<br /><br />In addition to Barnett, recently deployed veterans from the other four <br />military services also were honored:<br /><br />Army Staff Sgt. Jody Belzer served with the 21st Military Police <br />Company (Airborne) in Baghdad and Fallujah from January to December 2004. He <br />earned the Army Commendation Medal for valor when he and his squad <br />defeated enemy ambushes on two consecutive nights in Fallujah. A Bronze <br />Star for service, Belzer said, was awarded to him for a wide array of <br />efforts, including convoy security operations, nighttime patrols, and <br />finding roadside bombs.<br /><br />Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Robert Medrano, a hospital corpsman, <br />provided medical assistance to troops in the Middle East while supporting <br />Operation Iraqi Freedom.<br /><br />Air Force Senior Airman Joseph G. Buzanowski, a public affairs <br />specialist, deployed in 2004 to the Combined Air Operations Center in Southwest <br />Asia to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; he will deploy to <br />Afghanistan in September.<br /><br />Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Seth Cockram served on an 87-foot patrol <br />boat off the coast of Gulfport, Miss., in support of relief operations <br />after Hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />Barnett expressed optimism about the prospects for success in Iraq. <br />&quot;Actually, everything is winnable over there,&quot; Barnett said. &quot;There is a <br />huge amount of success, and that's what a lot of people don't see. ... <br />In leaps and bounds, we're having success over there, but the things <br />that hit the news are the bad news stories, not the good news stories.&quot;<br /><br />Belzer agreed. &quot;I think it's getting better and better every day,&quot; he <br />said. &quot;When we first got over there in '04, we weren't sure. ... But <br />more often than not, what you don't see is that you drive around and not a <br />lot goes on as far as violence and stuff like that. You see a lot of <br />school kids and people running around enjoying their freedom. They're <br />showing improvements every day.&quot;<br /><br />As the veterans left the stadium, several fans stopped to thank them <br />for their service. Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, many of <br />these fans had familial ties to the U.S. military.<br /><br />&quot;We're very proud to be Americans,&quot; said Tony Caruso from Annapolis, <br />Md. Caruso was at the game with his two daughters, 5 and 7 years old, and <br />uncle, Wade W. Ridgely. Ridgely is originally from Annapolis, but is <br />now a Navy civilian employee at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia.<br /><br />&quot;We can't do enough to appreciate what our military does for us,&quot; he <br />said. &quot;We have a great country, and these men and women are on our front, <br />and they're protecting us every day. And we need to appreciate our <br />freedom -- and we do.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;They're protecting our rights and our liberties,&quot; said Allen Oaks from <br />Chicago. He said he and his girlfriend, Tara, were at the game because <br />they're baseball fans; they didn't realize it was military appreciation <br />day. However, Oaks noted, &quot;I have uncles that served in Iwo Jima and <br />Vietnam, and an uncle that served in Desert Storm. Another uncle works <br />for the Department of Homeland Security.&quot;<br /><br />Washington resident Evey Pinkham's father is a retired Air Force master <br />sergeant who fought in World War II and Korea. The retired veteran <br />served more than 40 years and lives now in a soldiers' home. Though she and <br />her family also didn't realize it was military appreciation day, they <br />were glad to be in attendance at yesterday's event. &quot;We love baseball, <br />but this just makes it more worthwhile,&quot; she said.<br /><br />&quot;I think whatever we can do (to support the troops) is great; and the <br />more we can do the better,&quot; said Washington resident Abe Frank. &quot;This is <br />just a very small thing to do for what they're doing overseas; and <br />something should be done on a regular basis.&quot;<br /><br />Especially at a time of war, &quot;it's important to remember, whatever your <br />politics, to support the troops,&quot; said the Nationals' Golden, &quot;because <br />they're really brave men and women and they're doing something that is <br />important and necessary and selfless. And I think it's an important <br />message to send across the country: that they're really heroes.&quot;<br /><br />

This date is now observed as Flag Day throughout America.</p><p>The flag was first flown from Fort Stanwix, on the site of the present city of Rome, New York, on August 3, 1777. It was first under fire for three days later in the Battle of Oriskany, August 6, 1777.</p><p>It was first decreed that there should be a star and a stripe for each state, making thirteen of both; for the states at the time had just been erected from the original thirteen colonies.</p><p>The colors of the Flag may be thus explained: The red is for valor, zeal and fervency; the white for hope purity, cleanliness of life, and rectitude of conduct; the blue, the color of heaven, for reverence to God, loyalty, sincerity, justice and truth.</p><p>The star (an ancient symbol of India, Persia and Egypt) symbolized dominion and sovereignty, as well as lofty aspirations. The constellation of the stars within the union, one star for each state, is emblematic of our Federal Constitution, which reserves to the States their individual sovereignty except as to rights delegated by them to the Federal Government.</p><p>The symbolism of the Flag was thus interpreted by Washington: &quot;We take the stars from Heaven, the red from our mother country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing Liberty.&quot;</p><p>In 1791, Vermont, and in 1792, Kentucky were admitted to the Union and the number of stars and stripes was raised to fifteen in correspondence. As other states came into the Union it became evident there would be too many stripes. So in 1818 Congress enacted that the number of stripes be reduced and restricted henceforth to thirteen representing the thirteen original states; while a star should be added for each succeeding state. That law is the law of today.</p><p>The name &quot;Old Glory&quot; was given to our National Flag August 10, 1831, by Captain William Driver of the brig Charles Doggett.</p><p>The Flag was first carried in battle at the Brandywine, September 11, 1777. It first flew over foreign territory January 28, 1778, at Nassau, Bahama Islands; Fort Nassau having been captured by the American in the course of the war for independence. The first foreign salute to the flag was rendered by the french admiral LaMotte Piquet, off Quiberon Bay, February 13, 1778.</p><p>The United States Flag is unique in the deep and noble significance of its message to the entire world, a message of national independence, of individual liberty, of idealism, of patriotism.</p><p>It symbolizes national independence and popular sovereignty. It is not the Flag of a reigning family or royal house, but of 205 million free people welded into a Nation, one and inseparable, united not only by community of interest, but by vital unity of sentiment and purpose; a Nation distinguished for the clear individual conception of its citizens alike of their duties and their privileges, their obligations and their rights.</p><p>It incarnates for all mankind the spirit of Liberty and the glorious ideal of human Freedom; not the freedom of unrestraint or the liberty of license, but an unique ideal of equal opportunity for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, safeguarded by the stern and lofty principles of duty, of righteousness and of justice, and attainable by obedience to self-imposed laws.</p><p>Floating from lofty pinnacle of American Idealism, it is a beacon of enduring hope, like the famous Bartholdi Statue of Liberty enlightening the World to the oppressed of all lands. It floats over a wondrous assemblage of people from every racial stock of the earth whose united hearts constitute an indivisible and invincible force for the defense and succor of the downtrodden.</p><p>It embodies the essence of patriotism. Its spirit is the spirit of the American nation. Its history is the history of the American people. Emblazoned upon its folds in letters of living light are the names and fame of our heroic dead, the Fathers of the Republic who devoted upon its altars their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor. Twice told tales of National honor and glory cluster thickly about it. Ever victorious, it has emerged triumphant from eight great National conflicts. It flew at Saratog, at Yorktown, at Palo Alto, at Gettysburg, at Minala bay, at Chateau-Thierry, at Iwo Jima. It bears witness to the immense expansion of our national boundaries, the development of our natural resources, and the splendid structure of our civilization. It prophesies the triumph of popular government, of civic and religious liberty and of national righteousness throughout the world.</p><p>The flag first rose over thirteen states along the Atlantic seaboard, with a population of some three million people. Today it flies over fifty states, extending across the continent, and over great islands of the two oceans; and two hundred and five million owe it allegiance. It has been brought to this proud position by love and sacrifice. Citizens have advanced it and heroes have died for it. It is the sign made visible of the strong spirit that has brought liberty and prosperity to the people of America. It is the flag of all us alike. Let us accord it honor and loyalty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img height="66" src="http://montebubbles.net/Flyers/50_stars.bmp" width="125" align="left" border="0" /></p>

Major George Armistead, the stronghold's commander, was ready to defend the fort, but he wanted a flag that would identify his position, and one whose size would be visible to the enemy from a distance. Determined to supply such a flag, a committee of high-ranking officers called on Mary Young Pickersgill, a Baltimore widow who had had experience making ship flags, and explained that they wanted a United States flag that measured 30 feet by 42 feet. She agreed to the job. <p>With the help of her 13-year-old daughter, Caroline, Mrs. Pickersgill spent several weeks measuring, cutting, and sewing the 15 stars and stripes. When the time came to sew the elements of the flag together, they realized that their house was not large enough. Mrs. Pickersgill thus asked the owner of nearby Claggett's brewery for permission to assemble the flag on the building's floor during evening hours. He agreed, and the women worked by candlelight to finish it. Once completed, the flag was delivered to the committee, and Mrs. Pickersgill was paid $405.90. In August 1813, it was presented to Major Armistead, but, as things turned out, more than a year would pass before hostile forces threatened Baltimore. </p><p>After capturing Washington, D.C., and burning some of its public buildings, the British headed for Baltimore. On the morning of September 13, 1814, British bomb ships began hurling high-trajectory shells toward Fort McHenry from positions beyond the reach of the fort's guns. The bombardment continued throughout the rainy night. </p><p>Anxiously awaiting news of the battle's outcome was a Washington, D.C., lawyer named Francis Scott Key. Key had visited the enemy's fleet to secure the release of a Maryland doctor, who had been abducted by the British after they left Washington. The lawyer had been successful in his mission, but he could not escort the doctor home until the attack ended. So he waited on a flag-of-truce sloop anchored eight miles downstream from Fort McHenry. </p><p>During the night, there had been only occasional sounds of the fort's guns returning fire. At dawn, the British bombardment tapered off. Had the fort been captured? Placing a telescope to his eye, Key trained it on the fort's flagpole. There he saw the large garrison flag catch the morning breeze. It had been raised as a gesture of defiance, replacing the wet storm flag that had flown through the night. </p><p>Thrilled by the sight of the flag and the knowledge that the fort had not fallen, Key took a letter from his pocket, and began to write some verses on the back of it. Later, after the British fleet had withdrawn, Key checked into a Baltimore hotel, and completed his poem on the defense of Fort McHenry. He then sent it to a printer for duplication on handbills, and within a few days the poem was put to the music of an old English song. Both the new song and the flag became known as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>For his leadership in defending the fort, Armistead was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel and acquired the garrison flag sometime before his death in 1818. A few weeks after the battle, he had granted the wishes of a soldier's widow for a piece of the flag to bury with her husband. In succeeding years, he cut off additional pieces to gratify the similar wishes of others; the flag itself was seen only on rare occasions. </p><p>When Commodore George H. Preble, U.S. Navy, was preparing a history of the American flag, he borrowed the Star-Spangled Banner from a descendant of Colonel Armistead, and, in 1873, photographed it for the first time. In preparation for that event, a canvas backing was attached to it; soon thereafter, it was put in storage until the Smithsonian borrowed it and placed it on exhibit in 1907. </p><p>The flag had become a popular attraction; in 1912, the owner, Eben Appleton, of New York, believing that the flag should be kept in the National Museum, donated it to the Smithsonian on the condition that it would remain there forever. Once in its possession, the Smithsonian hired an expert flag restorer to remove the old backing and sew on a new one to prevent damage during display. </p><p>The Star-Spangled Banner remained in the Arts and Industries Building (the old National Museum) as the new National Museum was constructed across the Mall. In 1964, when the Museum of American History opened, the flag was moved to a prominent place inside the museum's Mall entrance, an awe-inspiring testament to our nation's independence. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><table align="center" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><p align="left"><strong>Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light, <br />What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming? <br />Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight, <br />O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming? <br />And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, <br />Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there. <br />O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave <br />O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br /><br />On the shore dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep, <br />Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, <br />What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, <br />As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? <br /><br />Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, <br />In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream: <br />'T is the star-spangled banner: O, long may it wave <br />O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! <br /></strong></p></td><td align="center"><p align="left">&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p align="left"><strong>And where is that band who so vauntingly swore <br />That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion <br />A home and a country should leave us no more? <br />Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution. <br />No refuge could save the hireling and slave <br />From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave: <br />And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave <br />O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. <br /><br />O, thus be it ever when freemen shall stand, <br />Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation; <br />Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land <br />Praise the Pow'r that hath made and preserv'd us as a nation! <br />Then conquer we must, when our cause is just, <br />And this be our motto: &quot;In God is our trust&quot; <br />And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave <br />O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! </strong></p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

                              <h5>Why did yankee doodle stick a feather in his hat and call it macaroni? Back in Pre-Revolutionary America when the song &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; was first popular, the singer was not referring to the pasta &quot;macaroni&quot; in the line that reads &quot;stuck a feather in his hat and called it macaroni&quot;. &quot;Macaroni&quot; was a fancy (&quot;dandy&quot;) style of Italian dress widely imitated in England at the time. So by just sticking a feather in his cap and calling himself a &quot;Macaroni&quot; (a &quot;dandy&quot;), Yankee Doodle was proudly proclaiming himself to be a country bumpkin, because that was how the English regarded most colonials at that time. But times have long since changed, and it is important to reflect on the fact that despite the turbulent early relationship between England and the American colonists, our two countries are strongly united. </h5><p>Yankee Doodle went to town<br />A-riding on a pony<br />Stuck a feather in his hat<br />And called it macaroni.<br /><br />Yankee Doodle, keep it up<br />Yankee Doodle dandy<br />Mind the music and the step<br />And with the girls be handy.<br /><br />Father and I went down to camp<br />Along with Captain Gooding<br />And there we saw the men and boys<br />As thick as hasty pudding.<br /><br />Yankee Doodle, keep it up<br />Yankee Doodle dandy<br />Mind the music and the step<br />And with the girls be handy<br /><br />There was Captain Washington<br />Upon a slapping stallion<br />A-giving orders to his men<br />I guess there was a million.<br /><br />Yankee Doodle, keep it up<br />Yankee Doodle dandy<br />Mind the music and the step<br />And with the girls be handy.</p>

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nations come into being in many ways. Military rebellion, civil strife, acts of heroism, acts of treachery, a thousand greater and lesser clashes between defenders of the old order and supporters of the new--all these occurrences and more have marked the emergences of new nations, large and small. The birth of our own nation included them all. That birth was unique, not only in the immensity of its later impact on the course of world history and the growth of democracy, but also because so many of the threads in our national history run back through time to come together in one place, in one time, and in one document: the Declaration of Independence.</p><strong><p>Moving Toward Independence</p></strong><p>The clearest call for independence up to the summer of 1776 came in Philadelphia on June 7. On that date in session in the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall), the Continental Congress heard Richard Henry Lee of Virginia read his resolution beginning: &quot;Resolved: That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.&quot;</p><p>The Lee Resolution was an expression of what was already beginning to happen throughout the colonies. When the Second Continental Congress, which was essentially the government of the United States from 1775 to 1788, first met in May 1775, King George III had not replied to the petition for redress of grievances that he had been sent by the First Continental Congress. The Congress gradually took on the responsibilities of a national government. In June 1775 the Congress established the Continental Army as well as a continental currency. By the end of July of that year, it created a post office for the &quot;United Colonies.&quot;</p><p>In August 1775 a royal proclamation declared that the King's American subjects were &quot;engaged in open and avowed rebellion.&quot; Later that year, Parliament passed the American Prohibitory Act, which made all American vessels and cargoes forfeit to the Crown. And in May 1776 the Congress learned that the King had negotiated treaties with German states to hire mercenaries to fight in America. The weight of these actions combined to convince many Americans that the mother country was treating the colonies as a foreign entity.</p><p>One by one, the Continental Congress continued to cut the colonies' ties to Britain. The Privateering Resolution, passed in March 1776, allowed the colonists &quot;to fit out armed vessels to cruize [sic] on the enemies of these United Colonies.&quot; On April 6, 1776, American ports were opened to commerce with other nations, an action that severed the economic ties fostered by the Navigation Acts. A &quot;Resolution for the Formation of Local Governments&quot; was passed on May 10, 1776.</p><p>At the same time, more of the colonists themselves were becoming convinced of the inevitability of independence. Thomas Paine's Common Sense, published in January 1776, was sold by the thousands. By the middle of May 1776, eight colonies had decided that they would support independence. On May 15, 1776, the Virginia Convention passed a resolution that &quot;the delegates appointed to represent this colony in General Congress be instructed to propose to that respectable body to declare the United Colonies free and independent states.&quot;</p><p>It was in keeping with these instructions that Richard Henry Lee, on June 7, 1776, presented his resolution. There were still some delegates, however, including those bound by earlier instructions, who wished to pursue the path of reconciliation with Britain. On June 11 consideration of the Lee Resolution was postponed by a vote of seven colonies to five, with New York abstaining. Congress then recessed for 3 weeks. The tone of the debate indicated that at the end of that time the Lee Resolution would be adopted. Before Congress recessed, therefore, a Committee of Five was appointed to draft a statement presenting to the world the colonies' case for independence.</p><strong><p>The Committee of Five</p></strong><p>The committee consisted of two New England men, John Adams of Massachusetts and Roger Sherman of Connecticut; two men from the Middle Colonies, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania and Robert R. Livingston of New York; and one southerner, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. In 1823 Jefferson wrote that the other members of the committee &quot;unanimously pressed on myself alone to undertake the draught [sic]. I consented; I drew it; but before I reported it to the committee I communicated it separately to Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams requesting their corrections. . . I then wrote a fair copy, reported it to the committee, and from them, unaltered to the Congress.&quot; (If Jefferson did make a &quot;fair copy,&quot; incorporating the changes made by Franklin and Adams, it has not been preserved. It may have been the copy that was amended by the Congress and used for printing, but in any case, it has not survived. Jefferson's rough draft, however, with changes made by Franklin and Adams, as well as Jefferson's own notes of changes by the Congress, is housed at the Library of Congress.)</p><p>Jefferson's account reflects three stages in the life of the Declaration: the document originally written by Jefferson; the changes to that document made by Franklin and Adams, resulting in the version that was submitted by the Committee of Five to the Congress; and the version that was eventually adopted.</p><p>On July 1, 1776, Congress reconvened. The following day, the Lee Resolution for independence was adopted by 12 of the 13 colonies, New York not voting. Immediately afterward, the Congress began to consider the Declaration. Adams and Franklin had made only a few changes before the committee submitted the document. The discussion in Congress resulted in some alterations and deletions, but the basic document remained Jefferson's. The process of revision continued through all of July 3 and into the late morning of July 4. Then, at last, church bells rang out over Philadelphia; the Declaration had been officially adopted.</p><p>The Declaration of Independence is made up of five distinct parts: the introduction; the preamble; the body, which can be divided into two sections; and a conclusion. The introduction states that this document will &quot;declare&quot; the &quot;causes&quot; that have made it necessary for the American colonies to leave the British Empire. Having stated in the introduction that independence is unavoidable, even necessary, the preamble sets out principles that were already recognized to be &quot;self-evident&quot; by most 18th- century Englishmen, closing with the statement that &quot;a long train of abuses and usurpations . . . evinces a design to reduce [a people] under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.&quot; The first section of the body of the Declaration gives evidence of the &quot;long train of abuses and usurpations&quot; heaped upon the colonists by King George III. The second section of the body states that the colonists had appealed in vain to their &quot;British brethren&quot; for a redress of their grievances. Having stated the conditions that made independence necessary and having shown that those conditions existed in British North America, the Declaration concludes that &quot;these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved.&quot;</p><p>Although Congress had adopted the Declaration submitted by the Committee of Five, the committee's task was not yet completed. Congress had also directed that the committee supervise the printing of the adopted document. The first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence were turned out from the shop of John Dunlap, official printer to the Congress. After the Declaration had been adopted, the committee took to Dunlap the manuscript document, possibly Jefferson's &quot;fair copy&quot; of his rough draft. On the morning of July 5, copies were dispatched by members of Congress to various assemblies, conventions, and committees of safety as well as to the commanders of Continental troops. Also on July 5, a copy of the printed version of the approved Declaration was inserted into the &quot;rough journal&quot; of the Continental Congress for July 4. The text was followed by the words &quot;Signed by Order and in Behalf of the Congress, John Hancock, President. Attest. Charles Thomson, Secretary.&quot; It is not known how many copies John Dunlap printed on his busy night of July 4. There are 24 copies known to exist of what is commonly referred to as &quot;the Dunlap broadside,&quot; 17 owned by American institutions, 2 by British institutions, and 5 by private owners. (See Appendix A.)</p><strong><p>The Engrossed Declaration</p></strong><p>On July 9 the action of Congress was officially approved by the New York Convention. All 13 colonies had now signified their approval. On July 19, therefore, Congress was able to order that the Declaration be &quot;fairly engrossed on parchment, with the title and stile [sic] of 'The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America,' and that the same, when engrossed, be signed by every member of Congress.&quot;</p><p>Engrossing is the process of preparing an official document in a large, clear hand. Timothy Matlack was probably the engrosser of the Declaration. He was a Pennsylvanian who had assisted the Secretary of the Congress, Charles Thomson, in his duties for over a year and who had written out George Washington's commission as commanding general of the ContinentalArmy. Matlack set to work with pen, ink, parchment, and practiced hand, and finally, on August 2, the journal of the Continental Congress records that &quot;The declaration of independence being engrossed and compared at the table was signed.&quot; One of the most widely held misconceptions about the Declaration is that it was signed on July 4, 1776, by all the delegates in attendance.</p><p>John Hancock, the President of the Congress, was the first to sign the sheet of parchment measuring 24&frac14; by 29&frac34; inches. He used a bold signature centered below the text. In accordance with prevailing custom, the other delegates began to sign at the right below the text, their signatures arranged according to the geographic location of the states they represented. New Hampshire, the northernmost state, began the list, and Georgia, the southernmost, ended it. Eventually 56 delegates signed, although all were not present on August 2. Among the later signers were Elbridge Gerry, Oliver Wolcott, Lewis Morris, Thomas McKean, and Matthew Thornton, who found that he had no room to sign with the other New Hampshire delegates. A few delegates who voted for adoption of the Declaration on July 4 were never to sign in spite of the July 19 order of Congress that the engrossed document &quot;be signed by every member of Congress.&quot; Nonsigners included John Dickinson, who clung to the idea of reconciliation with Britain, and Robert R. Livingston, one of the Committee of Five, who thought the Declaration was premature.</p><strong><p>Parchment and Ink</p></strong><p>Over the next 200 years, the nation whose birth was announced with a Declaration &quot;fairly engrossed on parchment&quot; was to show immense growth in area, population, economic power, and social complexity and a lasting commitment to a testing and strengthening of its democracy. But what of the parchment itself? How was it to fare over the course of two centuries?</p><p>In the chronicle of the Declaration as a physical object, three themes necessarily entwine themselves: the relationship between the physical aging of the parchment and the steps taken to preserve it from deterioration; the relationship between the parchment and the copies that were made from it; and finally, the often dramatic story of the travels of the parchment during wartime and to its various homes.</p><p>Chronologically, it is helpful to divide the history of the Declaration after its signing into five main periods, some more distinct than others. The first period consists of the early travels of the parchment and lasts until 1814. The second period relates to the long sojourn of the Declaration in Washington, DC, from 1814 until its brief return to Philadelphia for the 1876 Centennial. The third period covers the years 1877-1921, a period marked by increasing concern for the deterioration of the document and the need for a fitting and permanent Washington home. Except for an interlude during World War II, the fourth and fifth periods cover the time the Declaration rested in the Library of Congress from 1921 to 1952 and in the National Archives from 1952 to the present.</p><strong><p>Early Travels, 1776-1814</p></strong><p>Once the Declaration was signed, the document probably accompanied the Continental Congress as that body traveled during the uncertain months and years of the Revolution. Initially, like other parchment documents of the time, the Declaration was probably stored in a rolled format. Each time the document was used, it would have been unrolled and re-rolled. This action, as well as holding the curled parchment flat, doubtless took its toll on the ink and on the parchment surface through abrasion and flexing. The acidity inherent in the iron gall ink used by Timothy Matlack allowed the ink to &quot;bite&quot; into the surface of the parchment, thus contributing to the ink's longevity, but the rolling and unrolling of the parchment still presented many hazards.</p><p>After the signing ceremony on August 2, 1776, the Declaration was most likely filed in Philadelphia in the office of Charles Thomson, who served as the Secretary of the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1789. On December 12, threatened by the British, Congress adjourned and reconvened 8 days later in Baltimore, MD. A light wagon carried the Declaration to its new home, where it remained until its return to Philadelphia in March of 1777.</p><p>On January 18, 1777, while the Declaration was still in Baltimore, Congress, bolstered by military successes at Trenton and Princeton, ordered the second official printing of the document. The July 4 printing had included only the names of John Hancock and Charles Thomson, and even though the first printing had been promptly circulated to the states, the names of subsequent signers were kept secret for a time because of fear of British reprisals. By its order of January 18, however, Congress required that &quot;an authentic copy of the Declaration of Independency, with the names of the members of Congress subscribing to the same, be sent to each of the United States, and that they be desired to have the same put upon record.&quot; The &quot;authentic copy&quot; was duly printed, complete with signers' names, by Mary Katherine Goddard in Baltimore.</p><p>Assuming that the Declaration moved with the Congress, it would have been back in Philadelphia from March to September 1777. On September 27, it would have moved to Lancaster, PA, for 1 day only. From September 30, 1777, through June 1778, the Declaration would have been kept in the courthouse at York, PA. From July 1778 to June 1783, it would have had a long stay back in Philadelphia. In 1783, it would have been at Princeton, NJ, from June to November, and then, after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the Declaration would have been moved to Annapolis, MD, where it stayed until October 1784. For the months of November and December 1784, it would have been at Trenton, NJ. Then in 1785, when Congress met in New York, the Declaration was housed in the old New York City Hall, where it probably remained until 1790 (although when Pierre L'Enfant was remodeling the building for the convening of the First Federal Congress, it might have been temporarily removed). </p><p>In July 1789 the First Congress under the new Constitution created the Department of Foreign Affairs and directed that its Secretary should have &quot;the custody and charge of all records, books and papers&quot; kept by the department of the same name under the old government. On July 24 Charles Thomson retired as Secretary of the Congress and, upon the order of President George Washington, surrendered the Declaration to Roger Alden, Deputy Secretary of Foreign Affairs. In September 1789 the name of the department was changed to the Department of State. Thomas Jefferson, the drafter of the Declaration, returned from France to assume his duties as the first Secretary of State in March of 1790. Appropriately, those duties now included custody of the Declaration.</p><p>In July 1790 Congress provided for a permanent capital to be built among the woodlands and swamps bordering the Potomac River. Meanwhile, the temporary seat of government was to return to Philadelphia. Congress also provided that &quot;prior to the first Monday in December next, all offices attached to the seat of the government of the United States&quot; should be removed to Philadelphia. The Declaration was therefore back in Philadelphia by the close of 1790. It was housed in various buildings--on Market Street, at Arch and Sixth, and at Fifth and Chestnut.</p><p>In 1800, by direction of President John Adams, the Declaration and other government records were moved from Philadelphia to the new federal capital now rising in the District of Columbia. To reach its new home, the Declaration traveled down the Delaware River and Bay, out into the ocean, into the Chesapeake Bay, and up the Potomac to Washington, completing its longest water journey.</p><p>For about 2 months the Declaration was housed in buildings built for the use of the Treasury Department. For the next year it was housed in one of the &quot;Seven Buildings&quot; then standing at Nineteenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Its third home before 1814 was in the old War Office Building on Seventeenth Street.</p><p>In August 1814, the United States being again at war with Great Britain, a British fleet appeared in the Chesapeake Bay. Secretary of State James Monroe rode out to observe the landing of British forces along the Patuxent River in Maryland. A message from Monroe alerted State Department officials, in particular a clerk named Stephen Pleasonton, of the imminent threat to the capital city and, of course, the government's official records. Pleasonton &quot;proceeded to purchase coarse linen, and cause it to be made into bags of convenient size, in which the gentlemen of the office&quot; packed the precious books and records including the Declaration.</p><p>A cartload of records was then taken up the Potomac River to an unused gristmill belonging to Edgar Patterson. The structure was located on the Virginia side of the Potomac, about 2 miles upstream from Georgetown. Here the Declaration and the other records remained, probably overnight. Pleasonton, meanwhile, asked neighboring farmers for the use of their wagons. On August 24, the day of the British attack on Washington, the Declaration was on its way to Leesburg, VA. That evening, while the White House and other government buildings were burning, the Declaration was stored 35 miles away at Leesburg.</p><p>The Declaration remained safe at a private home in Leesburg for an interval of several weeks--in fact, until the British had withdrawn their troops from Washington and their fleet from the Chesapeake Bay. In September 1814 the Declaration was returned to the national capital. With the exception of a trip to Philadelphia for the Centennial and to Fort Knox during World War II, it has remained there ever since.</p><strong><p>Washington, 1814-76</p></strong><p>The Declaration remained in Washington from September 1814 to May 1841. It was housed in four locations. From 1814 to 1841, it was kept in three different locations as the State Department records were shifted about the growing city. The last of these locations was a brick building that, it was later observed, &quot;offered no security against fire.&quot;</p><p>One factor that had no small effect on the physical condition of the Declaration was recognized as interest in reproductions of the Declaration increased as the nation grew. Two early facsimile printings of the Declaration were made during the second decade of the 19th century: those of Benjamin Owen Tyler (1818) and John Binns (1819). Both facsimiles used decorative and ornamental elements to enhance the text of the Declaration. Richard Rush, who was Acting Secretary of State in 1817, remarked on September 10 of that year about the Tyler copy: &quot;The foregoing copy of the Declaration of Independence has been collated with the original instrument and found correct. I have myself examined the signatures to each. Those executed by Mr. Tyler, are curiously exact imitations, so much so, that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the closest scrutiny to distinguish them, were it not for the hand of time, from the originals.&quot; Rush's reference to &quot;the hand of time&quot; suggests that the signatures were already fading in 1817, only 40 years after they were first affixed to the parchment.</p><p>One later theory as to why the Declaration was aging so soon after its creation stems from the common 18th-century practice of taking &quot;press copies.&quot; Press copies were made by placing a damp sheet of thin paper on a manuscript and pressing it until a portion of the ink was transferred. The thin paper copy was retained in the same manner as a modern carbon copy. The ink was reimposed on a copper plate, which was then etched so that copies could be run off the plate on a press. This &quot;wet transfer&quot; method may have been used by William J. Stone when in 1820 he was commissioned by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams to make a facsimile of the entire Declaration, signatures as well as text. By June 5, 1823, almost exactly 47 years after Jefferson's first draft of the Declaration, the (Washington) National Intelligencer was able to report &quot;that Mr. William J. Stone, a respectable and enterprising Engraver of this City, has, after a labor of three years, completed a fac simile of the original of the Declaration of Independence, now in the archives of the government; that it is executed with the greatest exactness and fidelity; and that the Department of State has become the purchaser of the plate.&quot;</p><p>As the Intelligencer went on to observe: &quot;We are very glad to hear this, for the original of that paper which ought to be immortal and imperishable, by being so much handled by copyists and curious visitors, might receive serious injury. The facility of multiplying copies of it now possessed by the Department of State will render further exposure of the original unnecessary.&quot; The language of the newspaper report, like that of Rush's earlier comment, would seem to indicate some fear of the deterioration of the Declaration even prior to Stone's work.</p><p>The copies made from Stone's copperplate established the clear visual image of the Declaration for generations of Americans. The 200 official parchment copies struck from the Stone plate carry the identification &quot;Engraved by W. J. Stone for the Department of State, by order&quot; in the upper left corner followed by &quot;of J. Q. Adams, Sec. of State July 4th 1823.&quot; in the upper right corner. &quot;Unofficial&quot; copies that were struck later do not have the identification at the top of the document. Instead the engraver identified his work by engraving &quot;W. J. Stone SC. Washn.&quot; near the lower left corner and burnishing out the earlier identification.</p><p>The longest of the early sojourns of the Declaration was from 1841 to 1876. Daniel Webster was Secretary of State in 1841. On June 11 he wrote to Commissioner of Patents Henry L. Ellsworth, who was then occupying a new building (now the National Portrait Gallery), that &quot;having learned that there is in the new building appropriated to the Patent Office suitable accommodations for the safe-keeping, as well as the exhibition of the various articles now deposited in this Department, and usually, exhibited to visitors . . . I have directed them to be transmitted to you.&quot; An inventory accompanied the letter. Item 6 was the Declaration.</p><p>The &quot;new building&quot; was a white stone structure at Seventh and F Streets. The Declaration and Washington's commission as commander in chief were mounted together in a single frame and hung in a white painted hall opposite a window offering exposure to sunlight. There they were to remain on exhibit for 35 years, even after the Patent Office separated from the State Department to become administratively a part of the Interior Department. This prolonged exposure to sunlight accelerated the deterioration of the ink and parchment of the Declaration, which was approaching 100 years of age toward the end of this period.</p><p>During the years that the Declaration was exhibited in the Patent Office, the combined effects of aging, sunlight, and fluctuating temperature and relative humidity took their toll on the document. Occasionally, writers made somewhat negative comments on the appearance of the Declaration. An observer in the United States Magazine (October 1856) went so far as to refer to &quot;that old looking paper with the fading ink.&quot; John B. Ellis remarked in The Sights and Secrets of the National Capital (Chicago, 1869) that &quot;it is old and yellow, and the ink is fading from the paper.&quot; An anonymous writer in the Historical Magazine (October 1870) wrote: &quot;The original manuscript of the Declaration of Independence and of Washington's Commission, now in the United States Patent Office at Washington, D.C., are said to be rapidly fading out so that in a few years, only the naked parchment will remain. Already, nearly all the signatures attached to the Declaration of Independence are entirely effaced.&quot; In May 1873 the Historical Magazine published an official statement by Mortimer Dormer Leggett, Commissioner of Patents, who admitted that &quot;many of the names to the Declaration are already illegible.&quot;</p><p>The technology of a new age and the interest in historical roots engendered by the approaching Centennial focused new interest on the Declaration in the 1870s and brought about a brief change of home.</p><strong><p>The Centennial and the Debate Over Preservation, 1876-1921</p></strong><p>In 1876 the Declaration traveled to Philadelphia, where it was on exhibit for the Centennial National Exposition from May to October. Philadelphia's Mayor William S. Stokley was entrusted by President Ulysses S. Grant with temporary custody of the Declaration. The Public Ledger for May 8, 1876, noted that it was in Independence Hall &quot;framed and glazed for protection, and . . . deposited in a fireproof safe especially designed for both preservation and convenient display. [When the outer doors of the safe were opened, the parchment was visible behind a heavy plate-glass inner door; the doors were closed at night.] Its aspect is of course faded and time-worn. The text is fully legible, but the major part of the signatures are so pale as to be only dimly discernible in the strongest light, a few remain wholly readable, and some are wholly invisible, the spaces which contained them presenting only a blank.&quot;</p><p>Other descriptions made at Philadelphia were equally unflattering: &quot;scarce bears trace of the signatures the execution of which made fifty-six names imperishable,&quot; &quot;aged-dimmed.&quot; But on the Fourth of July, after the text was read aloud to a throng on Independence Square by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia (grandson of the signer Richard Henry Lee), &quot;The faded and crumbling manuscript, held together by a simple frame was then exhibited to the crowd and was greeted with cheer after cheer.&quot;</p><p>By late summer the Declaration's physical condition had become a matter of public concern. On August 3, 1876, Congress adopted a joint resolution providing &quot;that a commission, consisting of the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and the Librarian of Congress be empowered to have resort to such means as will most effectually restore the writing of the original manuscript of the Declaration of Independence, with the signatures appended thereto.&quot; This resolution had actually been introduced as early as January 5, 1876. One candidate for the task of restoration was William J. Canby, an employee of the Washington Gas Light Company. On April 13 Canby had written to the Librarian of Congress: &quot;I have had over thirty years experience in handling the pen upon parchment and in that time, as an expert, have engrossed hundreds of ornamental, special documents.&quot; Canby went on to suggest that &quot;the only feasible plan is to replenish the original with a supply of ink, which has been destroyed by the action of light and time, with an ink well known to be, for all practical purposes, imperishable.&quot;</p><p>The commission did not, however, take any action at that time. After the conclusion of the Centennial exposition, attempts were made to secure possession of the Declaration for Philadelphia, but these failed and the parchment was returned to the Patent Office in Washington, where it had been since 1841, even though that office had become a part of the Interior Department. On April 11, 1876, Robert H. Duell, Commissioner of Patents, had written to Zachariah Chandler, Secretary of the Interior, suggesting that &quot;the Declaration of Independence, and the commission of General Washington, associated with it in the same frame, belong to your Department as heirlooms.</p><p>Chandler appears to have ignored this claim, for in an exchange of letters with Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, it was agreed-with the approval of President Grant-to move the Declaration into the new, fireproof building that the State Department shared with the War and Navy Departments (now the Old Executive Office Building).</p><p>On March 3, 1877, the Declaration was placed in a cabinet on the eastern side of the State Department library, where it was to be exhibited for 17 years. It may be noted that not only was smoking permitted in the library, but the room contained an open fireplace. Nevertheless this location turned out to be safer than the premises just vacated; much of the Patent Office was gutted in a fire that occurred a few months later.</p><p>On May 5, 1880, the commission that had been appointed almost 4 years earlier came to life again in response to a call from the Secretary of the Interior. It requested that William B. Rogers, president of the National Academy of Sciences appoint a committee of experts to consider &quot;whether such restoration [of the Declaration] be expedient or practicable and if so in what way the object can best be accomplished.&quot;</p><p>The duly appointed committee reported on January 7, 1881, that Stone used the &quot;wet transfer&quot; method in the creation of his facsimile printing of 1823, that the process had probably removed some of the original ink, and that chemical restoration methods were &quot;at best imperfect and uncertain in their results.&quot; The committee concluded, therefore, that &quot;it is not expedient to attempt to restore the manuscript by chemical means.&quot; The group of experts then recommended that &quot;it will be best either to cover the present receptacle of the manuscript with an opaque lid or to remove the manuscript from its frame and place it in a portfolio, where it may be protected from the action of light.&quot; Finally, the committee recommended that &quot;no press copies of any part of it should in future be permitted.&quot;</p><p>Recent study of the Declaration by conservators at the National Archives has raised doubts that a &quot;wet transfer&quot; took place. Proof of this occurrence, however, cannot be verified or denied strictly by modern examination methods. No documentation prior to the 1881 reference has been found to support the theory; therefore we may never know if Stone actually performed the procedure.</p><p>Little, if any, action was taken as a result of the 1881 report. It was not until 1894 that the State Department announced: &quot;The rapid fading of the text of the original Declaration of Independence and the deterioration of the parchment upon which it is engrossed, from exposure to light and lapse of time, render it impracticable for the Department longer to exhibit it or to handle it. For the secure preservation of its present condition, so far as may be possible, it has been carefully wrapped and placed flat in a steel case.&quot;</p><p>A new plate for engravings was made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1895, and in 1898 a photograph was made for the Ladies' Home Journal. On this latter occasion, the parchment was noted as &quot;still in good legible condition&quot; although &quot;some of the signatures&quot; were &quot;necessarily blurred.&quot;</p><p>On April 14, 1903, Secretary of State John Hay solicited again the help of the National Academy of Sciences in providing &quot;such recommendations as may seem practicable . . . touching [the Declaration's] preservation.&quot; Hay went on to explain: &quot;It is now kept out of the light, sealed between two sheets of glass, presumably proof against air, and locked in a steel safe. I am unable to say, however, that, in spite of these precautions, observed for the past ten years, the text is not continuing to fade and the parchment to wrinkle and perhaps to break.&quot;</p><p>On April 24 a committee of the academy reported its findings. Summarizing the physical history of the Declaration, the report stated: &quot;The instrument has suffered very seriously from the very harsh treatment to which it was exposed in the early years of the Republic. Folding and rolling have creased the parchment. The wet press-copying operation to which it was exposed about 1820, for the purpose of producing a facsimile copy, removed a large portion of the ink. Subsequent exposure to the action of light for more than thirty years, while the instrument was placed on exhibition, has resulted in the fading of the ink, particularly in the signatures. The present method of caring for the instrument seems to be the best that can be suggested.&quot;</p><p>The committee added its own &quot;opinion that the present method of protecting the instrument should be continued; that it should be kept in the dark and dry as possible, and never placed on exhibition.&quot; Secretary Hay seems to have accepted the committee's recommendation; in the following year, William H. Michael, author of The Declaration of Independence (Washington, 1904), recorded that the Declaration was &quot;locked and sealed, by order of Secretary Hay, and is no longer shown to anyone except by his direction.&quot;</p><p>World War I came and went. Then, on April 21, 1920, Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby issued an order creating yet another committee: &quot;A Committee is hereby appointed to study the proper steps that should be taken for the permanent and effective preservation from deterioration and from danger from fire, or other form of destruction, of those documents of supreme value which under the law are deposited with the Secretary of State. The inquiry will include the question of display of certain of these documents for the benefit of the patriotic public.&quot;</p><p>On May 5, 1920, the new committee reported on the physical condition of the safes that housed the Declaration and the Constitution. It declared: &quot;The safes are constructed of thin sheets of steel. They are not fireproof nor would they offer much obstruction to an evil-disposed person who wished to break into them.&quot; About the physical condition of the Declaration, the committee stated: &quot;We believe the fading can go no further. We see no reason why the original document should not be exhibited if the parchment be laid between two sheets of glass, hermetically sealed at the edges and exposed only to diffused light.&quot;</p><p>The committee also made some important &quot;supplementary recommendations.&quot; It noted that on March 3, 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt had directed that certain records relating to the Continental Congress be turned over by the Department of State to the Library of Congress: &quot;This transfer was made under a provision of an Act of February 25, 1903, that any Executive Department may turn over to the Library of Congress books, maps, or other material no longer needed for the use of the Department.&quot; The committee recommended that the remaining papers, including the Declaration and the Constitution, be similarly given over to the custody of the Library of Congress. For the Declaration, therefore, two important changes were in the offing: a new home and the possibility of exhibition to &quot;the patriotic public.&quot;</p><strong><p>The Library of Congress . . . and Fort Knox, 1921-52</p></strong><p>There was no action on the recommendations of 1920 until after the Harding administration took office. On September 28, 1921, Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes addressed the new President: &quot;I enclose an executive order for your signature, if you approve, transferring to the custody of the Library of Congress the original Declaration of Independence and Constitution of the United States which are now in the custody of this Department. . . . I make this recommendation because in the Library of Congress these muniments will be in the custody of experts skilled in archival preservation, in a building of modern fireproof construction, where they can safely be exhibited to the many visitors who now desire to see them.&quot;</p><p>President Warren G. Harding agreed. On September 29, 1921, he issued the Executive order authorizing the transfer. The following day Secretary Hughes sent a copy of the order to Librarian of Congress Herbert Putnam, stating that he was &quot;prepared to turn the documents over to you when you are ready to receive them.&quot;</p><p>Putnam was both ready and eager. He presented himself forthwith at the State Department. The safes were opened, and the Declaration and the Constitution were carried off to the Library of Congress on Capitol Hill in the Library's &quot;mail wagon,&quot; cushioned by a pile of leather U.S. mail sacks. Upon arrival, the two national treasures were placed in a safe in Putnam's office.</p><p>On October 3, Putnam took up the matter of a permanent location. In a memorandum to the superintendent of the Library building and grounds, Putnam proceeded from the premise that &quot;in the Library&quot; the documents &quot;might be treated in such a way as, while fully safe-guarding them and giving them distinction, they should be open to inspection by the public at large.&quot; The memorandum discussed the need for a setting &quot;safe, dignified, adequate, and in every way suitable . . . Material less than bronze would be unworthy. The cost must be considerable.&quot;</p><p>The Librarian then requested the sum of $12,000 for his purpose. The need was urgent because the new Bureau of the Budget was about to print forthcoming fiscal year estimates. There was therefore no time to make detailed architectural plans. Putnam told an appropriations committee on January 16, 1922, just what he had in mind. &quot;There is a way . . . we could construct, say, on the second floor on the western side in that long open gallery a railed inclosure, material of bronze, where these documents, with one or two auxiliary documents leading up to them, could be placed, where they need not be touched by anybody but where a mere passer-by could see them, where they could be set in permanent bronze frames and where they could be protected from the natural light, lighted only by soft incandescent lamps. The result could be achieved and you would have something every visitor to Washington would wish to tell about when he returned and who would regard it, as the newspapermen are saying, with keen interest as a sort of 'shrine.'&quot; The Librarian's imaginative presentation was successful: The sum of $12,000 was appropriated and approved on March 20, 1922.</p><p>Before long, the &quot;sort of 'shrine'&quot; was being designed by Francis H. Bacon, whose brother Henry was the architect of the Lincoln Memorial. Materials used included different kinds of marble from New York, Vermont, Tennessee, the Greek island of Tinos, and Italy. The marbles surrounding the manuscripts were American; the floor and balustrade were made of foreign marbles to correspond with the material used in the rest of the Library. The Declaration was to be housed in a frame of gold-plated bronze doors and covered with double panes of plate glass with specially prepared gelatin films between the plates to exclude the harmful rays of light. A 24-hour guard would provide protection.</p><p>On February 28, 1924, the shrine was dedicated in the presence of President and Mrs. Calvin Coolidge, Secretary Hughes, and other distinguished guests. Not a word was spoken during a moving ceremony in which Putnam fitted the Declaration into its frame. There were no speeches. Two stanzas of America were sung. In Putnam's words: &quot;The impression on the audience proved the emotional potency of documents animate with a great tradition.&quot;</p><p>With only one interruption, the Declaration hung on the wall of the second floor of the Great Hall of the Library of Congress until December 1952. During the prosperity of the 1920s and the Depression of the 1930s, millions of people visited the shrine. But the threat of war and then war itself caused a prolonged interruption in the steady stream of visitors.</p><p>On April 30, 1941, worried that the war raging in Europe might engulf the United States, the newly appointed Librarian of Congress, Archibald MacLeish, wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau, Jr. The Librarian was concerned for the most precious of the many objects in his charge. He wrote &quot;to enquire whether space might perhaps be found&quot; at the Bullion Depository in Fort Knox for his most valuable materials, including the Declaration, &quot;in the unlikely event that it becomes necessary to remove them from Washington.&quot; Secretary Morgenthau replied that space would indeed be made available as necessary for the &quot;storage of such of the more important papers as you might designate.&quot;</p><p>On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. On December 23, the Declaration and the Constitution were removed from the shrine and placed between two sheets of acid-free manilla paper. The documents were then carefully wrapped in a container of all-rag neutral millboard and placed in a specially designed bronze container. It was late at night when the container was finally secured with padlocks on each side. Preparations were resumed on the day after Christmas, when the Attorney General ruled that the Librarian needed no &quot;further authority from the Congress or the President&quot; to take such action as he deemed necessary for the &quot;proper protection and preservation&quot; of the documents in his charge.</p><p>The packing process continued under constant armed guard. The container was finally sealed with lead and packed in a heavy box; the whole weighed some 150 pounds. It was a far cry from the simple linen bag of the summer of 1814.</p><p>At about 5 p.m. the box, along with other boxes containing vital records, was loaded into an armed and escorted truck, taken to Union Station, and loaded into a compartment of the Pullman sleeper Eastlake. Armed Secret Service agents occupied the neighboring compartments. After departing from Washington at 6:30 p.m., the Declaration traveled to Louisville, KY, arriving at 10:30 a.m., December 27, 1941. More Secret Service agents and a cavalry troop of the 13th Armored Division met the train, convoyed its precious contents to the Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, and placed the Declaration in compartment 24 in the outer tier on the ground level.</p><p>The Declaration was periodically examined during its sojourn at Fort Knox. One such examination in 1942 found that the Declaration had become detached in part from its mount, including the upper right corner, which had been stuck down with copious amounts of glue. In his journal for May 14, 1942, Verner W. Clapp, a Library of Congress official, noted: &quot;At one time also (about January 12, 1940) an attempt had been made to reunite the detached upper right hand corner to the main portion by means of a strip of 'scotch' cellulose tape which was still in place, discolored to a molasses color. In the various mending efforts glue had been splattered in two places on the obverse of the document.&quot;</p><p>The opportunity was taken to perform conservation treatment in order to stabilize and rejoin the upper right corner. Under great secrecy, George Stout and Evelyn Erlich, both of the Fogg Museum at Harvard University, traveled to Fort Knox. Over a period of 2 days, they performed mending of small tears, removed excess adhesive and the &quot;scotch&quot; tape, and rejoined the detached upper right corner.</p><p>Finally, in 1944, the military authorities assured the Library of Congress that all danger of enemy attack had passed. On September 19, the documents were withdrawn from Fort Knox. On Sunday, October 1, at 11:30 a.m., the doors of the Library were opened. The Declaration was back in its shrine. </p><p>With the return of peace, the keepers of the Declaration were mindful of the increasing technological expertise available to them relating to the preservation of the parchment. In this they were readily assisted by the National Bureau of Standards, which even before World War II, had researched the preservation of the Declaration. The problem of shielding it from harsh light, for example, had in 1924 led to the insertion of a sheet of yellow gelatin between the protective plates of glass. Yet this procedure lessened the visibility of an already faded parchment. Could not some improvement be made?</p><p>Following reports of May 5, 1949, on studies in which the Library staff, members of the National Bureau of Standards, and representatives of a glass manufacturer had participated, new recommendations were made. In 1951 the Declaration was sealed in a thermopane enclosure filled with properly humidified helium. The exhibit case was equipped with a filter to screen out damaging light. The new enclosure also had the effect of preventing harm from air pollution, a growing peril.</p><p>Soon after, however, the Declaration was to make one more move, the one to its present home. (See Appendix B.)</p><strong><p>The National Archives, 1952 to the Present</p></strong><p>In 1933, while the Depression gripped the nation, President Hoover laid the cornerstone for the National Archives Building in Washington, DC. He announced that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution would eventually be kept in the impressive structure that was to occupy the site. Indeed, it was for their keeping and display that the exhibition hall in the National Archives had been designed. Two large murals were painted for its walls. In one, Thomas Jefferson is depicted presenting the Declaration to John Hancock, President of the Continental Congress while members of that Revolutionary body look on. In the second, James Madison is portrayed submitting the Constitution to George Washington.</p><p>The final transfer of these special documents did not, however, take place until almost 20 years later. In October 1934 President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed the first Archivist of the United States, Robert Digges Wimberly Connor. The President told Connor that &quot;valuable historic documents,&quot; such as the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, would reside in the National Archives Building. The Library of Congress, especially Librarian Herbert Putnam, objected. In a meeting with the President 2 months after his appointment, Connor explained to Roosevelt how the documents came to be in the Library and that Putnam felt another Act of Congress was necessary in order for them to be transferred to the Archives. Connor eventually told the President that it would be better to leave the matter alone until Putnam retired.</p><p>When Herbert Putnam retired on April 5, 1939, Archibald MacLeish was nominated to replace him. MacLeish agreed with Roosevelt and Connor that the two important documents belonged in the National Archives. Because of World War II, during much of which the Declaration was stored at Fort Knox, and Connor's resignation in 1941, MacLeish was unable to enact the transfer. By 1944, when the Declaration and Constitution returned to Washington from Fort Knox, MacLeish had been appointed Assistant Secretary of State.</p><p>Solon J. Buck, Connor's successor as Archivist of the United States (1941-48), felt that the documents were in good hands at the Library of Congress. His successor, Wayne Grover, disagreed. Luther Evans, the Librarian of Congress appointed by President Truman in June 1945, shared Grover's opinion that the documents should be transferred to the Archives.</p><p>In 1951 the two men began working with their staff members and legal advisers to have the documents transferred. The Archives position was that the documents were federal records and therefore covered by the Federal Records Act of 1950, which was &quot;paramount to and took precedence over&quot; the 1922 act that had appropriated money for the shrine at the Library of Congress. Luther Evans agreed with this line of reasoning, but he emphasized getting the approval of the President and the Joint Committee on the Library.</p><p>Senator Theodore H. Green, Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, agreed that the transfer should take place but stipulated that it would be necessary to have his committee act on the matter. Evans went to the April 30, 1952, committee meeting alone. There is no formal record of what was said at the meeting, except that the Joint Committee on the Library ordered that the documents be transferred to the National Archives. Not only was the Archives the official depository of the government's records, it was also, in the judgment of the committee, the most nearly bombproof building in Washington.</p><p>At 11 a.m., December 13, 1952, Brigadier General Stoyte O. Ross, commanding general of the Air Force Headquarters Command, formally received the documents at the Library of Congress. Twelve members of the Armed Forces Special Police carried the 6 pieces of parchment in their helium-filled glass cases, enclosed in wooden crates, down the Library steps through a line of 88 servicewomen. An armored Marine Corps personnel carrier awaited the documents. Once they had been placed on mattresses inside the vehicle, they were accompanied by a color guard, ceremonial troops, the Army Band, the Air Force Drum and Bugle Corps, two light tanks, four servicemen carrying submachine guns, and a motorcycle escort in a parade down Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues to the Archives Building. Both sides of the parade route were lined by Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Marine, and Air Force personnel. At 11:35 a.m. General Ross and the 12 special policemen arrived at the National Archives Building, carried the crates up the steps, and formally delivered them into the custody of Archivist of the United States Wayne Grover. (Already at the National Archives was the Bill of Rights, protectively sealed according to the modern techniques used a year earlier for the Declaration and Constitution.)</p><p>The formal enshrining ceremony on December 15, 1952, was equally impressive. Chief Justice of the United States Fred M. Vinson presided over the ceremony, which was attended by officials of more than 100 national civic, patriotic, religious, veterans, educational, business, and labor groups. After the invocation by the Reverend Frederick Brown Harris, chaplain of the Senate, Governor Elbert N. Carvel of Delaware, the first state to ratify the Constitution, called the roll of states in the order in which they ratified the Constitution or were admitted to the Union. As each state was called, a servicewoman carrying the state flag entered the Exhibition Hall and remained at attention in front of the display cases circling the hall. President Harry S. Truman, the featured speaker, said:</p><p>&quot;The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are now assembled in one place for display and safekeeping. . . . We are engaged here today in a symbolic act. We are enshrining these documents for future ages. . . . This magnificent hall has been constructed to exhibit them, and the vault beneath, that we have built to protect them, is as safe from destruction as anything that the wit of modern man can devise. All this is an honorable effort, based upon reverence for the great past, and our generation can take just pride in it.&quot;</p><p>Senator Green briefly traced the history of the three documents, and then the Librarian of Congress and the Archivist of the United States jointly unveiled the shrine. Finally, Justice Vinson spoke briefly, the Reverend Bernard Braskamp, chaplain of the House of Representatives gave the benediction, the U.S. Marine Corps Band played the &quot;Star Spangled Banner,&quot; the President was escorted from the hall, the 48 flagbearers marched out, and the ceremony was over. (The story of the transfer of the documents is found in Milton O. Gustafson, &quot; The Empty Shrine: The Transfer of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution to the National Archives,&quot; The American Archivist 39 (July 1976): 271-285.)</p><p>The present shrine provides an imposing home. The priceless documents stand at the center of a semicircle of display cases showing other important records of the growth of the United States. The Declaration, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights stand slightly elevated, under armed guard, in their bronze and marble shrine. The Bill of Rights and two of the five leaves of the Constitution are displayed flat. Above them the Declaration of Independence is held impressively in an upright case constructed of ballistically tested glass and plastic laminate. Ultraviolet-light filters in the laminate give the inner layer a slightly greenish hue. At night, the documents are stored in an underground vault.</p><p>In 1987 the National Archives and Records Administration installed a $3 million camera and computerized system to monitor the condition of the three documents. The Charters Monitoring System was designed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to assess the state of preservation of the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Bill of Rights. It can detect any changes in readability due to ink flaking, off-setting of ink to glass, changes in document dimensions, and ink fading. The system is capable of recording in very fine detail 1-inch square areas of documents and later retaking the pictures in exactly the same places and under the same conditions of lighting and charge-coupled device (CCD) sensitivity. (The CCD measures reflectivity.) Periodic measurements are compared to the baseline image to determine if changes or deterioration invisible to the human eye have taken place.</p><p>The Declaration has had many homes, from humble lodgings and government offices to the interiors of safes and great public displays. It has been carried in wagons, ships, a Pullman sleeper, and an armored vehicle. In its latest home, it has been viewed with respect by millions of people, everyone of whom has had thereby a brief moment, a private moment, to reflect on the meaning of democracy. The nation to which the Declaration gave birth has had an immense impact on human history, and continues to do so. In telling the story of the parchment, it is appropriate to recall the words of poet and Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish. He described the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution as &quot;these fragile objects which bear so great a weight of meaning to our people.&quot; The story of the Declaration of Independence as a document can only be a part of the larger history, a history still unfolding, a &quot;weight of meaning&quot; constantly, challenged, strengthened, and redefined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong><p>Appendix A</p></strong><p>The 25 copies of the Dunlap broadside known to exist are dispersed among American and British institutions and private owners.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. &mdash; Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p><p>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p><p>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p><p>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</p><p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p><p>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p><p>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p><p>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p><p>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.</p><p>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p><p>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.</p><p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p><p>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.</p><p>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</p><p>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p><p>For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:</p><p>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p><p>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p><p>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:</p><p>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:</p><p>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies</p><p>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</p><p>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p><p>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</p><p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p><p>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p><p>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</p><p>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p><p>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p><p>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred. to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p><p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. &mdash; And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p><p>&mdash; John Hancock</p><p>New Hampshire:<br />Josiah Bartlett, William Whipple, Matthew Thornton</p><p>Massachusetts:<br />John Hancock, Samuel Adams, John Adams, Robert Treat Paine, Elbridge Gerry</p><p>Rhode Island:<br />Stephen Hopkins, William Ellery</p><p>Connecticut:<br />Roger Sherman, Samuel Huntington, William Williams, Oliver Wolcott</p><p>New York:<br />William Floyd, Philip Livingston, Francis Lewis, Lewis Morris</p><p>New Jersey:<br />Richard Stockton, John Witherspoon, Francis Hopkinson, John Hart, Abraham Clark</p><p>Pennsylvania:<br />Robert Morris, Benjamin Rush, Benjamin Franklin, John Morton, George Clymer, James Smith, George Taylor, James Wilson, George Ross</p><p>Delaware:<br />Caesar Rodney, George Read, Thomas McKean</p><p>Maryland:<br />Samuel Chase, William Paca, Thomas Stone, Charles Carroll of Carrollton</p><p>Virginia:<br />George Wythe, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Harrison, Thomas Nelson, Jr., Francis Lightfoot Lee, Carter Braxton</p><p>North Carolina:<br />William Hooper, Joseph Hewes, John Penn</p><p>South Carolina:<br />Edward Rutledge, Thomas Heyward, Jr., Thomas Lynch, Jr., Arthur Middleton</p><p>Georgia:<br />Button Gwinnett, Lyman Hall, George Walton</p>

Their <br />journey was a difficult one. Early in their pursuit of freedom, a man <br />named James Allen wrote in his diary, &quot;Many thinking people believe <br />America has seen its best days.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, many other Americans thought better, and the result of their determination was a government dedicated to the inherent equality of all people and their unalienable right to liberty.<br /><br />It was one group of patriots in particular - farmers and shopkeepers <br />turned colonial soldiers - that our nation relied upon to secure those <br />ideals. The soldiers suffered many defeats along the way, but they never <br />surrendered their willingness to make any sacrifice for a cause greater <br />than themselves.<br /><br />Promoting the highest of ideals and defending them at all costs is a <br />defining characteristic of what it is to be American. The American <br />commitment to a noble cause began at Lexington and Concord, but it did not <br />end with a surrender at Yorktown. The work continued -- in the courage of <br />generations who marched for suffrage and civil rights, and on hundreds <br />of battlefields, from Gettysburg to Normandy to Tal Afar.<br /><br />Today, we continue to be blessed by the service of men and women as <br />dedicated to the cause of freedom as the first generation who wore our <br />country's uniform. And it is during this time of year we reflect on our <br />freedoms and way of life secured through their actions. Those men and <br />women -- volunteers all -- serve and they sacrifice along dusty streets in<br />harsh lands, aboard ships sailing across the globe's oceans, and among<br />our communities, all with a single purpose: to make safe the blessings <br />we are privileged to enjoy.<br /><br />To each of you serving our nation's highest ideals, know that you are <br />part of a proud legacy. You have been and are making history, and you <br />will be an inspiration for the generations to come. May God bless each of <br />you. May God bless your families and your loved ones. And may God <br />continue to bless our wonderful country.<br /><br />DONALD H. RUMSFELD<br /><br />Secretary of Defense<br />

While it may seem like a great idea to reward Rover with scraps from the grill and bring him along to watch fireworks, in reality some festive foods and products can be potentially hazardous to your pets. The ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center offers the following tips:</span></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p></span>&nbsp;</div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">* <strong>Never leave alcoholic drinks unattended where pets can reach them.</strong> Alcoholic beverages have the potential to poison pets. If ingested, the animal could become very intoxicated and weak, severely depressed or could go into a coma. Death from respiratory failure is also a possibility in severe cases.<p>&nbsp;</p></span></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" /></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">* <strong>Do not apply any sunscreen or insect repellent product to your pet that is not labeled specifically for use on animals. </strong>Ingestion of sunscreen products can result in drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive thirst and lethargy. The misuse of insect repellent that contains DEET can lead to neurological problems.<p>&nbsp;</p></span></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" /></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">* <strong>Always keep matches and lighter fluid out of your pets&rsquo; reach. </strong>Certain types of matches contain chlorates, which could potentially damage blood cells and result in difficulty breathing&mdash;or even kidney disease in severe cases. Lighter fluid can be irritating to skin, and if ingested can produce gastrointestinal irritation and central nervous system depression. If lighter fluid is inhaled, aspiration pneumonia and breathing problems could develop.<p>&nbsp;</p></span></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" /></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">* <strong>Keep your pets on their normal diet.</strong> Any change, even for one meal, can give your pets severe indigestion and diarrhea. This is particularly true for older animals who have more delicate digestive systems and nutritional requirements. And keep in mind that foods such as onions, chocolate, coffee, avocado, grapes &amp; raisins, salt and yeast dough can all be potentially toxic to companion animals.<p>&nbsp;</p></span></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" /></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">* <strong>Do not put glow jewelry on your pets, or allow them to play with it. </strong>While the luminescent substance contained in these products is not highly toxic, excessive drooling and gastrointestinal irritation could still result from ingestions, and intestinal blockage could occur from swallowing large pieces of the plastic containers.<p>&nbsp;</p></span></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" /></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">* <strong>Keep citronella candles, insect coils and oil products out of reach.</strong> Ingestions can produce stomach irritation and possibly even central nervous system depression. If inhaled, the oils could cause aspiration pneumonia in pets.<p>&nbsp;</p></span></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" /></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">* <strong>Loud, crowded fireworks displays are no fun for pets,</strong> so please resist the urge to take them to Independence Day festivities. Instead, keep your little guys safe from the noise in a quiet, sheltered and escape-proof area at home. </span></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'" /></div><div style="background: white"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Source:&nbsp; American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, <a href="http://www.aspca.org/" target="_blank">www.aspca.org</a></span></div>

Our founders envisioned this <br />great Nation as a democracy, a concept that has come to define America. </p><p><br />To echo the words of President Ronald Reagan, &quot;Independence Day is more than just the birthday of a Nation. It serves as the commemoration of a revolution that changed the very concept of government.&quot;<br /><br />The citizens of the United States can be proud of our rich heritage. <br />Throughout our history, America has undergone many struggles to preserve <br />our way of life.

Jeep has signed on as the exclusive sponsor of the multi-platform program celebrating Miss FHM - a Tournament of Beauties - which includes print, online and event marketing. The program, which runs from July 2006 through February 2007, culminates with a red carpet crowning event in New York City in December. </p><p>Miss FHM 2006 - a Tournament of Beauties - kicks of with a unique ballot, a 16-page supplement polybagged with FHM's August issue that features photographs of the 64 Miss FHM contestants and an invitational-style tournament grid sponsored exclusively by Jeep(R). From FHM's September issue through to its January/February 2007 issue, the magazine will carry a number of Jeep advertisements in association with Miss FHM, including keepsake gatefolds of the tournament's leading contestants. </p><p>The Jeep brand's sponsorship takes centerstage online with a variety of advertising elements, including customized creative to support the Miss FHM online voting, newsletters, email blasts, promotional ads, logo identification and a customized microsite with streaming video of FHM photo shoots and Jeep pre-roll video spots along with corresponding banner ads. </p><p>The program also includes a Miss FHM sweepstakes featuring a grand prize package of an all-expenses paid trip for two to New York City to attend the tournament's crowning event - a gala party at a New York night club complete with Jeep red carpet arrivals and vehicle displays. FHM will create an additional customized microsite to recap the event online that will feature streaming video of the crowning and celebrity red carpet arrivals and Jeep pre-roll video spots. </p><p>&quot;The Jeep brand is introducing several new vehicles this year, including the 2007 Jeep Wrangler, effectively growing the brand's appeal with a younger consumer,&quot; said Jay Kuhnie, Director -Jeep Communications. &quot;The partnership with FHM helps us reach this young, influential audience through an integrated campaign that provides Jeep with a continuous presence and maximizes our impact.&quot; </p><p>&quot;The Miss FHM sponsorship created exclusively for Jeep underscores the power and the scope of the FHM brand. The program fires on all levels of the integrated spectrum, from print to online to event marketing,&quot; said Dana Fields, executive publisher and president of FHM. &quot;The Jeep brand's exclusive sponsorship takes Miss FHM to a new level of notoriety.&quot; </p><p>Voting for Miss FHM begins on FHMUS.com (<a href="http://www.fhmus.com/">http://www.fhmus.com</a>) with the arrival of the August issue of FHM at newsstands nationwide on July 4, 2006. FHM's first ever Miss FHM contest was held in 2005. Lauren Harris of Cherry Hill, N.J., was crowned in November of last year and received nationwide acclaim through numerous national television interviews and event appearances. </p><p>The Jeep brand's 65-year history of legendary capability has made it synonymous with freedom, adventure, mastery and authenticity. In 2006, the Jeep brand continues to deliver on its promise to provide rugged, versatile, innovative four-wheel drive vehicles with the recently introduced Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Compass, Jeep Patriot and Jeep Wrangler 4-door Unlimited. </p><p>This expansion of the Jeep brand grows its showroom from three to seven sport utility vehicles following last year's introduction of the Jeep Commander. The other two Jeep vehicles are the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Jeep Liberty. </p><p>FHM is a publication of Emap Metro LLC, an Emap plc company. FHM was launched in the U.S. in April 2000 and today is one of the country's leading young men's magazines with 5.6 million readers.

                              <strong><p>The 2006 USA TODAY Weight-Loss Challenge continues today highlighting dieter Gillian Shumway, a 29-year-old college student and waitress from Mexico, N.Y.</p></strong>The 2006 USA TODAY Weight-Loss Challenge continues today highlighting dieter Gillian Shumway, a 29-year-old college student and waitress from Mexico, N.Y.<p>Shumway is on a custom-designed eating and exercise program from Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah. On two separate occasions, she went to the spa and worked with the nutritionist, personal trainer, and executive chef. For the last three months, she has been limiting her calories to 1,600 a day and working out at the gym for about an hour five or six days a week. She has lost more than 21 pounds since the Challenge began.</p><p>The USA TODAY Weight-Loss Challenge appears each Monday through July 31 in the newspaper and online at USATODAY.com as well as on WE tv. In reporting the experiences of the participants, USA TODAY follows six dieters over seven weeks and reports on their progress toward meeting weight-loss goals.</p><p>One dieter each week is profiled. Reports look at the challenges, successes and setbacks along the journey of each dieter. Dieters had three month weight-loss goals ranging from 15 to 32 pounds. Six people who had lost weight recently in the past year, but had hit a plateau were chosen to participate in the USA TODAY Weight-Loss Challenge. The six dieters were selected by a panel of nutrition and fitness experts who reviewed videos submitted by dieters.</p><p>The dieters spent their first weekend of the Weight-Loss Challenge at the Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah, jump-starting their weight loss. Each dieter arrived at the spa with a support person -- a family member or friend - - who helped the dieter stay on track. Additionally, dieters received guidance from weight-loss and fitness professionals throughout the challenge. After the spa visit, the participants returned home with diet and exercise programs tailored to meet their needs.</p><p>The dieters then spent their last weekend together at the JW Marriott Starr Pass Resort and Spa in Tucson, Ariz., where they weighed in for the last time. The Weight-Loss Challenge will appear in the newspaper and online every Monday through July 31. On the web, go to dietchallenge.usatoday.com for more information about the dieters, great recipes from their eating plans and for the tools to start your own weight-loss challenge.</p><p>USA TODAY LIVE, the television division of the nation's newspaper, announced in February that it would bring the USA TODAY Weight-Loss Challenge to television audiences via a partnership with WE tv. USA TODAY LIVE produced eight television episodes in high definition. Each Monday's USA TODAY article highlighting an individual participant will coincide with that day's television episode. The one-hour wrap-up television finale will announce all the weight-loss results. Tonight's episode airs on WE tv at 10 p.m. ET. Check local listings for details.</p><p>About WE tv</p><p>WE tv is the only cable network dedicated to helping women connect to one another and the world around them.

                              <p></p><p>Actress Carmen Electra has been named &quot;Rising Female Star of the Year&quot; by the home entertainment industry and will receive the recognition at VSDA's Home Entertainment 2006 during the Awards Show on Tuesday, July 11, 2006 from 8:30 to 10:00 PM. The annual convention for the home entertainment industry takes place July 11-13, 2006 at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>&quot;Carmen Electra's dynamic image and personality defines what it means to be a Rising Star in the entertainment industry,&quot; said Bo Andersen, President of the Entertainment Merchants Association (EMA), which is presenting VSDA's Home Entertainment 2006. &quot;Ms. Electra has the unique ability to expand her career into multiple areas. She enjoys success as a musician, actress, television host, and performer and her career is undeniably in its ascendancy.&quot;</p><p>Carmen Electra got her start in the entertainment industry when she released a self-titled album under musical impresario Prince's record label in 1992. As a cast member of the hit television series Baywatch, Electra became a fixture on the most-watched show on television. Carmen Electra has since expanded her repertoire beyond the tanned and toned bodies of southern California's beaches by displaying her comedic abilities in box office hits such as Scary Movie, Starsky &amp; Hutch, Date Movie, and Scary Movie 4. Electra has recently made waves as the lead of the dance ensemble The Pussycat Dolls and with the release of her workout DVDs Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease.</p><p>In stores now is Tripping The Rift: The Complete Second Season, the 13-episode DVD box set of the Sci-Fi Channel's mature freaky animated series. Carmen Electra supplies the vocal talent of Six, the hottest, sexiest, and most-advanced android ever.</p><p>Anchor Bay Entertainment, an IDT Entertainment company, released the first two seasons of Tripping The Rift on DVD and will host &quot;A Night Of Stars&quot; party at VSDA's Home Entertainment 2006 on Tuesday, July 11th to honor Carmen's achievement.</p><p>&quot;We at Anchor Bay Entertainment are thrilled to be part of the Carmen Electra universe. She is dynamic, sexy and a completely original entertainer,&quot; remarked Bill Clark, General Manager, Anchor Bay Entertainment. &quot;We promise an evening of 'Electra-fying' fun!&quot;</p><p>VSDA's Home Entertainment 2006, presented by the EMA, brings together retailers, distributors, and suppliers of DVDs and video and computer games to learn about upcoming releases and industry developments and to celebrate the $32 billion home entertainment industry.</p><p>For more information about VSDA's Home Entertainment 2006, please see <a href="http://www.homeentertainmentevents.com/"><u>http://www.homeentertainmentevents.com/</u></a> </p><p>Source: Entertainment Merchants Association </p>

                              <strong><p></p></strong><strong><p>Gala Premiere Brings Bevy of Stars to the Red Carpet </p></strong><p>Cirque du Soleil, Apple Corps Ltd. and The Mirage hosted a gala premiere for LOVE with more than 4000 guests invited to an exclusive party after the performance to celebrate LOVE at The Mirage.</p><p>Guests included: Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, Olivia Harrison, Sir George Martin, Giles Martin, Julian Lennon, Cynthia Lennon, Paul McCartney, Siegfried &amp; Roy, Billy Crystal, Paul Reiser, Virginia Madsen and Rachel Leigh Cook, among others.</p><p>LOVE, the latest Cirque du Soleil creation, a co-production with Apple Corps Ltd., celebrates the musical legacy of The Beatles and is presented exclusively at The Mirage in Las Vegas. This joint artistic venture marks the first time that The Beatles company, Apple Corps Ltd., has agreed to a major theatrical partnership. The project was born out of a personal friendship and mutual admiration between the late George Harrison and Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte.</p><p>LOVE brings the magic of Cirque du Soleil together with the spirit and passion of The Beatles to create an intimate and powerful entertainment experience. It captures the essence of LOVE that John, Paul, George and Ringo inspired during their astonishing adventure together.</p><p>Sir George Martin, The Beatles original producer, and his son Giles Martin have been working with the entire archive of Beatles recordings to create the musical component for LOVE. The result is an unprecedented approach to the music for a stage production. &quot;I think we have achieved a real sense of drama with the music, the audience will feel as though they are actually in the theatre with the band. People are going to be knocked out by what they are hearing!&quot; said Giles Martin.</p><p>Using the master tapes at Abbey Road Studios, Sir George and Giles have created a unique soundscape for LOVE. &quot;We wanted to make sure there are enough good, solid hit songs in the show, but we don't want it to be a catalog of 'best of's',&quot; said Sir George Martin. &quot;We also wanted to put in some interesting and not well-known Beatles music and use fragments of songs. The show is a unique and magical experience.&quot;</p><p>Dominic Champagne, who directed and wrote the original concept for the show, explained his vision for LOVE. &quot;I wanted to create a Beatles experience rather than a Beatles story, taking the audience on an emotional journey rather than a chronological one, exploring the landscapes and experiences that have marked the group's history,&quot; said the director.</p><p>LOVE is a Rock 'n' Roll poem, a magical mystery tour into the heart and soul of The Beatles music through an exploration of the aesthetic, political and spiritual trends of the 1960s. Inspired by the poetry of the lyrics, the creative team designed a series of scenes inhabited by colorful characters in extravagant costumes.</p><p>The international cast of 60 channels a raw, youthful energy evoking the exuberant and irreverent spirit of The Beatles. High-energy fusions of urban, freestyle dance, aerial performance and fast-paced athleticism make LOVE a visual and musical feast.</p><p>LOVE is presented in a custom-built theatre at The Mirage featuring 360 degree seating and advanced high definition video projections with 100-foot digital, moving images. The panoramic surround sound system will envelop the audience who will experience The Beatles music like never before ...</p><p>Apple Corps Ltd. is planning to release The LOVE album through EMI Music later this year.</p><p>Inspiration: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr.</p><p>Cirque du Soleil Creative Team:</p><p>Guy Laliberte - Guide, Show Concept Creator</p><p>Dominic Champagne - Director and Writer, Show Concept Creator</p><p>Gilles Ste-Croix - Director of Creation, Show Concept Creator</p><p>Chantal Tremblay - Associate Director of Creation</p><p>Jean Rabasse - Theatre and Set Designer</p><p>Philippe Guillotel - Costume Designer</p><p>Jonathan Deans - Sound Designer</p><p>Yves Aucoin - Lighting Designer</p><p>Francis Laporte - Video Projection Designer</p><p>Hansel Cereza and Dave St-Pierre - Choreographers</p><p>Guy St-Amour - Acrobatic &amp; Rigging Designer</p><p>Daniel Cola - Acrobatic Performance Designer</p><p>Nathalie Gagne - Make-up Designer</p><p>Patricia Ruel - Props Designer</p><p>Michael Curry - Puppet Designer</p><p>Guest Creators:</p><p>Genevieve Dorion-Coupal - Choreographer</p><p>Daniel Ezralow - Choreographer</p><p>Margie Gillis - Choreographer</p><p>Alexis Martin - Dramaturge Consultant</p><p>Francois Perusse - Comic Audio-clips Designer</p><p>Andre Simard - Aerial Acrobatic Designer</p><p>For Apple Corps Ltd.:</p><p>Sir George Martin - Music Director</p><p>Giles Martin - Music Director</p><p>Neil Aspinall - Executive Producer</p><p>TICKET PRICES:</p><p>$150, $125, $99, $69</p><p>SHOW SCHEDULE:</p><p>LOVE will be performed Thursday through Monday with no shows on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.

Pollock, chief of the Army Nurse Corps, was on <br />hand for the ceremony. Ceremuga said he was honored to receive the <br />award, noting Army nurses are deployed worldwide in support of the global <br />war on terror.<br /><br />&quot;Army and military nurses have contributed significant and exciting <br />scientific discoveries,&quot; Ceremuga said, &quot;and provide admiral service that <br />directly supports the care of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines as <br />they serve our nation at war.&quot;<br /><br />The DAR honored another distinguished soldier, Sgt. Leigh Ann Hester, <br />with the Margaret Cochran Corbin Award. Hester, who couldn't attend the <br />ceremony to receive her award, is the first woman soldier since World <br />War II to receive the Silver Star Medal for valor.<br /><br />Hester's squad was accompanying a supply convoy in Iraq on March 20, <br />2005, when insurgents launched an ambush. Hester, a Kentucky National <br />Guard soldier, led her squad in a successful counter attack, killing three <br />insurgents with her rifle. Two other members of Hester's unit also <br />received the Silver Star for their actions that day. Hester, a member of <br />the 617th Military Police Company, was 23 years old at the time of her <br />heroics.<br /><br />The DAR also recognized America Supports You member John S. Gonsalves, <br />the 40-year-old founder and president of &quot;Homes for Our Troops&quot; based <br />in Tauton, Mass. He received the DAR's Medal of Honor. Gonsalves' <br />nonprofit organization provides specially equipped homes for wounded <br />servicemembers. His organization is part of the Defense Department's America <br />Supports You program, which assists U.S. servicemembers and their <br />families in myriad ways and spotlights the support they enjoy from the <br />American public and the nation's corporate sector.<br /><br />Gonsalves, a former contractor, told American Forces Press Service that <br />he was &quot;just thrilled&quot; to receive the DAR award.<br /><br />&quot;I never expected to get something quite like this,&quot; he said, noting <br />the honor &quot;is very humbling.&quot;<br /><br />Gonsalves said &quot;Homes for Our Troops&quot; has committed to build 20 homes <br />for wounded servicemembers, with seven completed.<br /><br />&quot;Supporting our troops is something that's been going on since the <br />Revolutionary War,&quot; Gonsalves said. &quot;And, I think that there's been times <br />in our country's history where the support wasn't quite up to par.&quot;<br /><br />U.S. servicemembers serving in the global war against terrorism <br />definitely need the support of the American public, Gonsalves said.<br /><br />&quot;I like to think that there are two kinds of people out there -- those <br />who serve and those who support,&quot; Gonsalves said. &quot;Maybe not everyone <br />can serve in the military, but everybody can certainly support them.&quot;<br /><br />The National Society Daughters of the American Revolution was founded <br />in 1890 to promote patriotism, preserve American history, and support <br />better education for America's children. Its members can trace their <br />lineage back to the patriots who won American independence during the <br />Revolutionary War. The DAR is one of the world's largest service <br />organizations, with 168,000 members and 3,000 chapters worldwide. The organization <br />publishes the magazine, &quot;American Spirit.&quot;<br /><br />

                              <p>Fireworks originated in China some 2,000 years ago. The most prevalent legend has it that fireworks were discovered or invented by accident by a Chinese cook working in a field kitchen who happened to mix charcoal, sulphur and saltpeter (all commonly found in the kitchen in those days). The mixture burned and when compressed in an enclosure (a bamboo tube), the mixture exploded. </p><p>Some sources say that the discovery of fireworks occurred about 2,000 years ago, and other sources place the discovery sometime during the 9th century during the Song dynasty (960-1279), although this could be confusion between the discovery of gunpowder by the cook and the invention of the firecracker. </p><p>Some sources suggest that fireworks may have originated in India, but in the October 18, 2003, online edition of The Hindu, an Indian national newspaper, the Chinese are credited with the discovery of gunpowder. </p><p>A Chinese monk named Li Tian, who lived near the city of Liu Yang in Hunan Province, is credited with the invention of firecrackers about 1,000 years ago. The Chinese people celebrate the invention of the firecracker every April 18 by offering sacrifices to Li Tian. During the Song Dynasty, the local people established a temple to worship Li Tian. </p><p>The firecrackers, both then and now, are thought to have the power to fend off evil spirits and ghosts that are frightened by the loud bangs of the firecrackers. Firecrackers are used for such purposes today at most events such as births, deaths and birthdays. Chinese New Year is a particularly popular event that is celebrated with firecrackers to usher in the new year free of the evil spirits. </p><p>To this day the Liu Yang region of Hunan Province remains the main production area in the world for fireworks. It is important to remember the geographic origin of fireworks, because often detractors of the fireworks industry say that fireworks are produced in China to take advantage of cheap labor. But the reality is that the fireworks industry existed in China long before the advent of the modern era and long before the disparity in east-west wage rates, and hopefully the fireworks industry will exist long after the existence of communism has an effect over the Chinese economy. </p><p>Generally Marco Polo is credited with bringing the Chinese gunpowder back to Europe in the 13th century, although some accounts credit the Crusaders with bringing the black powder to Europe as they returned from their journeys. </p><p>Once in Europe, the black powder was used for military purposes, first in rockets, then in canons and guns. Italians were the first Europeans who used the black powder to manufacture fireworks. Germany was the other European country to emerge as a fireworks leader along with Italy in the 18th century. It is interesting to note that many of the leading American display companies are operated by families of Italian descent such as the Grucci family, Rozzi family, and Zambelli family. </p><p>The English were also fascinated with fireworks. Fireworks became very popular in Great Britain during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. William Shakespeare mentions fireworks in his works, and fireworks were so much enjoyed by the Queen herself that she created the position of &quot;Fire Master of England.&quot; King James II was so pleased with the fireworks display that celebrated his coronation that he knighted his Fire Master. </p><p>In the modern era, the American fireworks industry really began to influence Chinese manufacturers following President Nixon's normalization of relations with the Chinese Communist government in the early 1970s. Prior to that time, business was being done between U.S. and Chinese companies through Hong Kong brokers with little or no direct contact with mainland manufacturers. </p><p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the distribution channels in China were essentially state owned factories producing fireworks that were then exported through government owned provincial export corporations. Products produced in Hunan went through the Hunan Export Corporation, and products produced in Jiangxi went through the Jiangxi Export Corporation, and so on. During this period, factories were not required to make a profit, but rather their goal was to keep people working in a region of China where there was no real industry other than agriculture. The Chinese government subsidized these factories to keep production going. </p><p>The Provincial Export Corporation in turn sold to Hong Kong brokers who were the link between Mainland China and the foreign business entities. The Hong Kong brokers procured orders, arranged logistics, and helped finance shipments to the U.S. distributors. </p><p>It was also during this time period that the first formally educated leader of China, Chairman Deng Xiaoping, saw what his counterparts in the former Soviet Bloc did not see, and that is that Communism simply did not work economically. Chairman Deng began a policy of economic reform that basically set China on the road toward capitalism. </p><p>During the 1980s, China opened up dramatically to travel within its borders for visiting U.S. importers. This enabled the first American fireworks buyers to travel to the production regions and establish relations with Hong Kong exporters and the provincial export corporations. </p><p>In the late 1980s, consumer fireworks became the focus of intense scrutiny by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Up to this point, most of the fireworks products had old generic export corporation labels that had incorrect warning labels based on item size and performance. To correct the situation, representatives from the CPSC, American Pyrotechnics Association, and Hong Brokers Association spent 10 days in Southern China meeting with representatives from each export corporation and factory managers, on a province by province basis. </p><p>The meetings involved shooting each item produced in China and determining what the appropriate and correct warning descriptions and print size should be from the point of view of providing safe warning labels for the American consumers. The Americans involved took on the infamous moniker of &quot;The Shekou Six&quot; by most of the shell shocked Chinese industry people, and from that meeting and a few that followed was born the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory (AFSL) which monitors firework production within China to this day. </p><p>In the 1990s, economic reform continued under Chairman Jiang Zemin as Chinese factories were weaned off government funding and forced to turn a profit for the first time. It was during this period that many Provincial Export Corporation personnel left the government owned companies and were permitted to start their own. </p><p>Initially these new private companies worked through the established Hong Kong brokers to reach the U.S. market, but within a few years they were selling directly to U.S. importers. </p><p>In order to survive, Hong Kong brokers invested money into Chinese factories and joint-ventured with Chinese entrepreneurs to start their own exclusive product lines and for their remaining larger customers. With the loss of key personnel, the government provincial export corporations never quite adapted to economic reform, and today most are gone or left selling to domestic Chinese markets. </p><p>The 1990s saw the rapid growth of private labels in order for U.S. companies to differentiate their product lines. In the 2000s, China is a basic &quot;free for all,&quot; with small mainland export-broker companies forming and folding each month. Additionally, separate factories are attempting to bypass historical channels and selling directly to U.S. importers. Each week American companies receive a half dozen e-mails or fax communications asking for the American companies to place orders directly with some small new and obscure factories that would like to begin exporting to the United States</p>

The station will be visible with the naked eye, because it's in low Earth orbit and large enough to reflect sunlight.<br /><br />WHEN: Starting at about 9:35 p.m. EDT Tuesday, July 4.</p><p>&nbsp;<span class="detailImageDesc">The International Space Station won't appear this large in the skies over Washington on July 4, but it will be a clearly visible point of light. Image credit: NASA.</span> <br /><br />This year, the hundreds of thousands of people gathered to watch fireworks on Washington's National Mall will see one extra light in the sky. If clouds don't obscure it, the International Space Station will be visible for seven minutes as it passes over North America. <br /><br />The station will appear on the northwest horizon at 9:35 p.m. EDT, moving higher and into the northern sky before descending toward the eastern-southeastern horizon. At 9:40 p.m. EDT, the station will be in the northeast sky with an elevation of 50 degrees, meaning it will be more than halfway up toward the zenith, the point of the sky directly overhead. Just after 9:42 p.m., the station will disappear below the eastern-southeastern horizon. <br /><br />The station should be visible to anyone within about 50 miles of Washington. For someone standing in the center of the Mall, the station will appear to rise from behind the Museum of American History, pass over the Museum of Natural History and the National Gallery of Art, and disappear behind the U.S. Capitol. <br /><br />During the pass, the station will be flying southeast across Canada and the United States. When it becomes visible, the station will be northwest of Lake Superior, crossing over the upper peninsula of Michigan, Lake Michigan, Wisconsin, Luke Huron, Ontario, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. As it disappears from view it will be moving out over the Atlantic Ocean. <br /><br />To find a list of sighting opportunities for the International Space Station and the space shuttle, visit <a href="javascript:openNASAWindow('http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html')">NASA's Sighting Opportunities</a> page. <br /><br /><!-- Body ends --></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told 4,000 DAR members gathered in Constitution Hall for their 115th annual meeting.<br /><br />While deployed to far-flung locales like Afghanistan or Iraq to perform <br />arduous, dangerous duty, those servicemembers &quot;probably are not <br />repeating the words of their oath to themselves,&quot; Pace said, &quot;but they know <br />the oath they have taken.&quot;<br /><br />Servicemembers have vowed not only to defend their country, Pace said, <br />but they've also taken a pledge to help their fellow soldiers, sailors, <br />airmen and Marines during the thick of battle.<br /><br />Pace saluted the DAR for honoring the U.S. military. The four-star <br />general said it is also &quot;appropriate that those of us who currently serve <br />in uniformed service take time tonight to thank you back.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;This country is amazing,&quot; Pace said in reflection of his 39 years of <br />military service. &quot;Those of us who have had the privilege of serving in <br />your armed forces have some fond memories and some not so fond <br />memories.&quot;<br /><br />Pace touched upon his Vietnam War experiences, noting he'd &quot;lost some <br />wonderful young men&quot; in combat during his time as a young Marine rifle <br />platoon leader. Those fallen Marines &quot;gave their lives for this country <br />... they'd be delighted to see the patriotism in this room,&quot; the <br />general said.<br /><br />As Pace provided his thanks to the DAR for honoring America's <br />servicemembers, he also asked the organization to remember the sacrifices of <br />military families.<br /><br />&quot;I know for a fact that when we go off to war, our families wait at <br />home silently and pray that we'll come home safely,&quot; Pace said. &quot;And those <br />of us who do not come safely leave a vacancy in those families that can <br />never be replaced.&quot;<br /><br />Servicemembers &quot;who do come home safely stand tall and receive awards,&quot; <br />Pace said, while their families &quot;stand in the background and pretend <br />they had nothing to do with it.&quot; Military families, he said, remind <br />servicemembers of the vital importance of their duty.<br /><br />&quot;They dust us off,&quot; Pace said, &quot;and they put us back into the fight.&quot;<br /><br />In essence, &quot;those military families who do not wear the uniform are <br />serving this country as well as anyone who ever did wear it,&quot; Pace said. <br />&quot;And all of us who do wear the uniform are so enormously proud of them. <br />I wish they could see you, I wish they could feel what I felt when I <br />first walked in here tonight.<br /><br />&quot;Thank you for all the good works that you do. Thank you for the so <br />many ways that you show your love of this country,&quot; the general said. &quot;God <br />bless you and may 115 years from now this hall will be filled again <br />with wonderful ladies like you.&quot;<br /><br />Presley Merritt Wagoner, the Daughters of the American Revolution <br />president-general, thanked Pace for his words, noting his &quot;positive remarks <br />certainly leave us all with feelings of trust and confidence in our <br />military and with a great deal of pride in our citizenship as Americans.&quot;<br /><br />Wagoner presented Pace with the DAR Patriot award, which, she said, &quot;is <br />given to an individual who has exhibited heroic efforts and unwavering <br />commitment in defending the United States of America.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And, you, sir, not only deserve this award,&quot; Wagoner told Pace. &quot;You <br />are the embodiment of its spirit.&quot;<br /><br />Pace responded: &quot;On behalf of your 2.4 million servicemen and women, I <br />accept this on their behalf. Thank you very much.&quot;<br /><br />

Visibility was adequate for the inspection from most areas of the FSS and the MLP deck.</p><p align="justify">No MLP deck anomalies were detected, and the facility was in good condition. </p><p align="justify">No anomalies were observed on the SRBs.</p><p align="justify">Orbiter tiles, RCC panels, and SSMEs were in nominal configuration. The FRCS Tyvek (parachute-style) covers were intact.</p><p align="justify">The GOX vent hood was in the retracted position. GOX Vent Arm was retracted while we were on the 255&rsquo; Level. No anomalies were detected on the ET nose cone as the &ndash;Y vent louvers were nominal; however, a 1-inch dia spot of missing topcoat was found on the &ndash;Y LO2 Ogive Vent Seal footprint. The missing topcoat is located approx 5 inches aft of the XT-371 interface and centered below the &ndash;Y louvers. An IPR was initiated for this item.</p><p align="justify">The GH2 Ventline and the ET Ground Umbilical Carrier Assembly (GUCA) were observed to be in good condition. The ice/frost buildup on the aft side of the ET GUCA had completely melted.</p><p align="justify">Overall the External Tank appeared to be in good condition. Visible portions of the LO2 tank TPS looked acceptable as well as the LO2-I/T flange closeout &ndash; no TPS anomalies were detected during vehicle warmup. The LH2-I/T flange closeout also was observed to be free of defects. The Bipod Fitting closeouts and Jack Pad standoff closeouts were observed to be in nominal condition - no TPS divots resulted from vehicle warmup.</p><p align="justify"><strong>The inboard strut for the L02 Feedline Bracket assembly at XT-1129 was found to be cracked. The damage is approx 5-6 inches long and appears to originate near the where the strut connects to the feedline and extends toward the ET. The TPS crack is approx &frac14; inch wide with an offset of approx &frac14; inch. An IPR was initiated for this item. Inboard views of the remaining visible brackets did not reveal any similar damage. Outboard views of the feedline brackets revealed areas of TPS debris in the gap between the feedline and the bracket &ndash; this condition was noticed at XT-1129, 1377, and 1623. No obvious indications of crushed foam or debris was detected at the XT-1871 and 1978 brackets.</strong> </p><p align="justify">The Ice Frost Ramps did not exhibit any obvious defects. The stress relief crack on the &ndash;Y Vertical Strut forward-facing TPS had not completely closed by the time of our inspection and was still barely visible &ndash; approx 1/8 inch wide. The -Y Longeron Closeout and the new LO2/LH2 PAL Ramp footprint machined areas looked acceptable. The aft outboard bondline for the +Y Longeron closeout exhibited froth during cryo drain monitoring; however, the area on post-drain inspection did not reveal any TPS crack, bondline separation, or any other obvious TPS defect. There was still a light ice/frost buildup in the TSE shipping strut fitting access cavity. All PDL repairs on the ET were intact and none protruded beyond drawing trim lines. </p><p align="justify">Light ice/frost buildups remained in the &ndash;Z sides of the LH2 feedline bellows and recirculation line bellows, LH2 ET/ORB umbilical purge vents and pyro can vents, and LH2 umbilical cable tray drain hole. All ice/frost buildups on the LO2 ET/ORB Umbilical had melted. Moderate amount of ice/frost buildup remained on the lower EB fittings and in the ET/SRB cable tray expansion joints. No TPS defects were noted on any of these surfaces. The LO2/LH2 purge curtains were clean and free of ice/frost buildup.</p><p align="justify">The frostball formation present for both tankings at the +Y Vertical Strut-to-Aft Dome interface had melted. No indication of a TPS crack or other damage was evident.</p><p align="justify">A 1-inch froth line was observed on the &ndash;Z side of the LH2 Aft Dome Manhole Cover TPS closeout. This item was located in the vicinity of the frost spot that was observed on the first tanking. No crack or other TPS defect was visible.</p><p align="justify">In summary, two IPR conditions were initiated as a result of this walkdown &ndash; the TPS damage on the XT-1129 LO2 Feedline Bracket and the missing topcoat on the &ndash;Y GO2 Vent Seal footprint. No other flight hardware concerns were detected during the post drain inspection. Additional evaluation of the noted IPR areas will be performed prior to the next ET load attempt.</p><p align="justify">John Blue Juan Ramirez </p><p align="justify">NASA-KSC Lockheed-Martin KSC</p><p>Kevin Vega Ahmad Ekhlassi</p><p>NASA-KSC USA-KSC</p></div>

                              <p><strong>LA Times Article &ndash; All rights reserved </strong></p><p><strong>Who Pays for Twins' Dramatic Operation?</strong> </p><p><strong>The emotionally compelling -- and expensive -- separation of conjoined sisters raises delicate questions about healthcare costs.</strong> </p><p>By Rong-Gong Lin II and Juliet Chung, Times Staff Writers&nbsp;<br />July 2, 2006 </p><p>It was a bold rescue effort, offering tiny conjoined twin sisters, only 10 months old, hope for a normal life. Eighty doctors and nurses worked in a 22-hour surgery to separate Regina and Renata Salinas Fierros, fused from the lower chest to the pelvis, locked in an awkward embrace.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The successful surgery at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles last month made national headlines, and reporters kept a virtually round-the-clock presence. </p><p>But for all of the publicity the case has received, hospital and state officials have remained tight-lipped about one key aspect of the twins' care: the cost, at least a portion of which will be paid by taxpayers.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Cost, however, is a growing concern in American medicine, and as prices rise, a debate is raging over where dollars should flow.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Experts say cases like the twins' highlight the lengths to which the system sometimes goes to rescue individuals in dramatic and emotionally compelling situations, even as those with chronic or more mundane conditions often struggle to afford care. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />In that context, many ethicists and economists say, it is worth asking some uncomfortable questions about single, expensive cases.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, put the matter bluntly: &quot;Is that the best use of scarce dollars?&quot; he asked after hearing the twins' case described. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />He acknowledged, as did several colleagues, that most Americans would consider the very question &quot;morally untouchable.&quot; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />To parents and caregivers, such procedures often are perceived as priceless &mdash; worth doing at any cost. But they do come at a price, even if it is not made public.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Judging from other separations of conjoined twins, the Salinas Fierros' surgery alone could approach $1 million or more. Months, perhaps years, of aftercare could push the bill much higher.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />None of the ethicists and economists consulted by The Times argued that the girls, specifically, should not have been separated. But several said this case and others underscored some of the system's unspoken priorities. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Our medical culture is not to take into account the common good, but the needs of this particular patient who needs to be saved,&quot; said Stephen G. Post, a bioethics professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;As soon as you get to an individual case, human emotions take over. Rationality takes a back seat,&quot; Post said. &quot;If it's your child&quot; and the cost of care is astronomical, &quot;you don't care, because it's your child. In the end, people advocate passionately and effectively for their nearest and dearest.&quot;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Others defended such expenditures on humanitarian grounds.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;My feeling is these are very exceptional cases,&quot; said Norman Daniels, an ethics professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, &quot;and any system as rich as ours should be able to swallow these.&quot;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;To work in an uncompassionate system would be quite horrible,&quot; said Nancy Dubler, director of the bioethics division at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Separating conjoined twins has created considerable controversy in the past, at least in the medical field. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />In an article in the Hastings Center Report, a bioethics journal, about one Massachusetts case in 1999, Dr. Peter Ratiu and bioethicist Peter Singer questioned the &quot;allocation of scarce public healthcare resources&quot; on a $500,000 operation, noting the money could pay for 77 elderly couples' medication for a year, as well as treatment of 25 cases of tuberculosis in the United States or 2,500 in Haiti.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Robert J. Wells, a pediatrician, blasted the pair for proposing a system in which it would be &quot;the duty of individuals to die because society &hellip; has decided they are not worthy enough to justify the use of additional resources,&quot; according to a letter he wrote to the Hastings Center Report in 2001. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Ratiu and Singer wrote in response, &quot;The first step toward the solution must be, however, the open discussion of the problem, however unpopular this might be.&quot; </p><p>Instances of conjoined twins are rare &mdash; the condition in the Salinas Fierros case, known as ischiopagus tetrapus, occurs once in 2.5 million births &mdash; but the expenditure of large sums on so-called heroic treatment is not unusual in American medicine. Some of the most costly cases involve the very young &mdash; premature infants, for instance &mdash; and very old. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />No one involved with the Salinas Fierros case would specify or even speculate on its costs, primarily citing patient confidentiality.</p><p>&quot;We're a private nonprofit hospital. We don't discuss funding. There are privacy issues involved,&quot; said Ken Wildes, a spokesman for Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, which shared the cost of the procedure with the government-funded Medi-Cal program.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />But published accounts indicate that the estimated cost of a 2004 operation to separate twins conjoined between the breastbone and navel at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C., was $750,000 to $1 million. And the estimated tab for dividing Guatemalan twins who were conjoined at the head at UCLA three years ago was $2 million &mdash; an amount paid by the hospital and private donors.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Regina and Renata Salinas Fierros became eligible for Medi-Cal, the government health insurance program for the poor, when they were born at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center last August.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />They are U.S. citizens by birth and, according to state officials, met income requirements for the program. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Their parents, Sonia Fierros and Federico Salinas, are Mexican nationals who came to the United States on tourist visas last year, intending to stay just 15 days for a visit with relatives. The couple said they had their visas extended after Fierros was hospitalized for a urinary tract infection and learned that she was carrying conjoined twins. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;We knew she was pregnant, we just didn't know they were joined. When we found out, everything changed,&quot; said Federico Salinas, 36, a part-time restaurant worker from Juarez, before the surgery. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;We thought, here, they would be able to get better medical care,&quot; said Sonia Fierros, 23.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The couple declined through a hospital spokesperson to talk about costs. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Some ethicists said the twins' particular circumstances raise another wrinkle in the discussion.<strong> &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /></strong>&quot;We have a huge investment of resources going to children who only accidentally became Americans,&quot; Caplan said.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />But Daniels said a mother who discovers that she is carrying conjoined twins in the U.S. has no less of a right to care than does a foreigner who gets into a car accident here.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Some experts said the case was worth pondering for its larger implications rather than its specific circumstances. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;It's a stupid system that makes it easier to get a very sophisticated operation than it does to get life-saving ordinary care,&quot; said Mary Ann Baily, associate for ethics and health policy at the Hastings Center, a nonprofit ethics center in Garrison, N.Y.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;But why pick on these people?&quot; she added. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Broadly speaking, the system tends to favor people with exotic conditions over those who have more common illnesses, health experts and ethicists said. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Some noted that while routine ear and eye exams and dental care aren't guaranteed for all children, for instance, the system might easily fund a rare million-dollar procedure. That sum could enable the state to insure more than 800 children for a year, according to figures provided by the California HealthCare Foundation.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The twins' surgery comes as U.S. emergency rooms are overburdened, government reimbursements are shrinking and 46 million Americans remain uninsured, with some seeking treatment only when they are desperate. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />But even in the face of galloping healthcare costs, Americans resist the idea of rationing healthcare.</p><p>&quot;We spend open-endedly, especially in a crisis, and then figure out how to pay for it later,&quot; said George Annas, chairman of the department of health law, bioethics and human rights at Boston University School of Public Health.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Not all societies share this attitude. Amish community elders just east of Cleveland, for instance, sometimes decline to pay for care if it is deemed too costly, Post said.</p><p>Similarly, though U.S. hospitals often invest huge resources on severely underweight premature babies, some in European countries are less likely to try to save them, knowing that the baby may not survive or that the child may be severely impaired for life.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Even so, Annas and others suspect the American public wouldn't stand for refusing surgery for conjoined twins like the Salinas Fierros girls. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;In a sense, everyone's playing the system that we have: The parents are playing the system, and the hospitals are too, and the doctors,&quot; Annas said, referring to the publicity that hospitals receive.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;Nonetheless,&quot; he said, &quot;we all want the separation, and [say] money is no object, even though it is.&quot; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />At Childrens, doctors have deliberately avoided consideration of the costs.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;We try not to think about how much it costs because I don't want anyone on the team to be influenced by those considerations,&quot; said Dr. Henri R. Ford, chief of pediatric surgery. &quot;We want to focus on treating those kids like they are the children or grandchildren of President Bush.&quot;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />While the twins' surgery was probably not necessary for them to live, doctors said their development and quality of life would have been severely impaired without it. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;It is likely they would have needed future surgeries if they had stayed together because of the position of their bodies and the potential for skin breakdown, limbs becoming frozen in certain positions, things like that, that would have made even moving them around impossible,&quot; said Dr. James E. Stein, the pediatric surgeon who led the operation.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />There is no way of knowing whether these treatments would have cost more than separating the twins in the first place. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Two weeks after their surgery, the girls remain in the pediatric intensive care unit in serious condition, with stable vital signs. The cost of treating them<strong> </strong>will continue to mount. While the girls' father said he hopes to raise his children &mdash; the twins and two other children &mdash; in Mexico, he expects his family to stay in the U.S. for several years because of the twins' condition.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Officials at Childrens make no apologies. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&quot;When we know we have the best chance for these kids, we know we have the services, we know we have the people &mdash; they've done it successfully before &mdash; how could we possibly say we are not going to do this?&quot; Wildes said. &quot;These children needed our help and we gave them that help. To a certain extent that's all that should matter, if we're human beings</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>PLEASE BUY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES.&nbsp;WITHOUT PUBLICATIONS LIKE&nbsp;THEIRS READING WILL BECOME A LOST ART.&nbsp;THE INFORMATION YOU GET&nbsp;COSTS LESS THEN THE COST OF A SOFT DRINK&nbsp; AND LASTS MUCH LONGER.</strong></p>

Today's Angelus was the Pope's last before his apostolic trip to Valencia and his summer holidays, which he is due to spend in Italy's Valle d'Aosta region.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>The Holy Father recalled that the first such gathering of families took place in Rome in 1994 on the occasion of the International Year of the Family promoted by the United Nations. It was then that John Paul II wrote his famous Letter to Families. Subsequent World Meetings of Families have been held in Rio de Janeiro (1997), Rome (2000) for the occasion of the Jubilee of Families, and Manila (2003). &quot;It is important,&quot; Pope Benedict said, &quot;that today's families also hear the memorable appeal launched 25 years ago in the Apostolic Exhortation 'Familiaris consortio' by John Paul II: 'Family, become what you are!'.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>The Holy Father proceeded: &quot;The theme of the forthcoming Valencia meeting is the transmission of faith within the family. This is what has inspired the motto of my apostolic visit to that city: 'Families, live and transmit the faith!' In so many of today's secularized communities, the primary need for believers in Christ is precisely that of renewing the faith of adults, that they may become capable of communicating that faith to the new generations. At the same time, the path of Christian initiation of babies and children can become a useful occasion for parents to draw near the Church once more, and deepen their knowledge of the beauty and truth of the Gospel.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;The family,&quot; he added, &quot;is a living organism in which a reciprocal exchange of gifts takes place, what is important is that the Word of God, which keeps the flame of faith alive, should never be lacking. During the rite of Baptism, in an extremely significant gesture, the father or godfather lights a candle at the great Easter candle, symbol of the risen Christ; then, addressing the members of the family, the celebrants says: 'ensure that your baby, illuminated by Christ, always lives as a child of the light'.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>The Pope concluded: &quot;In order to be authentic, that gesture - which contains all the significance of the transmission of faith within the family - must be preceded and accompanied by the commitment of parents to deepen their knowledge of their own faith, reviving its flame through prayer and the assiduous practice of the Sacraments of Confession and the Eucharist.&quot;</span></p><span><br /></span>&nbsp;<span>ANG/FAMILY/...<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>VIS 060703 (460)<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><strong><span>PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE IN HOLY LAND AND IN IRAQ<br /></span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span>After praying the Angelus today with thousands of faithful gathered in St. Peter's Square, the Pope spoke of the &quot;growing concern&quot; with which he was following events in Iraq and the Holy Land.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;Faced, on the one hand, with blind violence that provokes appalling massacres and, on the other, with the threat of a worsening of the crisis which over the last few days has become even more dramatic, what is needed is justice and a serious and credible commitment to peace, which unfortunately are nowhere to be seen.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;For this reason,&quot; the Holy Father added, &quot;I invite everyone to join in faithful and persistent prayer: may the Lord illuminate hearts and may no one evade their duty to construct peaceful coexistence, recognizing that all men are brothers, whatever the people to which they belong.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>The Pope then recalled that in Moscow, Russia, from July 3 to 5 &quot;an important summit meeting of religious leaders&quot; is taking place, &quot;organized by the inter-religious council of Russia. At the invitation of the Patriarch of Moscow, the Catholic Church is taking part with its own delegation. I wish to communicate my most cordial greetings to His Holiness Alexis II and to all the participants.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Benedict XVI went on: &quot;This important meeting of so many religious leaders of the world, is a sign of a shared desire to promote dialogue between civilizations and a search for a more just and peaceful world order. I hope that, with sincere commitment on everyone's part, areas for effective collaboration may be identified, while maintaining respect and mutual understanding, in order to face up to today's challenges.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>&quot;For Christians,&quot; the Pope added, &quot;this means learning to know one another even more profoundly and to esteem one another, in the light of man's dignity and his eternal destiny. Giving assurances of my prayers to God that He may render the summit's work fruitful, upon everyone I invoke abundant blessings from heaven.&quot;<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Turning then to address French pilgrims, the Pope said: &quot;May the holidays be a period for rest and of more intense family life, in order to strengthen ties between generations, especially enabling young people to talk with adults upon essential questions of faith and the meaning of life.&quot;</span></p><span><br /></span>&nbsp;<span>ANG/HOLY LAND:RUSSIA/...<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>VIS 060703 (390)<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><strong><span>AUDIENCES<br /></span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span>The Holy Father today received in separate audiences:<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>- Cardinal Antonio Maria Rouco Varela, archbishop of Madrid, Spain.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>- Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, prefect of the Congregation for Bishops.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>- Three prelates from the Croatian Bishops' Conference, on their &quot;ad limina&quot; visit:<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- Archbishop Ivan Prendja of Zadar.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- Archbishop Ivan Devcic of Rijeka.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- Bishop Ivan Milovan of Porec i Pula.<br /></span><span>&nbsp;<br /></span><p><span><span>&nbsp; </span>On Saturday, July 1, he received in audience Archbishop Paul Josef Cordes, president of the Pontifical Council &quot;Cor Unum.&quot;</span></p><span><br /></span>&nbsp;<span>AP:AL/.../...<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>VIS 060703 (90)<br /></span><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion3" --><!-- InstanceEndEditable -->

                              <p>El mobiliario convencional permanece en contacto con la tierra a trav&eacute;s de la gravedad. La cama flotante supera esta energ&iacute;a fundamental y cae hacia el cielo. Cuatro cables finos garantizan su posici&oacute;n inm&oacute;vil y constituyen el &uacute;nico contacto con el suelo. <br /></p><p>Gracias al uso inteligente de material permanentemente magn&eacute;tico, la cama flotante puede soportar una carga de 900 kilogramos. Con una distancia flotante de 40 cent&iacute;metros, uno puede pensar en diferentes funciones para su uso, tales como cama, sof&aacute;, mesa de comer japonesa, para exponer productos o como base para un pabell&oacute;n flotante. El campo magn&eacute;tico encima de la cama flotante es reducido en gran medida para que las tarjetas bancarias no sean liquidadas. <br /></p><p>El arquitecto Janjaap Ruijssenaars, de 33 a&ntilde;os, trabaj&oacute; durante seis a&ntilde;os con varios especialistas como Bakker Magnetics, en el desarrollo de la cama flotante. Es un proyecto que ha alcanzado su viabilidad t&eacute;cnica recientemente. <br /></p><p>La presentaci&oacute;n mundial de la cama flotante tuvo lugar en junio de 2006, con la presentaci&oacute;n del modelo a escala (1:5) en la Feria de Millonarios en Kortrijk (B&eacute;lgica) y en la Feria del Dise&ntilde;o 100% en R&oacute;terdam (Pa&iacute;ses Bajos). El concepto y los usos diferentes est&aacute;n registrados y protegidos por el dise&ntilde;ador Janjaap Ruijssenaars. <br /></p><p>Extra: <br /></p><p>El objeto aqu&iacute; expuesto puede entenderse como la f&oacute;rmula captada por Stanley Kubrick en su pel&iacute;cula de 1968 '2001: Odisea en el Espacio'. El monolito, como sugieren Stanley Kubrick y el escritor de ciencia ficci&oacute;n, Arthur C. Clarke, debi&oacute; ser construido por otras energ&iacute;as que aquellas responsables de los cuerpos planetarios normalmente circulares y otras formas m&aacute;s liberales, tales como los organismos. El rect&aacute;ngulo como met&aacute;fora para la existencia de vida inteligente. <br /></p><p>El subt&iacute;tulo de la Cama Flotante es '2001: Una rareza'. <br /></p><p>Precios gu&iacute;a: <br /></p><p>Cama Flotante 1:5 - EUR 115,000 <br /></p><p>Cama Flotante 1:1 - EUR 1,200.000 <br /></p><p>ir. Janjaap Ruijssenaars (1973) es arquitecto (M&aacute;ster en Ciencias) y fundador de Universe Architecture. <br /></p><p>Su trabajo incluye planificaci&oacute;n urbana, arquitectura y dise&ntilde;o. Al reflejar &eacute;stas profesiones la una sobre la otra, nuevas ideas y formas fascinantes emergen. La Cama Flotante es un ejemplo curioso de este proceso de interrelaci&oacute;n disciplinaria. <br /></p>

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;FIFTY SIX of the bravest officers in England and Wales will be honoured next week at the prestigious Police Bravery Awards organised by the Police Federation of England and Wales and sponsored by The Sun. <br /></p><p>They will be drawn from 32 forces and will attend 10 Downing Street for a reception with the Prime Minister on Thursday 13 July before the evening gala awards at The Dorchester, in the presence of HRH The Duke of Kent, the Home Secretary Dr John Reid and a host of celebrities. <br /></p><p>Each nominee will have been voted the bravest officer in their force by local Police Federation representatives and will receive recognition for placing themselves at risk of death or serious harm to uphold the law and/or protect the public. <br /></p><p>As well as being hailed the most courageous officer in their own force, nominees could be voted one of eight regional winners. The areas comprise the South East, South West, London, the East, Midlands, Wales, North East and North West. The overall winner is selected from among the regional finalists. <br /></p><p>Discussing the importance of the ceremony, Jan Berry, Chairman of the Police Federation, said: &quot;The Police Bravery Awards aim to honour the unsung heroes of the police service - the men and women in blue who go above and beyond the call of duty to protect the public and uphold the law. So often their courage goes unnoticed and unpublicised. These awards are designed to redress the balance.&quot; <br /></p><p>Rebekah Wade, Editor of The Sun, said: &quot;Thousands of policemen and women put their lives at risk every day. Yet their work often goes unrecognised by the public they work to protect. The Police Bravery Awards were set up to salute the bravest of the brave; the policemen and women whose quick thinking, courage and selflessness protects us all. The Sun is proud to put the spotlight on the incredible service they perform. We owe them a great debt.&quot; <br /></p><p>&nbsp; Avon and Somerset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hampshire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><pre>South Wales  Cheshire  Hertfordshire  South Yorkshire     Cleveland  </pre><pre>Kent  Suffolk     Cumbria   Lancashire   Sussex    </pre><pre>Derbyshire   Lincolnshire    Thames Valley  Devon &amp; Cornwall     Merseyside     </pre><pre>Warwickshire     Dorset    Metropolitan   West Mercia     Durham                 </pre><pre>Northamptonshire  West Midlands     Dyfed Powys   North Wales              </pre><pre>West Yorkshire     Essex    Nottinghamshire   Wiltshire     Greater Manchester </pre><pre>Gwent </pre>

EDT     Q     Disappointed?  </pre><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Sure. I was down here -- when I was a member of Congress, early in the program in the '80s -- really looking forward to today; especially looking forward to having my grandkids here. But it's not to be today, and maybe it'll work tomorrow.<br /></p><p>Q What was their impression so far, the girls?<br /></p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Very impressed. They're all walking around with patches from the mission, got the mission design on them and are very excited. But we'll have to bring them back another day.<br /></p><p>Q They were asking some good questions on their tour?<br /></p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, they're all good questions. I'm no expert by any means, but --no, it's a great program. And it's important we keep going, and keep our space program going. And this, of course, is a continuing part of that. We got to see a tour of the Atlantis, which is the next ship they're getting ready to launch. So at least we got to see that.<br /></p><pre>  Q     And you get to see NASCAR, right?    THE VICE PRESIDENT: And we get to see NASCAR.</pre><pre> That's the next stop.  </pre><pre> Will this be your first NASCAR race?  </pre><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: It will be, as a matter of fact, yes -- first time I've actually attended a race. I've been to tracks before, but it's the first time I've been to an actual race.<br /></p><p>Q Well, ride on Space Mountain and you get the Florida experience right there in one trip.<br /></p><pre>  THE VICE PRESIDENT:  All right, see you later.     Q     Thanks, Mr. Vice President.  </pre><pre>  THE VICE PRESIDENT:  You bet.     END        3:47 P.M. EDT </pre>

The injured crewman was taken to the airfield's <br />military hospital. No report was immediately available on his condition.<br /><br />Aircraft were responding to a reported rocket attack against Kandahar <br />Airfield when the Apache went down, officials said. No injuries were <br />reported from the rocket attack, the second in three days. A rocket attack <br />at the airfield June 30 left 10 people injured.<br /><br />The cause of the crash will be investigated, officials said, but enemy <br />fire has been ruled out as a cause for the aircraft's loss.<br /><br />&quot;We deeply regret the death of our superb pilot tonight,&quot; said Army <br />Maj. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley, commander of Combined Joint Task Force 76. <br />&quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and fellow <br />aviators of our dedicated soldier who lost his life tonight executing a <br />mission he believed in. His sacrifice will not be forgotten.<br /><br />&quot;We are thankful for the rapid response of our joint team who rescued <br />our injured pilot,&quot; the general continued. &quot;His rescue was heroic and <br />responsive. We are determined never to leave a fallen comrade, and our <br />well trained force demonstrated that tonight.&quot;<br /></p>

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;DaimlerChrysler's unique German-American makeup drives its leadership in the global motorsports arena</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;DaimlerChrysler is the only automobile company to have both a presence and heritage in Formula 1 and NASCAR racing </strong></p><p>Dr. Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of the Board of Management DaimlerChrysler AG (<a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&amp;PageName=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=DCX" target="_blank">NYSE:DCX</a>) and head of Mercedes Car Group told media here today that the company's strategic focus on global presence, leading brands and innovation has resulted in an unmatched presence, past and present, in motorsports around the world.<br /></p><p><br />&nbsp;</p><p>In a press briefing, Dr. Zetsche was joined by two leading players in motorsports: Ron Dennis, CEO and Chairman of the McLaren Group and team principle of the Team McLaren Mercedes Formula 1 team, and Ray Evernham, President and CEO of Evernham Motorsports. The discussion followed the previous evening's NASCAR Nextel Cup Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway and preceded Sunday's U.S. Grand Prix Formula 1 race in Indianapolis. At the media briefing, Zetsche, Dennis and Evernham discussed racing in general, and highlighted some of the sharing of technology and strategies between the Team McLaren Mercedes team and Evernham Motorsports Dodge NASCAR team.<br /></p><p>As a part of DaimlerChrysler's global racing network, Evernham Motorsports and the McLaren Group share information in areas such as how they measure critical performance in testing, their general simulation methods and organizational structure.<br /></p><p>According to Dr. Zetsche, &quot;Like the Mercedes Car Group and the Chrysler Group, Formula 1 and NASCAR are both unique and interrelated. Their similarities and differences, and success, mimic the unique makeup of DaimlerChrysler's management, product offering and racing programs. The fact that DaimlerChrysler is the only car-maker currently participating in Formula 1 and NASCAR demonstrates that our presence and history in global motorsports is unmatched. We intend to continue to leverage our unique German-American organization to be leaders in this arena.&quot;<br /></p><p>&quot;A great example of the synergy possibilities within DaimlerChrysler is found just 50 miles from here in Kokomo, Indiana,&quot; said Zetsche. &quot;The Indiana Transmission Plant II in Kokomo, produces a DaimlerChrysler 5-speed automatic transmission originally used in Mercedes-Benz vehicles that has now been engineered for use in the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Magnum and Jeep Commander and Grand Cherokee. We believe our unique German-American organization gives us an advantage in the marketplace.&quot; <br /></p><p><span class="label">Source: </span>DaimlerChrysler AG </p><p>&nbsp;</p><!---------------------------------->

                              <p>It wasn't easy, but Stuart Deane, a 34-year-old Australian currently living in Arlington, Texas, is the lone survivor in the Trump Million Dollar Invitational, defeating Gibby Martens, 25, of Scottsdale, Ariz., on the first playoff hole. Deane earned $1 Million, the largest payday of his career.<br /></p><p>&quot;I was extremely impressed with the way these guys played,&quot; said Donald Trump, who was on hand to provide commentary for ESPN and to hand Deane the $1 Million check. &quot;The U.S. Pro Golf Tour has some real talent and it showed in the way these players were able to conquer their fears and go for it when the big money was on the line.&quot;<br /></p><p>On the final hole, Deane had a five-foot putt for the win, but the ball rolled all the way around the cup and refused to fall, giving Martens new life. Back on the 18th tee, Martens' drive landed in high rough off the right side of the fairway, and when his approach landed short of the green, Deane was solid on his million-dollar putt.<br /></p><p>&quot;This is unbelievable and I don't really know what to say,&quot; stammered Deane, who's a regular on the U.S. Pro Golf Tour, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Greens Worldwide, Inc., a publicly traded sports marketing and management company.<br /></p><p>Deane was masterful at dodging million-dollar bullets the entire shootout round. On the first hole, he was involved in a putting skills challenge to determine which of the ten golfers would be eliminated. His putt fell well short of the hole, but when William McGirt's putt rolled slower than he thought, Deane advanced while McGirt went home in 10th place with $20,000.<br /></p><p>&quot;I was really hoping my gun wouldn't run out of bullets. I caught some breaks but I made some as well,&quot; Deane said. On 17, Deane was involved in another skills challenge from the greenside bunker. His ball landed eight feet from the hole and spun back 15 feet. While it looked like Deane was done, Anders Hultman's sand shot was shorter than Deane's and the Aussie moved on. Hultman settled for third and $90,000.<br /></p><p>As for what he'll do with the money, Deane said, &quot;What this will allow me to do is devote more time to becoming a better golfer and take the pressure off paying bills for awhile.&quot; But there is one indulgence set aside for the $1 Million winner: &quot;I'm a big automobile nut, so I'm going out and buying a great new car.&quot; He'll probably pay cash.<br /></p><p>The ten finalists in the Trump Million Dollar Invitational were all from the U.S. Pro Golf Tour. Finish and payout is as follows:<br /></p><pre>   1. Stuart Deane, Arlington, Tex. -- $1,000,000    2. Gibby Martens, Scottsdale, Ariz. -- $150,000    3. Anders Hultman, Irving, Tex. -- $90,000    4. Steve Friesen, Lincoln, Neb. -- $65,000    5. Alex Rodger, Ft. Worth, Tex. -- $45,000    6. Joe Lanza, Lafayette, Calif. -- $40,000    7. Kevin Streelman, Winfield, Ill. -- $35,000    8. Chad  Saladin, Gilbert, Ariz. -- $30,000    9. Chad Ginn, Alexandria, La.-- $25,000    10. William McGirt, Taylors, S.C.-- $20,000  </pre><p>The inaugural Trump Million Dollar Invitational was held at Trump International Golf Club at Raffles Resort Canouan Island. Donald Trump's first international venture, the course debuted in November 2004 with the opening of the luxurious Raffles Resort Canouan Island. It was named as Robb Report's &quot;Best of the Best&quot; in 2005.<br /></p><p>Trump International's well-earned reputation as the most picturesque and challenging course in the Caribbean attracted several celebrities. Competitors included actor Dennis Quaid; Adrian Young, the drummer of No Doubt; Olympic medallist Edwin Moses; baseball great Jose Alvarez; and Cincinnati Bengals' celebrated kicker, Jim Breech. In total, 85 members of the U.S. Pro Golf Tour participated. The Trump Million Dollar Invitational is a Major Championship of the U.S. Pro Golf Tour.<br /></p><p>The dramatic finish, along with all the action from the Trump Million Dollar Invitational, will re-air on ESPN2 on July 12, 2006, from 2:30-4:30 p.m. ET.<br /></p><p>The Trump Million Dollar Invitational is a production of Manhattan Beach, Calif.-based Innovative Media Solutions and Winnercomm, Inc. Title sponsors of the Trump Million Dollar Invitational include The Trump Organization, Canouan Resorts Development and Raffles Resort-Canouan Island. Presenting sponsor is TaylorMade-adidas. Official sponsors include Golf Digest, Golfsmith, Laser Link Golf, Peak Vision Sports and St. Vincent &amp; The Grenadines Ministry of Tourism and Culture.<br /></p><p>The event's web site is <a href="http://www.trumpmilliondollar.com/" target="_newbrowser">http://www.trumpmilliondollar.com/</a> .<br /></p><p>The U.S. Pro Golf Tour, International Golf Productions, LLC and IMS recently announced a five-year partnership with The Trump Organization. Beginning in 2007, four major championships of the USPGT will carry a total purse of $10.1 Million and will include the Trump World Match Play Challenge ($5 Million), the Trump Million Dollar Invitational ($1.6 Million), the Trump Celebrity Pro-Am ($1.5 Million) and the Trump Championship ($2 Million). Sites for the Trump Championships will be staged at four Trump golf courses, including Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach, Florida; Trump National, Westchester, New York; Trump National, Los Angeles; and Trump International, Canouan Island, The Grenadines</p>

The mission is to provide educational and life-enriching opportunities for disadvantaged youth.&nbsp; Paul&rsquo;s vision of the Fund is to ensure that opportunities are available for young people to recognize their dreams through mentoring programs, technology and other needs as well as fostering stable and safe environments.&nbsp; One of his long-term goals is to build a mentoring center in Inglewood, CA, where area youth can find life-changing educational tools and guidance.

The Foundation has since responded to the growing need to address all aspects of our youth&rsquo;s lives by expanding its mission. This expanded mission emphasizes the Foundation&rsquo;s focus on supporting community-based organization and development programs that serve the health, educational and social needs of those residing

They were reported to be in stable <br />condition.<br /><br />Combined Forces Command Afghanistan, as a matter of policy, does not <br />provide the nationality of its casualties in its initial announcements.<br /><br />&quot;This is a tragic loss,&quot; said a coalition spokesman, quoted in the news <br />release announcing the incident. &quot;These troops paid the ultimate price <br />for freedom, giving their lives so that others might live in a nation <br />free of tyranny and oppression. Our prayers go out to the families of <br />the deceased, and our thoughts are with those that were wounded in this <br />attack.&quot;<br /><br />Officials in Iraq announced that a soldier assigned to the 43rd <br />Military Police Brigade and an airman assigned to the 886th Expeditionary <br />Security Forces Squadron at Camp Bucca, Iraq, died yesterday in noncombat <br />incidents.<br /><br />The servicemembers' names are being withheld until their families are <br />notified.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Defense Department has identified six U.S. soldiers who <br />died recently, including one whose death is being investigated as a <br />possible &quot;friendly fire&quot; incident:<br /><br />- Pfc.

The <br />circumstances of the soldier's death are under investigation as a <br />possible friendly-fire incident, Defense Department officials said.<br />- Cpl. Jeremy S. Jones, 25, of Omaha, Neb., died June 27 of injuries <br />suffered from a roadside bomb detonation while on a dismounted combat <br />patrol in Baghdad. Jones was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 67th Armored <br />Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Hood, <br />Texas.<br />- Cpl. Aaron M.

Tanner. &quot;This memorial is <br />his way of giving something back to the United States, a country which <br />has given him so much love in his life. This memorial will be a place of <br />reflection for the families of the heroes that have given their lives.&quot;<br /><br />He said the memorial's board of directors plans to have the memorial <br />placed in a prominent area in Prince William County, Va., between <br />Quantico and Fort Belvoir. &quot;We're also planning a mobile memorial, which will <br />travel around the country.&quot;<br /><br />With room to etch up to 5,600 faces into the granite wall, Tanner said <br />the face of each serviceman and woman killed in the global war on <br />terrorism will be depicted with biographical information written below the <br />face.<br /><br />&quot;There will be faces to look at, not just names,&quot; he emphasized.<br /><br />Tanner said Roustazad wants the memorial to become a place for the <br />families of the fallen to reflect on the loss of their loved ones.<br /><br />&quot;We don't want to wait 20, 30 or 40 years to do it,&quot; said Dr. Jim <br />Thurman, the memorial's chairman of the board and chief executive officer. <br />&quot;We want this to be a living memorial. It took a long time to build the <br />Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and we don't want to wait that long.&quot;<br /><br />Reminding the audience that &quot;freedom is not free,&quot; Rev. C. Wesley <br />Conner, the event's keynote speaker, said Americans should try to remember <br />the men and women who have given their all, because America called them <br />to fight in this global war on terrorism.<br /><br />&quot;America's finest are fighting to maintain the security and the freedom <br />that we so richly enjoy, and, unfortunately, many times take for <br />granted,&quot; he said. &quot;Moreover, the global war on terrorism is a much different <br />kind of war than what the United States has ever fought. It also has <br />produced its share of casualties.&quot;<br /><br />He said the granite stone is going to be a worthy reminder for <br />generations to come of those who have given their all in the global war on <br />terrorism.<br /><br />&quot;The suffering has been theirs, the memories shall be ours,&quot; the <br />retired Army chaplain said. &quot;As long as American stands, we will never forget <br />the sacrifices of those who have gone before us and those who have <br />given their all.&quot;<br /><br />Noting that &quot;we have memorials to recall those who have given all,&quot; <br />Conner said Americans also can and must be willing to do something for the <br />men and women &quot;still serving on the frontiers of freedom.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;As a nation, we must pray for those whose lives are in danger,&quot; he <br />said.<br /><br />The pastor recalled the gratitude he felt from the letters he received <br />from people telling him they were praying for his welfare and his <br />safety while he was serving.<br /><br />&quot;We must pray for the troops and their friends and families left <br />behind,&quot; Conner said. &quot;Separation from loved ones is the No. 1 heartache in <br />every soldier's life - friends, finances, spouses, children, brothers <br />and sisters, mothers and fathers.&quot;<br /><br />Conner told of a deployed soldier's telephone conversation with his <br />5-year-old daughter. He said the girl asked her father, &quot;When are you <br />coming home Daddy?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He replied, 'It will be about six or seven more months, honey,'&quot; <br />Conner told the gathering at the candlelight vigil. &quot;She said, 'Daddy, is <br />that tomorrow?' His heart sank and he had to say, 'No, honey, that's not <br />tomorrow,'&quot; Conner said.<br />

                              <h2>Introduction</h2>Fireworks makers fill the night sky with myriad effects in displays that are popular all over the world. Although the art dates back to ancient China, most of the effects you'll see in a typical display are inventions of this century. A typical example is the development of coloured flames. Before the 19th century, only various yellows and oranges could be produced with steel and charcoal. Chlorates, an invention of the late 18th century and an industrial product of the 19th century, added basic reds and greens to the pyrotechnist's repertoire. Good blues and purples were not developed until this century, although it is not unusual to find unsafe display formulas for blue stars in earlier literature. <p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Basic principles of pyrotechnic light production</h2>The light emitters can be grouped into two main categories: solid state emitters (black body radiation) and gas phase emitters (molecules and atoms). <p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Black body radiation and the grey body concept</h3>A black body is an ideal emitter which is capable of absorbing and emitting all frequencies of radiation uniformly. The <em>excitance</em> (<em>M</em>) of the black body, the power emitted per unit area, is defined as <p>&nbsp;</p><pre>M = sT4                                                         (1) </pre>where <em>s </em>is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and <em>T</em> is the temperature. Thus, we could obtain a twofold increase in radiation by merely increasing the flame temperature from, say 2000 K to 2400 K. Furthermore, the radiation also shifts from infrared to visible light as the temperature increases. The calculated emission spectrum (the energy per unit volume per unit wavelength range) has the following shape: <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>In the real world, simplified models are not of much help. Many solids do emit light in the same relative proportions as a black body, but not in the same amounts. The <em>emissivity</em> of a solid substance is the factor relating observed and theoretical radiant energy. The emissivities of many refractory metals and metal oxides are higher in the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum - that is, they look bluer than expected when heated. <p>Table 1 gives a summary of visual temperature phenomena of solid bodies - for instance, a glowing piece of charcoal, a good approximation to the black body. </p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><pre>T, K	 oC	   Subjective colour  750	 480	   faint red glow 850	 580	   dark red 1000	 730       bright red, slightly orange 1200	 930	   bright orange 1400	 1100	   pale yellowish orange 1600	 1300	   yellowish white &gt; 1700    &gt; 1400     white (yellowish if seen from a distance) </pre><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><em>Table 1. The perceived colour of heated solid bodies. </em><em><p>&nbsp;</p></em><h4>The atomic and molecular emitters</h4>As you can easily see from Table 1 (and very probably know from experience), it is not possible to produce anything but shades of orange and yellow with grey-body emitters. (In principle, we could generate blue light with a hypothetical black or grey body at 9000 K and up, which is the temperature of blue stars, but such temperatures are unattainable for fireworkers.) For other colours, we need specific emitters of coloured light. <p>Surprisingly few emitters are used in pyrotechnics, given the vast range of atomic and especially molecular spectra available. In fact, the production of some colours is still a problem - next time you see a fireworks display, count all turquoises and ocean greens you saw. There are not many, because there are no commercially useful emitters available in the 490-520 nm region (blue-green to emerald green). </p><p>Table 2 summarises the sources of coloured light used in today's fireworks. </p><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><pre><strong>Colour          Emitters used                      Wavelength range</strong>   Yellow          Sodium D-line atomic emission 	    589 nm  Orange          CaCl, molecular bands               several bands, 591-                                                     599 nm, 603-608 nm                                                     being the most intense  Red	        SrCl, molecular bands	            a: 617-623 nm                                                      b: 627-635 nm                                                     c: 640-646 nm  Red	        SrOH(?), molecular bands	    600-613 nm  Green	        BaCl, molecular bands	            a: 511-515 nm                                                     b: 524-528 nm                                                     d: 530-533 nm  Blue	        CuCl, molecular bands	            403-456 nm,                                                     several intense                                                     bands, less intense                                                     bands between 460 nm                                                     and 530 nm </pre><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><em>Table 2. Sources of coloured light. </em><em><p>&nbsp;</p></em><h4>The chromaticity diagram and colour perception</h4>The human eye may not be the best spectroscope invented, but it is the best instrument for designing coloured fireworks. Although a spectroscope can show the presence or absence of certain lines or bands in the flame spectrum, it cannot decide whether the colour obtained looks pleasing to the human observer. Pure, monochromatic colours a'la lasers are only a dream for pyrotechnists, but well-designed impure colours do not lag much behind. <p>The chromaticity diagram shown below has been designed with human colour vision system (three base colours) in mind. It is not necessary to specify the intensities of all three base colours, because the hue is not affected by the brightness of the light (the sum of all intensities). We can conveniently use the fractional intensities of two primary colours, and this gives us a chart in two dimensions. The sum of all three intensities must equal one, so the third fraction can be easily calculated. </p><p>In order to avoid negative primary colour fractions, the International Commission on Illumination published a standard chromaticity diagram in 1931 with three unreal primary colours. The above diagram and the colours are based on the commission's recommendations. </p><p>The pure spectral colours can be found on the curved line surrounding the tongue-shaped region of composite colours. The numbers along the curve represent corresponding wavelengths (in nanometres). </p><p>Figure 2 shows the chromaticity diagram with a few emission lines and bands of Table 2 drawn on the curve of spectral colours. The colours of the diagram are only approximate. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All would be well if we could just pick up the light from the above emitters. However, the emitting molecules, especially SrCl and BaCl, are so reactive that they cannot be packed directly into a firework. To generate them, we need pyrotechnic compositions designed to generate the above molecules, to evaporate them into the flame and to keep them at as high temperature as possible to achieve maximum light output. To get good colours, there must be substantial amounts of emitters present in the flame. The emitters are not alone: in order to achieve the high temperature, a fuel - oxidiser system is also needed, as well as some additional ingredients. </p><p>The colours of aerial fireworks come invariably from stars, small pellets of firework composition which contain all the necessary ingredients for generating coloured light or other special effects. They may be as tiny as peas or as large as strawberries. A typical red star might contain </p><pre>Potassium perchlorate, 	67% by weight Strontium carbonate	13.5% Pine root pitch (fuel)	13.5% Rice starch (binder)	6% </pre><p>Care must be exercised in selecting the ingredients. The composition must be safe and stable in storage. In addition, it must work as expected and burn with a red colour once lit. For a deep red we need only SrCl and SrOH emission - and nothing else. To generate the emitting molecules at a sufficiently high temperature, a fuel-oxidiser system (pine root pitch - potassium perchlorate) is used. Strontium carbonate is used as the Sr source, and chlorine comes from potassium perchlorate (K<strong>Cl</strong>O4 --&gt; K+ +<strong>Cl-</strong> + 2 O2). An excess of fuel is used to prevent the formation of SrO, which would solidify in the flame and emit grey body radiation. This will result in a &quot;washed-out&quot; colour. Too much fuel would be a disadvantage, too, because the glowing carbon particles quickly overwhelm the red colour. </p><p>Pure colours also require pure ingredients. Sodium D-line atomic emission is so strong and so easily excited that even minute amounts of sodium impurities will quickly ruin the colours. Potassium, with its weak atomic lines, does not interfere with most colours, and potassium salts can usually be used. </p><p>Organic fuels, such as pine root pitch, various gums and rosins and synthetic resins, cannot generate as high temperatures as metallic fuels. The pyrotechnist is tempted to use powdered magnesium and aluminium for his/her brilliant stars, because they provide an easy method of raising the flame temperature and increasing the brightness. Unfortunately, the molecular emitters are quickly destroyed if the flame is too hot. CuCl is probably the most fragile colour emitter. It can be used with metallic fuels only with difficulty. Consequently, blue stars are never very bright. Another problem with metals are their oxidation products, metal oxides, which are powerful grey body radiators due to their refractory nature. Their incandescent glow can easily wash out all colours. </p><p>Over the years, chemists, amateur pyrotechnists and professional fireworkers have solved most of the problems of coloured flame production. Excellent formulations exist for yellow, orange, red, blue and green stars. The problem I've been working on is the production of deep forest green or ocean green. As you can see in Figure 3., there are no bands in that region (490 nm - 500 nm). A composite colour made of BaCl and CuCl emissions is an obvious choice, but unfortunately BaCl emission is seldom - if ever - free from interfering BaOH and BaO emissions, which fall in the yellow and yellowish-green region of the visible spectrum. It seems that it is easier to generate greenish blue and turquoise than the long sought after bluish green and forest green.</p><p>http://cc.oulu.fi/~kempmp/colours.html</p>

It says religion was not the reason for the rating</p><p>&nbsp;This incident raises the disquieting possibility that the MPAA considers exposure to Christian themes more dangerous for children than exposure to gratuitous sex and violence,&quot; Blunt said in a letter to MPAA Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dan Glickman. </p><p>After meeting with MPAA officials, Blunt and a handful of other House members said they remain concerned about the subjective native of the ratings process. </p><p>&quot;I'm not satisfied,&quot; said Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who attended the meeting with Blunt. &quot;We probably will want to revisit this ratings process to have some commonality in the standards that exist for movies, videos and video games.&quot; </p><p>Blackburn said she wants the House Energy and Commerce Committee to hold hearings on the issue later this year. </p><p>Blunt also brought up a recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health that found that the MPAA standards on sex and violence in movies have been getting weaker. </p><p>&quot;Mr. Blunt does continue to have questions about the process by which `Facing the Giants' was rated and what that says about ratings creep in general,&quot; spokeswoman Burson Taylor said Friday. </p><p><strong>An MPAA spokesman did not return calls seeking comment. But in a letter to Blunt in June, the MPAA's Glickman insisted the rating for &quot;Facing the Giants&quot; was not based on religious content. </strong></p><p><strong>&quot;Any strong or mature discussion of any subject matter results in at least a PG rating,&quot; Glickman said. &quot;This movie had a mature discussion about pregnancy, for example. It also had other mature discussions that some parents might want to be aware of before taking their kids to see this movie.&quot;</strong> </p><p><strong>A PG rating means parental guidance is suggested because the MPAA believes some material may not be suitable for children. A G rating means the MPAA has found the movie acceptable for all audiences. </strong></p><p><strong>Glickman said the movie's producers agreed with the rating and never appealed it. </strong></p><p><strong>The film's producers claim ratings officials changed their story after the controversy began. </strong></p><p><strong>&quot;The first communication from the MPAA was that religion was a factor in the ratings,&quot; said Kris Fuhr, vice president of marketing at Provident Films, which is owned by Sony Pictures. &quot;Since then, the MPAA has revised those factors to no longer include religion</strong>.&quot; </p><p>Fuhr says she is now satisfied with the rating and wants to move beyond the controversy to focus on marketing the film, billed as an inspirational drama about a high school football coach who relies on faith to battle fear and failure. </p><p>&quot;He dares to challenge his players to believe God for the impossible on and off the field,&quot; the movie's Web site says. </p><p>Facing the Giants&quot;: <a href="http://www.facingthegiants.com/">http://www.facingthegiants.com</a></p><p>Motion Picture Association of America: <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/">http://www.mpaa.org</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Las recientes leyes de inmigraci&oacute;n no resuelven a&uacute;n el problema real, y por tanto, no proporcionan resoluciones suficientes que respeten a la poblaci&oacute;n inmigrante&rdquo;, asegur&oacute; el Asamble&iacute;sta Ortiz. &ldquo;Esta visita a Arizona con mis colegas es importante, porque se est&aacute;n ignorando los derechos de una poblaci&oacute;n con t&aacute;cticas injustas que tienen el potencial de dividir las familias, e impactar en las contribuciones que hacen los inmigrantes a la econom&iacute;a de los Estados Unidos&rdquo;. <br /><br />Los legisladores estatales se reunir&aacute;n con Unidos en Arizona y The Human Rights Coalition/Indigenous Alliance Without Borders, entre otros grupos defensores de los derechos de los inmigrantes. <br /><br />El C&oacute;nclave Nacional Hispano de Legisladores Estatales (NHCSL) es una organizaci&oacute;n sin filiaci&oacute;n partidista que representa los intereses de los legisladores estatales hispanos de todos los estados, mancomunidades y territorios de los Estados Unidos. El NHCSL es un catalizador para acciones conjuntas sobre asuntos de inter&eacute;s comunes para todos los sectores de la comunidad hispana.

                              <strong><p></p></strong><strong><p>Kobayashi Overwhelming Favorite To Win Sixth Straight Mustard Yellow Belt </p></strong><p>&nbsp;The ultimate contest pitting man against frankfurter, Nathan's Famous Fourth of July International Hot Dog Eating Contest has been a staple on America's birthday since 1916. With the &quot;Super Bowl of competitive eating&quot; only days away, PinnacleSports.com today released odds on the world's most famous eating contest and lists reigning five-time champion, Takeru Kobayashi as an overwhelming favorite to successfully defend his title.</p><p>The largest sportsbook on the Internet, PinnacleSports.com has expanded its sports betting menu into the competitive eating arena by posting several betting options on the most intense 12 minutes of eating to be witnessed this year. The greatest eater in history and world record holder at the Nathan's event, Takeru Kobayashi has been installed as an overwhelming favorite at 1/3 odds (i.e., win $1 for every $3 bet) to capture the Mustard Yellow Championship Belt for the sixth straight year.</p><p>PinnacleSports.com believes Joey Chestnut, who devoured 50 hot dogs in qualifying, will present the biggest challenge to Kobayashi, listing him with the second-best odds to win the contest at 3/1. Sonya Thomas may appear slight in stature, but proved her bite is bigger than her bark with a second place finish in 2005 by devouring 37 dogs, and at 21/1 has the third best odds to win this year's event.</p><p>&quot;When people discuss individual dominance in sports they usually mention Lance Armstrong's seven Tour de France titles or Tiger Woods' 10 major championships, but Kobayashi's consecutive win streak at Coney Island is equally impressive,&quot; said Simon Noble of PinnacleSports.com. &quot;Although Joey Chestnut is having an amazing year on the competitive eating circuit and set a new American record with 50 hot dogs, it's unlikely he'll be able to unseat the great Kobayashi. Champions respond under pressure, and like Jordan and Elway before him, Kobayashi is the most clutch performer in eating history.&quot;</p><p>In addition to calculating odds on who'll win the contest, PinnacleSports.com has created several other betting options on the world's most prestigious eating competition. Although the oddsmakers favor the winner consuming at least 50 hot dogs and buns at 5/8 odds, they believe Kobayashi's world record of 53 1/2 frankfurters will be safe for at least another year, listing a new standard being set as a 9/4 underdog. Bettors may also wager on unique over/under lines on the number of hot dogs the three favorites will eat in this year's contest. The over/under line for Kobayashi's total has been set at 50 hot dogs and buns, while Chestnut's total is 45 and Thomas' has been set at 37.</p><p>PinnacleSports.com has also created unique match-ups between eaters participating in this year's event.

                              <p>&nbsp;</p><strong><p>Halfway through the games and approaching FIFA World Cup finals, error-free converged communication network from Avaya handles nine trillion bytes of data and voice transmission </p></strong><p>Handling everything from players' and journalists' accreditations, to transmitting photos and match details around the world in real time, the converged network from Avaya, an official partner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, achieved a halftime score that any football professional or fan would envy: a communication network that's free of errors, and thoroughly prepared for the final phase of the biggest sports event in the world.</p><p>Avaya Inc. (<a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&amp;PageName=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=AV"><u>NYSE:AV</u></a>) , a leading global provider of business communications applications, systems and services, is the official partner at the World Cup that pulls every player, every match, everything together with a champion communication network. The converged network -- which combines voice and data on the same infrastructure -- connects the 12 host stadiums, the stadium media centers in Munich, Berlin and Dortmund and the FIFA headquarters in Berlin. Players, coaches, volunteers and fans alike benefit from the network that is being used to issue accreditations for players and journalists, report results, track materials and inventory, confirm accommodations at FIFA's official hotels, and maintain security systems.</p><p>According to Avaya, at the halfway point in the tournament, the network has performed flawlessly and without any downtime, which is critical for a highly visible event such as the FIFA World Cup. For example, for the first 20 matches, the cumulative worldwide television viewing audience was almost 1.26 billion people. The total of voice and data bytes transferred over the network since it went &quot;live&quot; on June 1 is 9.8 terabytes (or 9.8 trillion bytes of traffic). The average amount of traffic transmitted on Avaya network each day during the FIFA World Cup is 250,000 gigabytes. People have logged onto the converged communications network approximately 567,000 times, to date, and over 296,000 phone calls have been made on the network, which represents 632,297 minutes of calling time.</p><p>Thousands of people have been using the high-speed Wireless LAN access from Avaya that have made connectivity easy and convenient for staff working temporarily in an area of the stadium or FIFA Headquarters Hotel. Journalists and photographers working in the stadiums can quickly connect to the Internet via an Avaya wireless LAN network and send photos and stories directly from the field.</p><p>&quot;Whether it's our team of Avaya technical experts or the team of players on the field, the same rules apply: excellent preparation is critical to success,&quot; said Andrea Rinnerberger, director of the Avaya FIFA World Cup Program. &quot;For months, the network Avaya built for the FIFA World Cup underwent rigorous testing in configuration, fail-over and resiliency. You might say we were in 'intensive training' for the tournament. Achieving 99.99% network availability and reliability to date is the result of these high-powered IT 'workouts' that enable us to be fully ready for the expected and unexpected.&quot;</p><p>The unexpected arrived for the Avaya team of technicians working at a match at the FIFA World Cup stadium in Munich when Argentine football legend Diego Maradona ducked into the stadium's technical center to escape autograph seekers, and found himself surrounded by blinking monitors and racks of media servers and gateways that comprise the network Avaya built for FIFA. After his -- and the Avaya team's -- initial surprise, the former football star was introduced to the world of high technology, with a tour of the network that Avaya deployed.</p><p>&quot;It's a 'World Cup moment,' but it illustrates Avaya's dedication to being prepared for anything and everything,&quot; Rinnerberger said. &quot;We bring the same dedication to the enterprise customers we serve around the world.&quot;</p><p>About Avaya:</p><p>Avaya Inc. designs, builds and manages communications networks for more than one million businesses worldwide, including over 90 per cent of the FORTUNE 500(R). Focused on businesses large to small, Avaya is a world leader in secure and reliable Internet Protocol telephony systems and communications software applications and services.</p><p>Driving the convergence of voice and data communications with business applications -- and distinguished by comprehensive worldwide services -- Avaya helps customers leverage existing and new networks to achieve superior business results.

USA Certification Center undergoing testing for compliance with EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and DOT (Department of Transportation) regulations. </p><p>This is a major step in Rodedawg's marketing which envisions worldwide promotion, sales and distribution of the amphibious 4X4 off-road vehicle called ''Rodedawg.'' The company owns the trademark rights in the US and in many other countries around the globe for this purpose. </p><p>The Rodedawg is currently available in other markets in the three different configurations, truck, SUV and soft top convertible. All three models have been delivered to the USA Certification Center with the soft top model being targeted as the first to undergo the compliances for the US market. </p><p>Luis Pallais, Chairman and CEO of Rodedawg, stated, &quot;The certification of the Rodedawg is currently underway and this process will allow us as a company to market and sell this incredible vehicle throughout the United States. This will be a very important market for our vehicles.&quot; He added, &quot;In anticipation of receiving certification we have begun the process of scouting for a location to establish our initial US showroom. Thus far locations in Florida, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada are being considered.&quot; </p><p>The Rodedawg, which is both land and water capable, is new to the worldwide civilian market, having been extensively and successfully used by the Chinese military for many years. The Rodedawg brings a new niche in the marketplace as a mass-produced amphibious, off-road 4x4 vehicle. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><div style="font-size: xx-small; float: left; text-align: center" align="left"><table cellspacing="8" cellpadding="0" width="130" border="0"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><table bordercolor="#cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="130" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" width="130" border="0"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#e5e5ef"><div align="center"><strong>Highlighted Links</strong> </div></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.marketwire.com/mw/frame_multimedia?prid=140913&amp;attachid=290208" target="_blank">Rodedawg </a><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Rodedawg's adaptability provides a wide range of usefulness in both work and recreational activities, e.g. a security vehicle patrolling and cruising the Rio Grande River bordering Mexico and the US or a land and water emergency rescue vehicle. There is an array of recreational uses of the Rodedawg for those who enjoy outdoor adventures, exploring, boating, rugged trails, hunting, fishing, etc. </p><p>Pallais remarked, &quot;This marvelous, adaptable vehicle doesn't have any real competition because a $70,000 boat will not perform on land, and a $120,000 vehicle, like the 'Hummer H1,' will not float on water. The best news of all is the Rodedawg will have a base price in some markets of about $50,000 US dollars.&quot; </p><p>Individuals with feedback or interest in purchasing the vehicle or being a sales agent or dealer can call 1-800-793-0355, or email <a href="http://montebubbles.net/ym/montebubbles.net/Compose?To=info@rodedawg.com" target="_blank">info@rodedawg.com</a>. </p><p>For Rodedawg International Industries investor relations, investors should visit Rodedawg's IR Hub at <a href="http://www.agoracom.com/IR/Rodedawg" target="_blank">http://www.agoracom.com/IR/Rodedawg</a> where they can post questions for same-day answers, or simply review questions and answers posted by other investors.

                              <h4>PrintingForLess.com, the first and largest online commercial printer in the United States, knows a few things about the challenges of building a growing company in a small, Western community. Today, the successful Montana-based company welcomed nearly 500 people to its brand new facility to focus on the challenges and opportunities in developing a stronger economy statewide. </h4><p>PrintingForLess.com's Grand Opening event drew a diverse gathering of area business owners, community leaders and local guests for tours, forum discussions and a catered lunch at the new 46,500 square-foot facility at the edge of Livingston, best known as the northern gateway to Yellowstone National Park. The event highlighted not only the completion of the largest commercial facility in the county since the town's railroad boom days, but also the need for ongoing collaborative efforts to improve Montana's economic landscape. </p><p>&quot;Economic development is so vital to this state,&quot; said Senator Conrad Burns. &quot;Brainstorming opportunities such as this Grand Opening are important in helping everyone to think outside of the box, as PrintingForLess.com has done, to find innovative ways to create quality new jobs.&quot; </p><p>Burns was a panelist on a forum on Economic Development along with Chief Montana Business Development Officer Evan Barrett, Greg Gianforte of RightNow Technologies, Justin Bigart of Sage Salon Living who co-founded the Montana Jobs Network, and Russ Fletcher of the Montana Associated Technology Roundtables. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><div style="font-size: xx-small; float: left; text-align: center" align="left"><table cellspacing="8" cellpadding="0" width="130" border="0"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><table bordercolor="#cccccc" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="130" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" width="130" border="0"><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#e5e5ef"><div align="center"><strong>Highlighted Links</strong> </div></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.marketwire.com/mw/frame_multimedia?prid=141044&amp;attachid=290443" target="_blank">PrintingForLess.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.marketwire.com/mw/frame_multimedia?prid=141044&amp;attachid=290444" target="_blank">About PrintingForLess.com</a><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>PrintingForLess.com's expansion into its new manufacturing and office facility makes room for continued job creation at what is Park County's largest for-profit employer with 145 employees. The company plans to hire at least 40 additional people this year. </p><p>PFL's growing pains in the area of leadership development in recent years prompted the focus on this crucial topic at the Grand Opening's afternoon forum. The company's CEO and founder, Andrew Field, moderated the forum on leadership development and the challenges of leading an organization in the midst of rapid growth. The distinguished panel of business and academic leaders shared their perspectives on how to develop the people and mindset for effective leadership. </p><p>&quot;A key factor in successfully leading and building an organization is how well you develop the culture,&quot; said Dr. Richard Semenik, Dean of the College of Business at Montana State University. &quot;A culture of commitment and shared sense of purpose is often the critical ingredient when you have limited resources in a growing enterprise.&quot; </p><p>Many of the features of PFL's new state-of-the art facility were designed around the company's team-based culture and goal of becoming &quot;America's Print Shop,&quot; the first national brand in commercial printing. The company also designed it to be a healthful, inspiring space for employees. The environmentally friendly building is both highly energy-efficient and built for employee comfort with features such as radiant floor heating, a humidification system and sound absorption through a recycled product called tectum, made from Aspen trees. </p><p>Guests at today's Grand Opening event who toured the facility were taken aback by its spaciousness and the view from a wall of windows looking out at the Absaroka Mountains in Paradise Valley. The beautiful scenery and clean, high-tech environment was a backdrop to the circuitry of interactions among those in attendance. </p><p>&quot;Our celebration today provided a rare opportunity for our fellow businesses and community members to network together and gain insights from knowledgeable leaders,&quot; said Andrew Field, CEO and President of PrintingForLess.com. &quot;We have learned so much from our friends and community over the years, it was nice to be able to give back.&quot; </p><p>A list and bios of forum panelists are available online at: <a href="http://www.pflgrandopening.com/panelmemberbios.html" target="_blank">http://www.pflgrandopening.com/panelmemberbios.html</a> </p><p>About PFL </p><p>PrintingForLess.com (<a href="http://www.printingforless.com/" target="_blank">www.PrintingForLess.com</a>) is the first and leading online commercial printing company with more than 60,000 small- to mid-sized business customers throughout the United States.

                              <strong><p></p></strong><strong><p>- Atari's Award-Winning 'Super DBZ' Fighter Set for July Launch on PlayStation(R)2 - </p></strong><p>Atari, Inc. (<a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&amp;PageName=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=ATAR"><u>NASDAQ:ATAR</u></a>) today announced that development is complete on Super Dragon Ball Z(R) for the PlayStation(R)2 computer entertainment system. Developed by former Street Fighter II producer Noritaka Funamizu's new studio, Crafts &amp; Meister, Super DBZ delivers a more &quot;hard core&quot; fighting experience, complete with unique and lightening-quick combos for each character, and the ability to steal combos from other players. Relying on a game engine that rewards fast reflexes and features the ability to string together a multitude of combos, the game's levels have been created in the art style of Akira Toriyama, the original creator of the Dragon Ball manga.</p><p>&quot;Atari pushes the envelope with this DBZ video game. Super DBZ offers more challenging and intense fighting gameplay to fans than ever before,&quot; said Emily Anadu, Product Manager, Atari, Inc. &quot;As evidenced by the talent that made the game, Super DBZ provides a more hard-core 3D fighting experience but still remains loyal to the DBZ brand -- down to the environments which were created to look like the original Dragon Ball Z manga.&quot;</p><p>Each of the 13 characters and 5 unlockable secret characters in the game, including DBZ superheroes Goku, Gohan and Vegeta, are taken straight from the world of DBZ and have their own catalog of unique special attacks and fighting styles that are faithful to the series. Super DBZ will also feature Cyborg Frieza, an all new character never seen before in the Dragon Ball universe.</p><p>Super DBZ has already captured critical acclaim. The title earned a &quot;GameDaily Nod&quot; at this year's E3 and was a runner-up for IGN.com's E3 2006 &quot;Best PS2 Fighting Game.&quot;</p><p>Dragon Ball Z video games are the leading anime-based video games, with more than 10 million units sold since May 2002.

                              <strong><p>&nbsp;</p></strong><strong><p>Publisher Jim Baen Dies at Age 62 </p></strong><p>Science fiction publishing visionary Jim Baen passed away on June 28th. He suffered a massive stroke on June 12, 2006, and never woke from it. Jim Baen was a founding partner of Baen Books, one of the largest independent publishers of popular fiction. Since its inception in 1984, Baen evolved to be one of the leading publishers of science fiction and fantasy, and in recent years a leader in electronic publishing and the fight against encrypted books.</p><p>Jim Baen started his career in publishing in the complaints department of Ace Books. He moved on to Galaxy magazine in 1973, where his editorial acumen turned the magazine into one of the leading short story venues of the day. He returned to Ace under publisher Tom Doherty to run the science fiction line. When Doherty left to found Tor Books, Jim went with him and established its science fiction line, purchasing its first 170 titles. In 1984 a deal with Simon &amp; Schuster/Pocket Books gave Jim a chance to found his own independent company. S&amp;S has distributed Baen Books ever since. Recently, Baen Books has enjoyed a string of New York Times bestsellers by such authors as David Weber, John Ringo and Eric Flint. Jim also personally worked with Jerry Pournelle, David Drake, Larry Niven, Charles Sheffield, Lois McMaster Bujold and many other authors who shaped the field of modern science fiction. In recent years, Jim continued to develop a whole new generation of science fiction writers.</p><p>Jim Baen was a personal and vocal champion of unencrypted ebooks. The Baen Books Webscriptions program is a model in the field, and the discussion board at <a href="http://www.baen.com/"><u>http://www.baen.com/</u></a>, &quot;Baen's Bar,&quot; is an active forum and thriving online community. Jim's piquant wit and incisive commentary will be sorely missed.</p><p>Jim is survived by two daughters, Jessica Baen, 29, and Katherine Baen, 14.</p><p>The surviving partners of Baen and his heirs intend to continue Jim's legacy of innovative, independent publishing. Longtime Baen Books executive editor Toni Weisskopf will be acting publisher and direct day-to-day operation of the company. Remembrances of Jim's life will be held at Trinoc*coN in Raleigh, NC, Sunday, July 16 and L.A.con IV, the Worldcon, in Los Angeles, CA in August. A memorial service will also be held in New York in late summer.</p><p>For a complete obituary please go to author David Drake's website: <a href="http://www.david-drake.com/"><u>http://www.david-drake.com/</u></a> .</p><p>Source: Baen Books </p><p>Web site: <a href="http://www.baen.com/"><u>http://www.baen.com/</u></a> <br /><a href="http://www.david-drake.com/"><u>http://www.david-drake.com/</u></a> </p>

                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p>After three quarters of declining market share and the loss of its leadership in the plasma display panel (PDP) industry, South Korea&rsquo;s LG Electronics reclaimed the top position in Q1, according to El Segundo, Calif.-based iSuppli Corp. </p><p>LG&rsquo;s share of worldwide PDP unit production rose to 31.1 percent in Q1, up from 27.5 percent in Q4 2005, putting the company about 1 percentage point ahead of Japan&rsquo;s Matsushita, which controlled 25.9 percent of factory units during Q1. LG last held the top spot in Q1 2005.</p><p>&ldquo;LG&rsquo;s rise in market share is due to its capacity additions and the resulting increase in panel output,&rdquo; said Riddhi Patel, senior analyst with iSuppli Corp. in a statement. &ldquo;This development reflects a long-term trend of the South Korean PDP suppliers advancing at the expense of their Japanese and Taiwanese rivals.&rdquo;</p><p>In Q1, South Korean suppliers LG and Samsung SDI collectively accounted for 54.5 percent of PDP unit shipments, compared to 40.5 percent in Q1 2004.</p><p>LG and number three PDP supplier Samsung SDI not only are increasing capacity, but also improving the quality of their panels and focusing on cost reduction, both at the component and at the production levels, the firm said. The two South Korean suppliers are migrating to larger fab sizes in order to cut more panels from each mother glass.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the Korean suppliers increase their capacity, Japanese players are losing ground in PDP production, iSuppli found.</p><p>Matsushita is the only Japanese company that is keeping pace with the South Korean players in terms of capacity expansions, while the Taiwanese players are actually exiting the market because they are not seeing much technology transfer from their partners and thus are finding it hard to keep up with the intense competition, the firm noted.</p><p>Profitability has been challenging for the majority of the PDP makers, despite rising consumer uptake of plasma TV sets. Beyond lack of profitability, multiple factors are driving consolidation in the market, including swiftly declining panel prices, slower sales growth and increasing competition with alternative technologies in the large-screen TV market, iSuppli said.</p><p>These factors caused Taiwan&rsquo;s CPT and Formosa to drop out of the PDP business, leaving the market with only five major suppliers. </p><p>In other market consolidation developments, Pioneer Corp. last year acquired NEC Corp.&rsquo;s PDP business. Furthermore, Fujitsu Ltd. decided to relinquish its majority stake in Fujitsu Hitachi Plasma Display Ltd. (FHP), in favor of Hitachi Ltd., in order to achieve profitability. </p><p>Despite increasing competition from LCD sets, consumers continue to be attracted to plasma TVs because of their slim form factor, their rapidly declining prices and their widespread availability. The 42-inch Enhanced Definition (ED) plasma is the cheapest way to own a large-sized flat-panel TV. Prices for these sets start as low as $1,200.</p><p>The 42-inch XGA PDP models also are becoming attractive to consumers because of declining prices, and the 50-inch is not far behind. These TVs are available for as low as $1,900, making them very attractive to consumers, the firm believes.</p><p>But despite their wow factor, plasma TVs are facing stiff competition from LCD TVs in the 40- to 44-inch range, whose production is rising rapidly.<br />With seventh-generation and 7.5-generation fabs going online during the next couple of years, the LCD panel makers will be able to reduce the production costs of 40-/42-inch panels to match plasma. Because of the sheer scale of their production capacities, the LCD suppliers will be fully capable of having a big impact on plasma in its dominant size range by the 2008 to 2009 timeframe.</p><p>The short-term forecast for plasma is aggressive, as the industry tries to capture maximum share while LCD-TVs remain the more expensive alternative, iSuppli concluded. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong>TOP-SEVEN PLASMA DISPLAY PANEL MANUFACTURER RANKING</strong> <br />(percentage of unit shipments)<br /><table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" width="100%" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p align="center"><strong>Q1 2006 Rank</strong></p></td><td><p align="left"><strong>Company</strong></p></td><td><p align="center"><strong>Q1 2004</strong></p></td><td><p align="center"><strong>Q2 2004</strong></p></td><td><p align="center"><strong>Q3 2004</strong></p></td><td><p align="center"><strong>Q4 2004</strong></p></td><td><p align="center"><strong>Q1 2005</strong></p></td><td><p align="center"><strong>Q2 2005</strong></p></td><td><p align="center"><strong>Q3 2005</strong></p></td><td><p align="center"><strong>Q4 2005</strong></p></td><td><p align="center"><strong>Q1 2006</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center">1</p></td><td><p align="left">LG Electronics</p></td><td><p align="center">18.4%</p></td><td><p align="center">21.5%</p></td><td><p align="center">23.8%</p></td><td><p align="center">23.1%</p></td><td><p align="center">29.3%</p></td><td><p align="center">25.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">25.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">27.5%</p></td><td><p align="center">31.0%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center">2</p></td><td><p align="left">Matsushita</p></td><td><p align="center">17.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">21.4%</p></td><td><p align="center">19.1%</p></td><td><p align="center">19.0%</p></td><td><p align="center">19.5%</p></td><td><p align="center">24.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">25.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">28.0%</p></td><td><p align="center">25.9%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center">3</p></td><td><p align="left">Samsung SDI</p></td><td><p align="center">22.1%</p></td><td><p align="center">21.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">24.3%</p></td><td><p align="center">26.4%</p></td><td><p align="center">29.2%</p></td><td><p align="center">27.9%</p></td><td><p align="center">27.5%</p></td><td><p align="center">27.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">23.5%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center">4</p></td><td><p align="left">Pioneer</p></td><td><p align="center">16.2%</p></td><td><p align="center">10.9%</p></td><td><p align="center">12.8%</p></td><td><p align="center">13.1%</p></td><td><p align="center">11.6%</p></td><td><p align="center">11.8%</p></td><td><p align="center">10.9%</p></td><td><p align="center">9.4%</p></td><td><p align="center">11.2%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center">5</p></td><td><p align="left">Hitachi Ltd.</p></td><td><p align="center">23.3%</p></td><td><p align="center">22.0%</p></td><td><p align="center">17.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">16.0%</p></td><td><p align="center">8.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">8.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">9.1%</p></td><td><p align="center">6.8%</p></td><td><p align="center">8.3%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center">6</p></td><td><p align="left">CPT</p></td><td><p align="center">1.1%</p></td><td><p align="center">1.2%</p></td><td><p align="center">1.1%</p></td><td><p align="center">1.3%</p></td><td><p align="center">1.2%</p></td><td><p align="center">1.1%</p></td><td><p align="center">0.9%</p></td><td><p align="center">0.7%</p></td><td><p align="center">0.0%</p></td></tr><tr><td><p align="center">7</p></td><td><p align="left">Formosa</p></td><td><p align="center">1.2%</p></td><td><p align="center">1.4%</p></td><td><p align="center">1.2%</p></td><td><p align="center">1.2%</p></td><td><p align="center">0.5%</p></td><td><p align="center">0.2%</p></td><td><p align="center">0.2%</p></td><td><p align="center">0.0%</p></td><td><p align="center">0.0%</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br />SOURCE: ISUPPLI CORP.

                              recognizing companies like Microsoft, Activision and Ubisoft for their efforts on behalf of their premium titles. <p class="body">The award is named after Senet, thought by archeologists to be the oldest game in the world, enjoyed by the pre-dynastic kings of ancient Egypt, as early as 3500 B.C. It's hard to deny the classical and archaic appeal of the AEIM's choice of monikers, but the games they are lauding today have an important and vivid difference from the games of yesteryear--a distinction that is very significant to marketers looking to have their brands appear in games. </p><p class="body">Beginning in the early 80s, game designers began to become increasingly interested in the concept of &quot;immersion.&quot; Games played on consoles and computers were becoming less abstract--less like chess, which has no characters, no setting, and no story, to speak of, and more like games of make-believe, where players took on a new persona, acquired new abilities, and were encouraged to think and feel as someone else entirely. It is this concept, and not all the technological and graphical bells and whistles, that chiefly separates the games of today from the board games, dice games and card games that people play offline. </p><p class="body">Game developers today seek to immerse players in the game worlds they create, emotionally, visually, and intellectually: Players of modern console and PC games can perceive, think, and feel as another person, becoming totally absorbed in the gameplay experience. Don't believe it? Pick up a copy of &quot;Half-Life,&quot; praised as one of the modern pioneers of immersion. </p><p class="body">Released in 1998, &quot;Half-Life&quot; put players in the role of Gordon Freeman, a nerdy nuclear physicist turned alien-battling commando. &quot;Half-Life&quot; was at the cusp of technology where the processing power of PCs was just beginning to support highly detailed and realistic game environments, and the designers of the game decided to make the whole game continuous--no stops, no cut-scenes, no fast-forwards--which deeply involved players in the experience of the game. The gameplay was fast-paced and exciting, and included puzzles that required both tactical and critical thinking, immersing players in every way. </p><p class="body">Now, that kind of immersion is what nearly all big-name game developers aim for. Marketers, when choosing how to present their brands in-game, can help or harm the level of immersion, which will have an enormous effect on how their messages are received. When a player's character walks down the street of a modern city in-game, and all the cars are generic, look-alike vehicles, rather than actual name brands, immersion takes a tiny hit, as players are forced to suspend their disbelief just a little. </p><p class="body">If car companies get onboard with game designers and allow their brands to be used, the developers are happy with a more realistic cityscape in their games, the players are happy with a more immersive game experience, and the brands are happy for the exposure. </p><p class="body">On the flip side, brands in games can just as easily hurt immersion. If, in the abovementioned cityscape, all the brand-name cars are indestructible--a common practice in racing games that use real cars, since automakers rarely wish to see their prize models reduced to flaming wrecks--the player must disbelieve more, and immerse less. </p><p class="body">Either way, when a brand helps immersion--or hurts it--players will notice. And they will remember</p>

In late fall 2005, Epicurean International Products unveiled its revolutionary series of professional-style, automated vacuum and pressure seal pumps with uniquely designed stoppers, including the <strong>Epicurean Wine Saver</strong>, the <strong>Epicurean Rechargeable Wine Saver</strong> and <strong>the Epicurean Combination Wine and Champagne Saver</strong>. </p><p>Anthony Lemme, Founder and President of Epicurean International Corp., the predecessor of Epicurean International Products, LLC, established in 1990, has spent a lifetime devoted to overcoming the challenges of protecting wine and champagne from deteriorating once opened. An expert in wine preservation, Mr. Lemme introduced the first handheld Vacuum Resealing System (Vacu-Vin) in the U.S., as well as several<u> </u>Anthony Lemme, Founder and President of Epicurean International Corp., the predecessor of Epicurean International Products, LLC, established in 1990, has spent a lifetime devoted to overcoming the challenges of protecting wine and champagne from deteriorating once opened. An expert in wine preservation, Mr. Lemme introduced the first handheld Vacuum Resealing System (Vacu-Vin) in the U.S., as well as several other countries in 1987 through 1989. Highly successful, the Vacu-Vin achieved more than $5,000,000 in sales during this timeframe. Mr. Lemme followed this breakthrough product launch with the development of his patented Epivac System, the world&rsquo;s first changeable combination Vacuum and Pressure Pump, as well as the Epivac Wine and Champagne Stoppers. </p><p>During the period of 1988 through 2002, the Vacu-Vin and Epivac Systems of handheld vacuum resealers were the top selling brands worldwide with estimated combined sales in excess of 30 million units. Mr. Lemme conservatively estimates that current sales of handheld pumps average more than 2 million units per year.Following years of research and development, Mr. Lemme and his company proudly introduce the most technologically advanced, all-natural method to preserving wines with greater ease, speed and convenience. The new easy-to-use, high performance plug-in and rechargeable <strong>Epicurean Wine Savers</strong> expertly seal opened bottles of wine in just seconds, and preserve wine&rsquo;s optimum taste, color and aroma for&nbsp;up<u> </u>to 14 days longer than corked open bottles. Additionally, the technologically advanced <strong>Epicurean Wine Savers </strong>&ndash; engineered with five patent-pending features -- offer a perfectly controlled and efficient method to preserving wines, compared to manual hand-pump vacuum sealers and gas systems, which require greater effort and no way to know when the bottle has been properly sealed, leading to hastened oxidation and deterioration. </p><p>According to Mr. Lemme, the uniquely advantageous <strong>Epicurean Wine Savers </strong>and<strong> </strong>the<strong> Epicurean Combination Wine and Champagne Saver</strong> (priced at $59.99 to $119.95 suggested retail) are well poised to generate extensive interest and demand from professional sommeliers and bartenders, as well as discerning consumers and wine connoisseurs. </p><p>&ldquo;Our new products<strong> </strong>offer the world&rsquo;s most advanced, affordable, all-natural, reusable and convenient system of preserving wine and champagne,&rdquo; says Mr. Lemme. &ldquo;Until now, the only viable alternative to hand pump sealers required either the unappealing introduction of nitrogen or argon gas, or the investment of thousands of dollars for a very heavy, bulky, stationary and awkward to use electric seal pump.&rdquo;</p><p>Leveraging a growing passion for wine among consumers in the U.S., as well as a robust wine market globally, Epicurean International Products, LLC is marketing its new advanced <strong>Epicurean Wine Savers </strong>and<strong> Epicurean Combination Wine and Champagne Saver</strong> to upscale consumer and restaurant trade channels in America and other key countries worldwide. </p><p>The company&rsquo;s two new <strong>Epicurean Wine Savers</strong>,<strong> </strong>and the <strong>Epicurean Combination Wine and Champagne Saver</strong> are available now at select gourmet and specialty stores nationwide. </p><p>For further information, consumers are welcomed to visit the company&rsquo;s web site, <u>www.epicurean-int.com</u>, or call toll-free 1-866-229-2907</p>

                              <strong><p>&nbsp;</p></strong><strong><p>Only Three Percent of Current Mobile Users Have Used the Video Clip Messaging Service </p></strong><p>Wireless Service Providers apparently are not convincing subscribers to send pictures and videos with their cell phone. Among mobile users 39 percent have used text messaging; less than half that number, or 18 percent have sent pictures, and only three percent have tried sending video clips. Over half (58%) of mobile users state they have not used any of these services.</p><p>What's wrong?</p><p>Surprisingly, cost is not the biggest obstacle to using these services, as only 19 percent of those who say they do not use any of the services cite that as a reason. Interestingly, the majority (73%) of those who have not used these services just don't see a need to.</p><p>&quot;The ability to send pictures and videos over your cell phone is a lot like owning a pet rock,&quot; states Joe Porus, Chief Architect and Vice President for the Technology Practice at Harris Interactive(R). &quot;At first it might seem like a good idea, but then the 'why?' enters your mind. Wireless marketers are facing a brick wall of resistance from many subscribers respecting these services. The wall is not cost, but a more fundamental question of need.&quot;</p><p>Below are some of the results of the Harris Interactive Summer 2006 Telecommunications Report titled &quot;Hot Issues Facing the Industry.&quot; The study was conducted online from May 1 to May 8, 2006 by Harris Interactive among 1,332 U.S. adults, of whom 960 are current mobile phone users.</p><p>Who's using messaging services?</p><p>When it comes to the use of text and picture messaging, text messaging is used substantially more by users aged 18 to 39, compared to their older counter parts. While about one-third (32%) of young people use picture messaging, more than two-thirds (69%) of mobile users 18 to 39 years use text- messaging services. Contrastingly, only 35 percent of mobile users aged 40 to 54 have used text messaging. An even smaller number (13%) of them have used picture messaging. This number decreases even more with mobile users aged 55 and over, with 14 percent use text messaging and only eight percent using picture messaging.</p><p>Most notable is the lack of the video messaging use, which is substantially low across the board in all age groups. Very small percentages of younger adults have not used this service with only four percent of those aged 18 to 39 saying they have used video clip messaging, and only two percent of adults ages 40 to 54 and those aged 55 and older stating they have used this service.</p><p>Why are mobile users not using these services?</p><p>There are several factors that may impact a decision to use these services, but the majority just does not see a need (73%). Other factors such as cost (19%), lack of knowledge (14%), played a slightly smaller role. Others say the services are too complicated (8%) or say there was some &quot;other&quot; (5%) reason.</p><p>TABLE 1A</p><p>WHAT SERVICES ARE BEING USED</p><p>&quot;Which of the following messaging services have you used?&quot;</p><p>Base: Current mobile phone user</p><p>Total</p><p>%</p><p>SMS (text messaging) 39</p><p>Picture messaging (sending a photo with or without text) 18</p><p>Video clip messaging 3</p><p>None of these 58</p><p>Note: Multiple response question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TABLE 1B</p><p>WHAT SERVICES ARE BEING USED- BY AGE</p><p>&quot;Which of the following messaging services have you used?&quot;</p><p>Base: Current mobile phone user</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Total 18-39 40-54 55+</p><p>% % % %</p><p>SMS (text messaging) 39 69 35 14</p><p>Picture messaging (sending a</p><p>photo with or without text) 18 32 13 8</p><p>Video clip messaging 3 4 2 2</p><p>None of these 58 29 61 84</p><p>Note: Multiple response question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TABLE 2</p><p>FACTORS AFFECTING USE OF SERVICES</p><p>&quot;Why have you not used any of the messaging services?&quot;</p><p>Base: Don't use messaging services</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Total</p><p>%</p><p>Cost 19</p><p>Just don't see the need 73</p><p>Too complicated 8</p><p>I don't know much about it 14</p><p>Other 5</p><p>Note: Multiple response question.</p><p>Methodology</p><p>This online survey was conducted online within the United States between May 1 to 8, 2006 among 1,332 adults (aged 18 and over). Sub-samples are listed in the tables above. Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was also used to adjust for respondents' propensity to be online.</p><p>All surveys are subject to several sources of error. These include: sampling error (because only a sample of a population is interviewed); measurement error due to question wording and/or question order, deliberately or unintentionally inaccurate responses, nonresponse (including refusals), interviewer effects (when live interviewers are used) and weighting.</p><p>With one exception (sampling error) the magnitude of the errors that result cannot be estimated. There is, therefore, no way to calculate a finite &quot;margin of error&quot; for any survey and the use of these words should be avoided.</p><p>With pure probability samples, with 100 percent response rates, it is possible to calculate the probability that the sampling error (but not other sources of error) is not greater than some number. With a pure probability sample of 1,332 adults one could say with a ninety-five percent probability that the overall results have a sampling error of +/-3 percentage points. Sampling error for sub-sample results would be higher and varied. However that does not take other sources of error into account. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no theoretical sampling error can be calculated.</p><p>These statements conform to the principles of disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls.</p><p>About Harris Interactive</p><p>Harris Interactive is the 13th largest and fastest-growing market research firm in the world.

Dr. Hamid will talk about his past involvement with this terrorist group, and how he was trained by them to be a killer. The show will broadcast on Monday, July 3rd, at 9:05 to 10:00 p.m on WMCA 970 AM in the New York tri-state area and streaming via PodPlus on the web at <a href="http://www.wmca.com/"><u>http://www.wmca.com/</u></a> .</p><p>~ We welcome your QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS during the broadcast ~</p><p>Call 1-888-TRUTHBH (888-878-8424)</p><p>&quot;The Blind Truth&quot; is a no-holds-barred, political call-in talk show that focuses on international and national domestic issues. The show features the husband and wife team of Barry and Diane Honig, who frequently share different political perspectives and give the radio listener a window into a typical husband and wife arguing politics and other matters of the day. The show combines incisive and sometimes esoteric information and analysis of current events, with a strong dose of humor, irony, and dry wit. Sprinkled into the talk is an eclectic set of music beds which offer transitional interludes between segments and also highlight the topic at hand. Barry is frequently controversial and as the title of the show (&quot;The Blind Truth&quot;) suggests, Barry is not afraid to say what most people are thinking, what's on his mind, and what needs to be said. The show has a decidedly Republican slant, but no politician is immune from the scrutinizing eye of &quot;The Blind Truth.&quot; Callers are encouraged to disagree, if they dare, with the views of the hosts and their guests. Irrespective of a listener's political point of view, the show is an entertaining, educational and fun listening experience. &quot;The Blind Truth&quot; airs on WMCA 970 AM on Mondays from 9:05 pm to 10:00 pm, and on Tuesday nights from 9:03 pm to 10:30 pm in the New York tri-state area and streaming on the web at <a href="http://www.wmca.com/"><u>http://www.wmca.com/</u></a> (PodPlus).

                              <strong><p></p></strong><strong><p>Certified RIAA Platinum in the U.S., 'Taking The Long Way' Crosses Two Million Mark Worldwide </p></strong><p>Four weeks after its release on May 23, Taking The Long Way, the highly-acclaimed new album from the Dixie Chicks, has achieved a platinum (for sales of 1,000,000) certification by the RIAA, bringing the group's career total up to 41 gold, platinum and multi-platinum certifications, including two RIAA Diamond Awards.</p><p>The U.S. platinum success of Taking The Long Way has been echoed in similar chart-topping sales figures around the world. Taking The Long Way debuted at #1 (and remained in the top slot for four weeks) in Canada, where it is already 2x platinum, and at #2 in Australia, where it's certified platinum. The album debuted at #8 in New Zealand, where it's been certified gold.</p><p>Released in Europe on June 12, Taking The Long Way has already crossed the two million mark in sales worldwide with the album hitting the Top 10 in Sweden (peaked at #1), Australia (#2), Germany (#5), Europe (#6) Switzerland (#6), Ireland (#7, gold), Norway (#7), Austria (#8), and the UK Top 75 (#10, gold). The album is a new entry on the charts in Finland (#17), Denmark (#37), Holland (#42), and Belgium (#61). In every market in which it's charted, with the exception of New Zealand and Ireland, Taking The Long Way has the highest-charting debut numbers of any album in the Dixie Chicks' career.</p><p>When Taking The Long Way debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 best-selling albums chart the week of its release, the Dixie Chicks became the first female group in chart history to have three albums debut at #1, breaking the record the Chicks established in 2002 when the group's last studio album, Home, debuted at #1 and made them the first female group ever to have two albums debut at #1.</p><p>With the #1 debut of Taking The Long Way, the Dixie Chicks have also become the first female group in chart history to have three studio albums occupy the #1 slot on the Top 200.</p><p>In addition to occupying the #1 spot on the Billboard 200 for two weeks in a row, Taking The Long Way has been America's #1 Top Country Album for five weeks running and was the nation's #1 Top Digital Album.</p><p>Taking The Long Way is produced by Rick Rubin (Johnny Cash, Neil Diamond, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Run-DMC) and features fourteen new songs co-written by the Dixie Chicks.</p><p>Having sold more than $100 million worth of concert tickets during their career, the Dixie Chicks are one of the most popular live acts in history. The Dixie Chicks will embark on the &quot;Accidents &amp; Accusations Tour&quot; in support of Taking The Long Way in July.
