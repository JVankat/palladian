				<small>Thursday, March 18th, 2010</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Will ecumenical “Social Justice Leaders” succeed with Obamacare?</p>
<p>More  and more Americans are realizing that the Social Justice initiatives  of modern ecumenical partnerships are  chiseling  the epitaph on the head stone  of America and the rest of the free world &#8211; one letter at a  time.</p>
<p>The  NCC and Sojourners chief Jim Wallis the same who called for a boycott of Glenn  Beck for warning people to find out what “Social Justice” means to their pastors  and bishops and leave if it is the same as Rev. <em>Jeremiah Wright&#8217;s </em>are  now willing to disregard abortion funding features of the bill as they near  the Obamacare milepost on their “Social  Justice Road” towards the perfect world.</p>
<p>Will  Moravians be counted among the majority who seeing these “Social Justice”  initiatives for what they are  put an end to the much coveted Ecumenical  Movement conceived by the NCC and engineered by the Episcopal  Church?</p>
<p>We  must face the fact that ecumenical leaders do not want any speed bumps to slow  down their efforts and certainly for the Little Moravian Church to derail the  movement would be an embarrassment of historical biblical proportion. Will this  be the corrective action that restores the church to its biblical roots? These  corrections have occured in Moravian History about every 100 years. The last  corrective stand occurred in 1907.  Do we still have what it takes to make  another historic stand?</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, March 18 /<a href="http://www.christiannewswire.com">Christian Newswire</a>/ &#8212; Believing firm restrictions on government funded abortions are no longer possible, evangelical left officials are jettisoning traditional evangelical pro-life convictions to back the U.S. Senate version of Obamacare now before the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The evangelical left initially sought to consolidate liberal evangelical support behind Obamacare by promising protections against government funded abortions. Now some evangelical left officials are claiming such protections are unnecessary.</p>
<p>A letter sent this week to Congress from some prominent liberal evangelicals claims information about abortion provisions in the Senate health care bill is misleading and urges Congress urgently to support the Senate version of Obamacare. In contrast, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes the Senate&#8217;s Obamacare, pointing out it lacks the House version&#8217;s clear restriction against government funded abortions.</p>
<p>Evangelical signers of the congressional letter include Evangelicals for Social Action President Ron Sider, Sojourners chief Jim Wallis, Florida megachurch pastor and National Association of Evangelicals Board Member Joel Hunter, New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good Chair David P. Gushee, Emergent Church guru Brian McLaren and Glen Stassen of Fuller Theological Seminary.</p>
<p>IRD President Mark Tooley commented:</p>
<p>&#8220;For the mostly new Evangelical Left and the old Religious Left, government-imposed health care is a long-time totem for which their activists have toiled across years and decades.</p>
<p>&#8220;Politically liberal evangelicals remain anxious to pass the bill, even without the Stupak-Pitts language that some of them previously supported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evangelical Left activists like Jim Wallis desperately want Obamacare despite possible abortion funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the Evangelical Left, when their espoused pro-life views conflict with messianic hopes for socialized health care, Obamacare wins.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The Institute on Religion and Democracy, founded in 1981, is an ecumenical alliance of U.S. Christians working to reform their churches’ social witness, in accord with biblical and historic Christian teachings, thereby contributing to the renewal of democratic society at home and abroad.</em></p>

					<p>President Obama’s Advisory Council on Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships has made public their votes on “non-consensus reform report issues.”  Churches accepting money from the government (actually getting some of our money back from the government) would come with strings attached.  </p>
<p>All one has to do is see how the questions were structured on the survey to see how Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships will influence those churches who participate. Make no mistake about it, Moravians will be encouraged to participate. ( Read your Moravian Magazine for Jan/Feb 2010.)  We will be expected to embrace and support the ecumenical movement’s focus on community service through support of the councils of churches.</p>
<p>As a faith based adviser, the Obama council is making it clear that Churches should focus on Distribution of Social Services absent any faith message to those they serve. </p>
<p>National council of Churches President and Moravian Peg Chemberlan votes that religious symbols should be covered or offices used that have no symbols where government funded services are given to clients.  If it is not possible to do this, and the client expresses an objection to being served in that environment where a religious message is present, another provider must be made available. </p>
<p>Now lets think about this for a moment. What would Jesus do? If the sick or needy comes to him and does not demonstrate faith in Him did he say well I can&#8217;t help you but there is another provider I can send you to that does not require you to believe. </p>
<p>Do we rally want our church to pass the test of the federal government that we do not convey our witness to a visitor?</p>

<h4>Final Vote Tallies on Non-Consensus Reform Report Issues</h4>
<p>Posted by Melissa Rogers on February 08, 2010 at 04:26 PM EST</p>
<p><em>Friends, please find below an update from the chair of the President’s Advisory Council on Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships, Melissa Rogers: </em></p>
<p>Final Vote Tallies on Non-Consensus Reform Report Issues</p>
<p>We would like to announce the final tallies of the Advisory Council votes on the non-consensus Reform Report issues.  Those tallies are listed below, with the votes favoring each option listed under the relevant answer. </p>
<p><strong>Please note that subsequent to the post on February 4, Council member Diane Baillargeon changed her votes from abstentions on both questions to the answers reflected below.</strong></p>
<p>Please contact us if you have any questions about these issues.   Thank you for your interest in the work of the Advisory Council.</p>
<p>1. Should the government allow nongovernmental providers of federally funded social services to provide those services in rooms that contain religious art, scripture, messages, or symbols?</p>
<p>a. No.  Amend existing regulations, guidance, and an executive order to permit nongovernmental organizations to offer federally funded programming only in areas devoid of religious art, scripture, messages, or symbols.</p>
<p><strong>2 votes – Fred Davie and Nancy Ratzan</strong></p>
<p>b.Amend existing regulations, guidance, and an executive order to allow federally funded programming in areas with these religious items only when there is no available space in the organizations’ offices without these items and when removing or covering such displays would be infeasible (e.g., where it would take great effort to remove or cover a religious icon mounted high on a wall or remove or cover a large statute).  If these measures are not feasible and beneficiaries object to the presence of such symbols, beneficiaries must have access to an alternative provider to which they do not object.  (See Reform Report Recommendation 10: Assure the Religious Liberty Rights of the Clients and Beneficiaries of Federally Funded Programs by Strengthening Appropriate Protections, pages 27-29.)</p>
<p><strong>7 votes – Anju Bhargava, Peg Chemberlin, Harry Knox, Eboo Patel, David Saperstein, Bill Shaw, and Sharon Watkins</strong></p>
<p>c. Yes.  Neither require nor encourage the removal of religious symbols where services subsidized by federal grant or contact funds are provided, but instead encourage all providers to be sensitive to, and to accommodate where feasible, those beneficiaries who may object to the presence of religious symbols.  If these voluntary measures do not meet the objections of the beneficiaries, those beneficiaries must have access to an alternative provider to which they do not object.  (See Reform Report Recommendation 10: Assure the Religious Liberty Rights of the Clients and Beneficiaries of Federally Funded Programs by Strengthening Appropriate Protections, pages 27-29 of the Reform Report.)</p>
<p><strong>16 votes – Diane Baillargeon, Charles Blake, Noel Castellanos, Arturo Chavez, Nathan Diament, Joel Hunter, Vashti McKenzie, Dalia Mogahed, Otis Moss, Frank Page, Anthony Picarello, Melissa Rogers, Richard Stearns, Larry Snyder, Judy Vredenburgh, and Jim Wallis</strong></p>
<p>2. Should the government require houses of worship to form separate corporations to receive direct federal social service funds?</p>
<p>a. Yes, the government should require houses of worship that wish to receive direct federal social service funds to establish separate corporations as a necessary means for achieving church-state separation and protecting religious autonomy, while also urging states to reduce any unnecessary administrative costs and burdens associated with attaining this status.</p>
<p><strong>13 votes &#8212; Diane Baillargeon, Anju Bhargava,  Charles Blake, Fred Davie, Harry Knox, Vashti McKenzie, Otis Moss, Nancy Ratzan, Melissa Rogers, David Saperstein, Bill Shaw, Jim Wallis, and Sharon Watkins </strong></p>
<p>b. No, the government should not require separate incorporation, because it is not always the best means to achieve these goals, and because it may be prohibitively costly and onerous, particularly for smaller organizations, resulting in the disruption and deterrence of effective and constitutionally permissible relationships.</p>
<p><strong>12 votes – Noel Castellanos, Arturo Chavez, Peg Chemberlin, Nathan Diament, Joel Hunter, Dalia Mogahed, Frank Page, Eboo Patel, Anthony Picarello, Larry Snyder, Richard Stearns, and Judy Vredenburgh</strong></p>
<p><em>Melissa Rogers is the chair of the President’s Advisory Council on Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships</em></p></blockquote>

					<p><strong>Moravian Church on Heath Care Overhaul</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In June the National Council of Churches released a statement entitled  <strong>Religious leaders declare health care reform ‘has become an urgent priority’</strong><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>. </strong>Moravian PEC presidents Wayne Burkett of the Southern Province and David Wickman of the Northern Province Joined 31 others including Episcopal Bishop The Most Reverend Katharine Jefferts Schori in signing the declaration. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The NCC states: “<em>Signers of the declaration, which was drafted with the assistance of the National Council of Churches <a href="http://www.health-ministries.org/" target="_blank">Health Task Force</a>, will seek a meeting with President Obama next month to press the point and assure him of their support for reform</em>.  </p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A MATTER OF HEALTH&#8230;A MATTER OF WHOLENESS</p>
<p>Today health care reform has become an urgent priority, with many Americans fearful about the health care they now hold and more than 45 million lacking coverage altogether. Rising unemployment, underemployment and a decline in employment benefits have deprived many more of health care. The health of our neighbors and the wholeness of the nation now require that all segments of our society join in finding a solution to this national challenge.<strong>&#8220;&#8230;Learn to do good, seek justice; rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow.&#8221; Isaiah 1:17</strong><strong>&#8220;&#8230;Love your neighbor as you love yourself.&#8221; Matthew 22:39</strong><strong>&#8220;&#8230;Ye who believe! Stand up firmly for Allah, witness to justice&#8230;be just, that is next to piety.&#8221; Qur&#8217;an 5:8</strong></p>
<p>Our diverse communities of faith -Jewish, Christian and Muslim- are each shaped and guided by our respective sacred texts which compel us to speak out on behalf of the most vulnerable members of our society. Today that means making comprehensive and compassionate health care reform an urgent priority so that all of our neighbors, especially the people living in poverty, children, and the aged, can be assured of the fullness of life that is central to the holy vision of a beloved and peaceable community.</p>
<p>No longer can we afford to squander the hopes and dreams of the American people through a much-too-costly system that contributes to economic despair. Families and individuals must be able to rely on affordable care in times of illness or accident and preventative care to safeguard health and well-being. Those who are ill need the assurance that coverage will not be canceled by illness or employment circumstance. They should also be afforded the dignity of selecting their own caregivers.</p>
<p>Today we pray, each in our own custom, for discernment, boldness, clarity and leadership in each segment of our society so that we may find the resolve to achieve health reform worthy of this land. As we together pursue this vision our direction is certain-it is toward the common good. The prospect of high-quality, affordable health care for everyone is a measure of our wholeness as a nation.</p>
<p>We pray that our best minds and kindest hearts might be joined in this effort so that all men, women and children will have the health care they need to live the lives for which they were created. We stand ready to give our support and energies to its achievement.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> I have to wonder if these spiritual leaders have been given details of the health care plan that have not yet come to light. For many including myself and hopefully our national lawmakers, we are looking for specifics assurances that this plan will not move us to a 3<sup>rd</sup> world health system as plans of this kind have done without exception. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last year I went to my family doctor with some chest pains. He immediately got me an appointment with a Cardiologist. In less than an hour I was in his office. I was not having pain at that time but explained exactly what the symptoms were. He said “usually we would schedule you for a stress test to determine the next step of treatment.  But your story is too good. I am convinced you need to be in the hospital ASAP.  The next day I was having a stint placed in a coronary artery that was 90% blocked. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The system worked and by law it has to work for everyone. Adding more layers of authority and pre approvals may give more people government jobs placing them on the government health system while putting the rest of us in a unproven socialized experiment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My Cardiologist has since retired and has this to say about the proposed health care plan. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>I am a retired cardiologist and I have practiced for many years in government, academic and private venues. The most inefficient, impersonal and lowest quality care I observed was in government institutions.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>People vote with their feet and come here from all over the world for care, especially Canadians dissatisfied with long waiting lines or unavailability of needed procedures under their government-run system.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Polls have shown most Americans are reasonably satisfied with their own care. By law, no one is denied care, and according to Karl Rove (&#8221;Obama&#8217;s Great Health Scare,&#8221; Wall Street Journal, July 29), only about 2 percent of American citizens actually want and need health insurance but cannot afford it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>From what I have learned about the 1,000-plus page health-care bill, it will be a bureaucratic nightmare and a giant step toward total government control of medicine. It is obvious that we will ultimately lose our current private-insurance plans.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>According to a 2005 Heritage Foundation report, Medicare has an estimated $2.7 trillion in unfunded mandates over the next 10 years. Imagine the astronomical cost to the taxpayers of extending such a program to everyone.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>I shudder to think that my family and I, and all Americans, may lose our freedom to choose our own doctors and hospitals and may be forced to endure substandard health care under the direction of blundering politicians and bureaucrats, while at the same time we are impoverished by the crushing taxes that will be required to pay for it”</em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;">3 Nov 2008</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;">Some one recently sent me a link to a sermon by pastor Denny Kenaston and made available at CharityMinistries.org.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;">The topic of pastor Kenaston’s message was “The radical example of Moravian Missions”. After listening to the message, heard <a href="http://moravians.org/The%20Radical%20Example%20of%20Moravian%20Mission.ra">here</a>, I became interested in the phrase that was shouted from the deck of the departing ship caring early missionaries off to far ports. Many of these missionaries would not return and they and their families knew this. The passionate rally cry lifted by by those early missionaries was “<strong><em>May the Lamb that was slain receive the reward of his sufferings”</em></strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;">This phrase has found use by many whose ministry share the same passionate concern of early Moravians for lost souls.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;">An internet search will return many hits on this phrase but it may be difficult to find on any official Moravian web site. Please let me know if you find mention of it there. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> I found the following You tube video on the subject below.  Below that is an article by David Smithers for consideration in light of the claim by promoters of the Ecumenical Movement that drives them towards  Full Communion with other churches like the Lutheran and now the Episcopal Church that we have always been an ecumenical Church seeking full communion.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">Can the desire of Count Zinzendor for restoration of the Apostolic Community be so broadly apllied. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;">by David Smithers</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><br />
Throughout the history of the Church, it has always been the most ardent lovers of Jesus who have felt the greatest need for more of His presence. Surely it is with this class of saints that Count Zinzendorf belongs. For Zinzendorf, loving fellowship with Christ was the essential manifestation of the Christian life. Throughout the Count&#8217;s life, &#8220;His blessed presence&#8221; was his all consuming theme. He had chosen from an early age as his life-motto the now famous confession; <em>&#8220;I have one passion;it is Jesus, Jesus only.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">A Man of Prayer</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Flowing out of Zinzendorf&#8217;s passionate love for Christ came a life disciplined in prayer. &#8220;Count Zinzendorf had early learned the secret of prevailing prayer. So active had he been in establishing circles for prayer that on leaving the college at Halle, at 16 years of age , he handed the famous professor Franke a list of seven praying societies.&#8221; Also preceding the great Moravian revival of 1727, it was Count Zinzendorf who was used to encourage prayer for a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit. John Greenfield describes for us the constant prayer that followed the revival of 1727. &#8220;Was there ever in the whole of church history such an astonishing prayer meeting as that which beginning in 1727, went on one hundred years? It was known as the &#8216;Hourly Intercession.&#8217; And it meant that by relays of brothers and sisters, prayer without ceasing was made to God for all the work and wants of His church.&#8217; The best antidote for a powerless Church is the influence of a praying man. The influence of Count Zinzendorf&#8217;s prayer-life did not stop with one small community. It ultimately went on to influence the whole world. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;">Souls for the Lamb </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">As Zinzendorf&#8217;s passion for Jesus grew, so did his passion for the lost. He became determined to evangelize the world with a handful of saints, equipped only with a burning love for Jesus and the power of prayer. The Moravian Brotherhood readily received and perpetuated the passion of their leader. A seal was designed to express their newfound missionary zeal. The seal was composed of a lamb on a crimson ground, with the cross of resurrection and a banner of triumph with the motto; &#8220;Our Lamb has conquered, let us follow Him.&#8221; The Moravians recognized themselves in debt to the world as the trustees of the gospel. They were taught to embrace a lifestyle of self-denial, sacrifice and prompt obedience. They followed the call of the Lamb to go anywhere and with an emphasis upon the worst and hardest places as having the first claim. No soldiers of the cross have ever been bolder as pioneers, more patient or persistent in difficulties, more heroic in suffering, or more entirely devoted to Christ and the souls of men than the Moravian Brother-hood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Moravians beautifully explain their motivation for missions in the following 1791 evangelical report. &#8220;The simple motive of the brethren for sending missionaries to distant nations was and is an ardent desire to promote the salvation of their fellow men, by making known to them the gospel of our Savior Jesus Christ. It grieved them to hear of so many thousands and millions of the human race sitting in darkness and groaning beneath the yoke of sin and the tyranny of Satan; and remembering the glorious promises given in the Word of God, that the heathen also should be the reward of the sufferings and death of Jesus; and considering His commandment to His followers, to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, they were filled with confident hopes that if they went forth in obedience unto, and believing in His word, their labor would not be in vain in the Lord. They were not dismayed in reflecting on the smallness of their means and abilities, and that they hardly knew their way to the heathen whose salvation they so ardently longed for, nor by the prospect of enduring hardships of every kind and even perhaps the loss of their lives in the attempt. Yet their love to their Savior and their fellow sinners for whom He shed His blood, far outweighed all these considerations. They went forth in the strength of their God and He has wrought wonders in their behalf.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Moravians had learned that the secret of loving the souls of men was found in loving the Savior of men. On October 8,1732, a Dutch ship left the Copenhagen harbor bound for the Danish West Indies. On board were the two first Moravian missionaries; John Leonard Dober, a potter, and David Nitschman, a carpenter. Both were skilled speakers and ready to sell themselves into slavery to reach the slaves of the West Indies. As the ship slipped away, they lifted up a cry that would one day become the rallying call for all Moravian missionaries, &#8220;May the Lamb that was slain receive the reward of His suffering.&#8221; The Moravian&#8217;s passion for souls was surpassed only by their passion for the Lamb of God, Jesus Christ. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;">They Had All Things In Common </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Another vision of Count Zinzendorf&#8217;s was that of the restoration of Apostolic community. He labored to establish a community of saints that loved and supported one another through prayer, encouragement and accountability. To a great extent Zinzendorf&#8217;s vision became a reality in the small village of Herrnhut. A deep sense of community was maintained through small groups based on common needs and interests, original and unifying hymns and continual prayer meetings. In 1738 John Wesley visited &#8220;this happy place&#8221; and was so impressed that he commented in his journal &#8220;I would gladly have spent my life here . . . Oh, when shall this Christianity cover the earth as water covers the sea?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial;">He Had No Other Happiness But To Be Near Him</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">By no means was Count Zinzendorf&#8217;s life flawless, but one cannot help but be moved by his consuming passion and pre-occupation with the person of Jesus Christ. A glimpse of his burning love for Jesus can be caught in the following letter. &#8220;Our method of proclaiming salvation is this: to point out to every heart the loving Lamb, who died for us, and although He was the Son of God, offered Himself for our sins &#8230; by the preaching of His blood, and of His love unto death, even the death of the cross, never, either in discourse or in argument, to digress even for a quarter of an hour from the loving Lamb: to name no virtue except in Him, and from Him and on His account,-to preach no commandment except faith in Him; no other justification but that He atoned for us; no other sanctification but the privilege to sin no more; no other happiness but to be near Him, to think of Him and do His pleasure; no other self denial but to be deprived of Him and His blessings; no other calamity but to displease Him; no other life but in Him.&#8217; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The source of Count Zinzendorf&#8217;s success was bound up in his total allegiance and love for JESUS CHRIST! Likewise the source of the modern Church&#8217;s failure lies in her half-hearted devotion and open disregard for the Lover of their souls. As the Bride of Christ, we are in need of some old-fashioned, gut wrenching, REAL repentance. Today, Jesus, the heartbroken Bridegroom, still cries out to us; &#8220;Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love. Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the first works, . . . (Rev. 2:4-5) </span></p>

					<p>As details and language for the Moravian Episcopal Church communion Agreement seems complete waiting “copy editing” for the past 5 months. The <strong><em>Debate/Dialogue*</em></strong> continues to clarify the positions and divisions that diminishes the Episcopal Church USA.</p>
<p><strong>*“A debate is a conflict which clarifies a position. A dialogue is a conversation which compromises a position”</strong> (John Ashbrook, The New Neutralism II, 1992, p. 7).</p>
<p>The Communiqué’ that follows is a response by GAFCON composed of those Anglicans/Episcopals who have either pulled away or are planning to pull away from the Episcopal Church USA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="itemText"> </p>
<p class="itemText">GAFCON Communiqué on establishment of Primates Council and Fellowship</p>
<p>The first meeting of the GAFCON Primates Council took place in London from Wednesday 20th to Friday 22nd August 2008. A Communiqué is published here, together with a letter sent by US bishops for council&#8217;s consideration.</p>
<p>Communiqué</p>
<p>Setting up the Council and the Fellowship</p>
<p>The first meeting of the GAFCON Primates&#8217; Council has taken place in London on Wednesday 20th to Friday 22nd August. The twofold task of the Council is &#8216;to authenticate and recognise confessing Anglican jurisdictions, clergy and congregations and to encourage all Anglicans to promote the gospel and defend the faith.&#8217; The Primates have therefore laid the basis for the future work of both the Council and the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (FCA). The GAFCON movement continues its advance.</p>
<p>The Council will consist of Primates assisted by an Advisory Board which will work with them on fulfilling the aims of the movement. In addition, a Secretariat has been created. We are very grateful to God for his guidance and blessing on the Jerusalem Conference. We believe that the Jerusalem Declaration provides for a viable way of helping to deal with the crisis in the Anglican Communion brought about through the disobedience to Scripture by some in North America and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The present reality</p>
<p>We maintain that three new facts of the Anglican Communion must be faced. We are past the time when they can be reversed.</p>
<p>First, some Anglicans have sanctified sinful practices and will continue to do so whatever others may think. Second, churches and even dioceses affected by this disobedience have rightly withdrawn fellowship while wishing to remain authentic Anglicans. So-called &#8216;border-crossing&#8217; is another way of describing the provision of recognition and care for those who have been faithful to the teachings of Holy Scripture. Third, there is widespread impaired and broken sacramental communion amongst Anglicans with far-reaching global implications. The hope that we may somehow return to the state of affairs before 2003 is an illusion.</p>
<p>Any sound strategy must accommodate itself to these facts.</p>
<p>Developing the GAFCON movement</p>
<p>GAFCON remains a gospel movement. It is far from saying that its membership are the only true Anglicans or the only gospel people in the Anglican Communion. We thank God that this is not the case. But the movement recognises the acute spiritual dangers of a compromised theology and aims to be a resource and inspiration for those who wish to defend and promote the biblical gospel.</p>
<p>The Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans will function as a means of sharing in this great task. We invite individuals, churches, dioceses, provinces and parachurch organisations who assent to the Jerusalem Declaration to signify their desire to become members of the Fellowship via the GAFCON web-site or written communication with the Secretariat. The Fellowship will develop networks, commissions and publications intended to defend and promote the biblical gospel in ways which support one another.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Council and its Advisory Board will seek to deal with the problems of those who have confessed the biblical faith in the face of hostility and found the need on grounds of conscience and in matters of great significance to break the normal bonds of fellowship in the name of the gospel. For the sake of the Anglican Communion this is an effort to bring order out of the chaos of the present time and to make sure as far as possible that some of the most faithful Anglican Christians are not lost to the Communion. It is expected that priority will be given to the possible formation of a province in North America for the Common Cause Partnership.</p>
<p>Lambeth 2008</p>
<p>Noting the reference to building bridges with GAFCON in the Archbishop of Canterbury&#8217;s concluding Presidential Address at Lambeth, and that the Lambeth Conference itself made no decisions about the future of the Communion, we are grateful that there is an acknowledgement that Lambeth 1.10 of 1998 remains an authentic expression of the mind of the Communion. We also note the renewed call for moratoria on the consecration of bishops who are homosexually partnered and the blessing of same-sex unions as well so-called &#8216;border-crossing&#8217;. Likewise there is mention of the creation of a &#8216;Pastoral Forum&#8217; to look after disaffected parishes or dioceses and continued work on an Anglican Covenant.</p>
<p>We hope in due course to offer a longer response to Lambeth. Meanwhile we are saddened that the Conference did not offer a more effective way forward than what is proposed. Our immediate difficulty is that the voice of Lambeth 2008 is seriously weakened because it merely repeated what has been said by the Primates&#8217; Meeting (in Gramada early 2003, Lambeth October 2003, Dromantine, February 2005 and Dar es Salaam, February 2007) and which has proved to change nothing. Indeed the Windsor Continuation Group itself made the same point, &#8216;The three moratoria have been requested several times: Windsor (2004); Dromantine (2005); Dar es Salaam (2007) and the requests have been less than wholeheartedly embraced on all sides&#8230; The failure to respond presents us with a situation where if the three moratoria are not observed the Communion is likely to fracture.&#8217;</p>
<p>But the Communion fractured in 2003, when our fellowship was &#8216;torn at its deepest level.&#8217; It seems that the facts which we have identified as the new reality have not yet been recognised as such, and we are therefore continually offered the same strategies which mean further delay and unlikely results. Indeed, delay itself seems to be a strategy employed by some in order to resolve the issue through weariness. The Anglican Covenant will take a long time to be widely accepted and may have no particular force when it does. The idea of &#8216;moratoria&#8217; has never dealt with the underlying problem as is shown by the equivalence of cross-border care and protection with the sexual sins which have caused the problems.</p>
<p>In any case, some North American Bishops appear to have indicated already that they will not keep to them. It appears that people living in a homosexual unions continue to be ordained in some dioceses in contravention to Lambeth 1.10. In principle, this is no different from consecrating a bishop who adopts the same pattern of life, or indeed, of blessing same-sex unions. The idea of the Pastoral Forum has only now emerged but has never been discussed with those actually affected by the innovations which have created the problems with which we are trying to deal (see appended letter). If the Panel of Reference did not work, it is unclear how the Pastoral Forum will succeed.</p>
<p>Given that some esteemed colleagues from the Global South have strongly commended the Windsor Process to us, we are reluctant to say that it cannot work. But there is nothing new here such as to make us hesitate from the course we are taking, given the urgency of the situations with which we are dealing and the realities already on the ground. As they themselves remark, &#8216;the Anglican Communion as a communion of ordered churches is at the probable brink of collapse&#8217;. We warmly appreciate the good words which they have written about GAFCON and look forward to co-operation with them in the future as we ourselves try to avoid that collapse and renew the Communion.</p>

<hr />Letter from US bishops to GAFCON</p>
<p>Reflections from North American bishops about the Windsor Continuation Group. The following is the text of a letter referred to in the GAFCON Primates Council communiqué.</p>
<p>Tuesday, August 19th, 2008</p>
<p>The Most Rev&#8217;d Peter J. Akinola<br />
Primate of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion)<br />
Chairman of the GAFCON Primates Council</p>
<p>Your Grace:</p>
<p>These reflections are presented to you for the consideration of the Primates Council.</p>
<p>We are bishops who serve in North America, under the canonical authority of the Primates of the Anglican Church of Kenya, the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), the Anglican Church of Rwanda, the Province of the Southern Cone and the Anglican Church of Uganda. We represent approximately 300 congregations, with more than 450 clergy and an Average Sunday Attendance of 50,000.</p>
<p>We are profoundly grateful for the privilege of serving as Bishops during this critical time in the life of the Anglican Communion. We have been blessed by the encouragement that we have each received from our Primates and the House of Bishops of our respective Provinces. We have experienced God&#8217;s favor through their prayers and fellowship.</p>
<p>As requested we have carefully studied the Reflections of the Windsor Continuation Group &#8211; in particular the section that refers to our ministry within the North America. We offer these comments:</p>
<p>1. While we appreciate the sincerity and work of those who took part in the Windsor Continuation Group, we were grieved to note that the carefully balanced recommendations proposed by the Primates at their meetings in Dromantine and Dar es Salaam have been abandoned in favor of these new proposals without acknowledgement that the primary reason for their failure was their unilateral rejection by The Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>2. We note that the Pastoral Forum proposal has been developed without any consultation with those most directly affected in North America. This had led to a number of serious misunderstandings with regard to the situation at the local level and the relationship between the bishops, clergy and congregations and their sponsoring provinces.</p>
<p>3. We would also observe that the various analogies offered, for example, that we are disaffected children being reunited with our parents or that we are being placed in a holding bay before being restored to our &#8220;proper province&#8221; are both demeaning and unacceptable.</p>
<p>4. As was also the case with the statements from Dromantine and Dar es Salaam we reject the moral equivalence that is now explicitly asserted between those who continue to support the blessing of same sex unions and the ordination of persons involved in same gender unions in deliberate violation of the teaching of the Communion and those who are offering pastoral oversight for those alienated by these actions.</p>
<p>5. We have consistently observed that the current leadership of The Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada have embraced a theological and doctrinal stance that is diametrically opposed to the teaching of the Communion and more specifically that of our host provinces and our individual bishops, clergy and congregations. Consequently we can envision no way in which we could be part of Pastoral Forum in which either Church exercises any leadership role.</p>
<p>6. While we welcomed the comments of the Windsor Continuation Group that &#8220;ways of halting litigation must be explored,&#8221; those of us who are the subject of pernicious litigation initiated by The Episcopal Church find these rather tentative comments fall far short of what is needed for us to even consider any serious engagement with the proposed structures. Until the litigation is halted and a settlement achieved there is no possibility that we can enter into any formal agreements with any representatives of The Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>We are grateful for the opportunity to respond to your request and are more than ready to elaborate on these comments. We have discussed them with the leadership of the Common Cause Partnership and assure you that they come with their unanimous support.</p>
<p>In Christ&#8217;s service:</p>
<p>The Rt. Rev&#8217;d Bill Atwood, Anglican Church of Kenya</p>
<p>The Rt. Rev&#8217;d John Guernsey, Anglican Church of Uganda</p>
<p>The Rt. Rev&#8217;d Don Harvey, Anglican Province of the Southern Cone</p>
<p>The Rt. Rev&#8217;d Martyn Minns, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion)</p>
<p>The Rt. Rev&#8217;d Chuck Murphy, Anglican Church of Rwanda</p></blockquote>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Can the Church survive as the tension spring continues to be tightened? Orthodox traditionalists are cautious and resistant to the new religion of <em><strong>ecumenical unity</strong></em> that debases their witness &#8211; bringing the soul saving message to non-believers.  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The Moravian Church has been thrust onto the world stage by the election of  Rev. Peg <span style="color: #000000;">Chemberlin described as ordained in the Moravian Church.  Rev. Peggy Chemberlin became President-Elect of the National Council of Churches last </span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN;">January and will be president in January 2010</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">. . Her leadership has focused on social justice and interfaith dialogues.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Chemberlin, addressing an Episcopalian audience at a Minnesota Council of Churches meeting in November 2007 says: “We are living in a village that is wounded, fragmented</span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-size: 7.5pt;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">and isolated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We have a different witness to bring of relatedness through the blood of the 2nd person of the trinity - relatedness to the whole creation through the 1st person of the trinity.”</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The opportunities here are first that the Moravian Church will have influence over the direction of the NCC, or second, the NCC will gain more credibility in the eyes of Moravian Leadership in the Councils ecumenical efforts to circle the wagons of all <em><strong>faith communities</strong></em> around social justice and global resource conservation.  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Moravians may feel an obligation to become cheerleaders to the council of churches and their agendas. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The NCC defines its roll as an agent of social change.. It’s self-proclaimed <em><strong>witness of social justice</strong></em> is heralded as a replacement for a witness of salvation, which they hope, will bring unity into those churches facing theological division of purpose. <em><strong>The NCC says that” working for social justice in the world is a cause and witness that all faith groups can share regardless who they worship as God and therefore be the basis of ecumenical unity”. </strong></em>This is not the basis of scriptural unity that the NCC sold the ecumenical movement to its member churches on. But what’s in a little language change among friends? </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Alarm is expressed from within the council itself. Delegates at the latest NCC General Assembly openly questioned the ecumenical body&#8217;s focus on political activism and the ways in which that activism has been expressed. African Methodist Episcopal Bishop Earl McCloud asserted that leaders of NCC member communions &#8220;ought to be consulted before positions are taken [by the NCC] on certain issues.&#8221; McCloud was challenging the NCC staff&#8217;s frequent practice of unilaterally taking political positions. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;" lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The delegates, who were meeting November 8-10 near Baltimore, Maryland, were aware that the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese had quit the NCC earlier this year &#8211; in part because of the council&#8217;s liberal political stances. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;" lang="EN">Delegate after delegate passionately denounced a newly proposed NCC vision statement. They complained that the statement focused on what they said was the &#8220;secondary&#8221; concern of &#8220;peace and justice,&#8221; instead of the primary concern of building unity in Christ. &#8220;We should be speaking with the vision of the church and not a political agenda!&#8221; declared Greek Orthodox delegate Eve Tibbs. A Disciples of Christ delegate worried that the vision statement failed to distinguish the NCC &#8220;from a generic liberal social action group.&#8221; He asserted that &#8220;it&#8217;s arrogant&#8221; for the NCC churches &#8220;to tell the nation what to do&#8221; before they first &#8220;seek peace and justice among ourselves.&#8221; A United Church of Christ delegate fretted that a politicized NCC vision would make it harder to bring additional churches into the council.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Some see the ecumenical effort as good not only for social well-being but also the health of the institution of the Church that is losing members among its more liberal revisionist congregations who are debating purpose. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> Certianly the decision for &#8211; or against full communion with the Episcopal Church will be another center stage performance that will draw world attention. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">What might the Full Communion resolution agreement with the Episcopal Church Look Like?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">The actual agreement will not be available until June says PEC President Wayne Burkett who assures the Olivet Moravian Church’s Board that the agreement does little more than to allow Moravians to participate in the Eucharist.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Finding information about the process has been impossible. So I will turn to the only resolution on Full Communion involving the Moravian Church to date that, I am aware of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In 1998 both Northern and Southern Synod of the Moravian Church voted on a resolution that established Full Communion between the Moravian Church in America and the Lutheran Church in America. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I will grant you that we cannot draw conclusive opinions on the Episcopal agreement from this 1998 Resolution but it might be safe to conclude that this agreement had to be carefully considered, as the resolution itself requires!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">As you read carefully through this document it might answer some questions about the ongoing process with the Episcopal Dialogue.</span></p>
