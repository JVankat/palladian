<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Do I really make a difference by playing FreeRice?</h3>

<p>The rice you donate makes a huge difference to the person who
receives it. </p>
<p>According to the United Nations, <a href="http://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats" title="hunger stats">a child dies every 6 seconds from hunger related causes</a>.</p>

<p>Though 10 grains of rice may seem like a small amount, it is important
to remember that while you are playing, so are thousands of other
people at the same time. It is everyone together that makes the
difference. Thanks to you, FreeRice has generated enough rice to feed
millions of people since it started in October 2007.</p>

<h4>Find out <a href="http://www.wfp.org/hunger" title="hunger facts">more Hunger Facts</a>.</h4>

<h3> How does playing the vocabulary game at FreeRice help me?</h3>

<p>Learning new vocabulary has tremendous benefits. It can help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formulate your ideas better</li>
<li>Write better papers, emails and business letters</li>
<li>Speak more precisely and persuasively</li>
<li>Comprehend more of what you read</li>
<li>Read faster because you comprehend better</li>
<li>Get better grades in high school, college and graduate school</li>
<li>Score higher on tests like the SAT, GRE, LSAT and GMAT</li>
<li>Perform better at job interviews and conferences</li>
<li>Sell yourself, your services, and your products better</li>
<li>Be more effective and successful at your job</li>
</ul>

<p>After you have done FreeRice for a while, you may notice an odd
phenomenon. Words that you have never consciously used before will
begin to pop into your head while you are speaking or writing. You will
<em>feel</em> yourself using and knowing more words.</p> 

<h3>How do I do other subjects besides vocabulary at FreeRice?</h3>

<p>Click on the <a href="http://www.freerice.com/subjects.php">Subjects</a>
link near the top right of the page to see a list of all subjects
available at FreeRice. There is math, science, geography, art history,
other languages and more. FreeRice is working to add more subjects and
more material within each subject. Our goal is to provide knowledge
that is useful and interesting for you.</p>

<h3>Why do I see some questions repeated?</h3>

<p>Whenever you get a question wrong, FreeRice will repeat it a few turns later to give you a second chance at it. </p>

<h3>Who pays for the donated rice?</h3>

<p>The rice is paid for by the <a href="http://www.wfp.org/how-to-help/companies/donors" title="freerice sponsors">sponsors</a> whose names you see on the
bottom of your screen when you enter a correct answer. These sponsors
support both learning (free education for everyone) and reducing hunger
(free rice for the hungry). We thank these sponsors for their generous
participation at FreeRice. For information about how you or your
company can sponsor FreeRice, please email <a href="mailto:freerice.rep@wfp.org">freerice.rep@wfp.org</a>.</p>

<h3>How do I start playing FreeRice?</h3>

<p>In the middle of the FreeRice Home page you will see something like:</p>

<blockquote style="margin-left: 140px;">
<p style="margin-bottom: 6px;"><strong>small</strong> means:</p>

<p>little<br>
old<br>
big<br>
yellow<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To play the game, click on one of the four definitions (.little,.
.old,. .big,. or .yellow.) that you think is correct. If you get it
right, FreeRice donates 10 grains of rice to help end hunger. In the
example above, you would want to click on .little,. which means
.small.. You will then get a chance to do another word the same way.
You can play as long as you like and donate as much rice as you like.
When you are finished, you do not have to do anything.your donation is
already counted.</p> 

<h3>How does the FreeRice program work?</h3>

<p>FreeRice has a custom database containing knowledge questions at
varying levels of difficulty. There are levels appropriate for
beginners and levels that will challenge the most scholarly professors.
In between are levels suitable for students of all ages, business
people, homemakers, doctors, truck drivers, retired people. everyone!</p> 

<p>FreeRice automatically adjusts to your level. It starts by giving
you questions of increasing difficulty and then, based on how you do,
assigns you an approximate starting level. You then determine a more
exact level for yourself as you play. When you get a question wrong,
you go to an easier level. When you get three questions in a row right,
you go to a harder level. This one-to-three ratio is best for keeping
you at the .outer fringe. of your skills, where learning can take place.</p>


<h3>How is the difficulty level determined?</h3>

<p>The program keeps track of how many people get each question right
or wrong, and then adjusts each question.s difficulty level
accordingly. So the questions at the easiest levels are the ones that
people most often get right. The questions at the hardest levels are
the ones that people most often get wrong. As more and more people have
played the game, these levels have become increasingly more accurate.</p>

<h3>What is the Options page?</h3>

<p>On the <a href="http://www.freerice.com/options.php">Options</a>
page you can set FreeRice to remember how much total rice you have
donated for the next time you play. Instructions are given at the
bottom of that page.</p>

<h3>What happens if my computer suddenly loses power while I am in the middle of playing? Does my donation still count?</h3>

<p>Yes, once your screen says that you have donated a certain amount of
rice, that means our servers have registered it. For example, suppose
your screen says that you have donated 120 grains of rice. If your
computer then suddenly loses power, or you close your browser, or you
click to go somewhere else, your donation has already been counted.</p>

<h3>How do I hear a word pronounced?</h3>

<p>To hear one of the vocabulary words pronounced out loud, click on
the speaker symbol to the right of the word. Speech over the Internet
is not an exact science and there are a number of things you can check
if you do not hear the word pronounced. Check that your computer has
speakers, that the volume is turned up and not on mute, and that you
have Flash installed (most computers do). Also, some recently added
words may not have their pronunciations done yet. The pronunciations
are very kindly provided by <a href="http://www.espindle.org/" style="text-decoration: none;">eSpindle.org</a>, a non-profit organization that tutors vocabulary and spelling online. </p>

<h3>Where does FreeRice get the word definitions from?</h3>
 
<p>The word definitions for English vocabulary come from a wide variety
of sources including dictionaries, thesauruses and books of synonyms.
Each definition is double-checked and edited for accuracy. There are 60
levels of vocabulary with over 12,000 words in all, but it is rare for
people to get above level 50.</p>

<h3>How do you track the answers and rice donated for each person?</h3>

<p>When you click on your choice for the answer, this information is
sent to one of our servers via a regular HTML form. This form is then
processed by the server using the PHP programming language, which then
figures out if you got the answer correct and, if so, adds to both your
personal rice total and the overall rice total. It then sends back an
HTML page with new words and your new total as part of the next form.</p>

<h3>If FreeRice has the rice to give, why not give it all away right now?</h3>

<p>FreeRice is not sitting on a pile of rice.you are earning it 10
grains at a time. Here is how it works. When you play the game, sponsor
banners appear on the bottom of your screen. The money generated by
these banners is then used to buy the rice. So by playing, you generate
the money that pays for the rice donated to hungry people.</p>

<h3>Couldn't I just write a computer program to play all day and give a lot of rice that way?</h3>

<p>There are two problems with this. First, it overloads our servers so
that real people can't play and learn. Second, without real people
playing and the resulting company sponsorship, no money would be
generated and we could not give any rice at all.</p>

<h3>Does FreeRice make any money from doing this?</h3>

<p>FreeRice does not make any money from this. FreeRice is a website
committed to the cause of ending hunger around the world. It is run
entirely for free and at no profit. All money (100%) raised by the site
goes to the UN World Food Programme to help feed the hungry. Sponsors
make all payments to the UN World Food Programme directly. </p>

<h3>What is the history of FreeRice?</h3>

<p>FreeRice was founded in October 2007 by <a href="http://www.wfp.org/content/freerice-web-phenomenon-games-new-school-term">John Breen</a>. In March 2009
Mr. Breen donated the site to the UN World Food Programme. In making the
donation, Mr. Breen expressed his hopes that FreeRice will be able to
grow over the coming years, helping to feed and educate as many people
as possible throughout the world.</p>

<h3>Can you tell me more about the UN World Food Programme (WFP)?</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.wfp.org/first-time-here" title="Fighting World Hunger">UN World Food Programme<a/> (WFP) distributes all of the rice that you
donate to <a href="http://www.wfp.org/our-work" title="fighting world hunger">help fight hunger</a>. It is the United Nations frontline agency in the fight against global hunger and the world's largest humanitarian organization, working closely with many other organizations in over 75 countries.</p>
<p>In addition to providing food, WFP helps hungry people to become
self-reliant so that they escape hunger for good. Wherever possible,
they <a href="http://www.wfp.org/procurement" title="buy food locally to support local farmers and the local community.
Please visit the WFP website to learn more at <a href="http://www.wfp.org/" title="fighting world hunger">www.wfp.org</a>.</p> 

<h3>In what countries does the UN World Food Programme distribute the rice?</h3>

<p>The UN World Food Programme <a href="http://www.wfp.org/countries" title="hunger hot spots"> works around the globe</a> and FreeRice donations are made with no restrictions. This freedom of use allows them to apply the donations to countries that need it most, often those that don't make the headlines in the news, yet where <a href="http://www.wfp.org/hunger/faqs" title="what is chronic hunger">chronic hunger</a> continues unchecked.</p>
<p>Often World Food Programme is able to purchase the rice in the very countries where the beneficiaries are located, cutting down on the transport time to reach the hungry and helping to stimulate local economies at the same time.</p> 

<p>Here are some examples of where FreeRice rice has been distributed:</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="http://www.wfp.org/countries/bangladesh" title="hunger in Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, to feed 27,000 refugees from Myanmar for two weeks. <a href="http://www.wfp.org/videos/freerice-reaches-bangladesh">Watch FreeRice being distributed in Bangladesh.</a></li>
<li>In <a href="http://www.wfp.org/countries/cambodia" title="hunger in cambodia">Cambodia</a>, to provide take-home rations of four kilograms of rice for two months to 13,500 pregnant and nursing women.</li> 
<li>In <a href="http://www.wfp.org/countries/uganda" title="hunegr in uganda">Uganda</a>, to feed 66,000 school children for a week.</li>
<li>In <a href="http://www.wfp.org/countries/nepal" title="hunger in nepal">Nepal</a>, to feed over 108,000 Bhutanese refugees for three days.</li>
<li>In <a href="http://www.wfp.org/countries/bhutan" title="huger in bhutan">Bhutan</a>, to feed 41,000 children for 8 days.</li>
<li>In <a href="http://www.wfp.org/countries/myanmar" title="hunger in myanmar">Myanmar</a>, to feed 750,000 cyclone affected people for 3 days.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How much rice does it take to feed a person for a day? How many grains of rice in a gram?</h3>

<p>The composition of UN World Food Programme <a href="http://www.wfp.org/nutrition/WFP-foodbasket">food basket</a> varies
from country to country and region to region, depending upon the eating
habits of the people WFP feeds. </p>

<p>In countries where rice is a staple part of the diet, World Food Programme provides, on average about 400 grams of rice per
person, per day (for families, including children and adults). That is intended for two meals that include other ingredients to ensure a minimum of 2,100 kilocalories per day. </p>

<p>There are about 48 grains of rice in a gram.</p> 

<h3>How does the <a href="http://www.wfp.org/global-food-crisis-in-depth" title="food crisis impact on price of rice">food prices crisis affect FreeRice</a>?</h3>

<p>The cost of rice per metric ton has more than doubled since the website's inception. Given that FreeRice players raise grains of rice,not dollars, this increase does not change the overall number of people fed. </p>

<p>However, FreeRice donates the cash equivalent of the grains raised through sponsorships and donations, so rising rice prices means that FreeRice has to raise significantly more money to pay for the grains generated by every correct click.</p>

<h3>Why has the number of grains donated for each correct answer changed from 10 grains to 20 and then back to 10?</h3>

<p>When FreeRice started in October 2007, we gave 10 grains of rice for each correct answer. We were then fortunate enough to be able to increase this to 20 grains for 2008. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, we then had to decrease this to 10 grains again in January 2009 as a result of the global economic crisis and its effect on internet advertising. When the economic climate improves, we hope to be able to increase it once again.</p>

<h3>Can you tell me more about the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University?</h3>

<h3>What is being done to end world hunger?</h3>

<p>There is great progress being made to end world hunger. Many
organizations across the globe are involved in this struggle. Each day,
hundreds of thousands of ordinary men and women work for these
organizations. Through their efforts, millions of impoverished people
have food to eat, learn skills and find hope for the future.
<a href="http://www.wfp.org/our-work">Find out more about how WFP is fighting to end world hunger.<a/></p> 

<h3>What else can I do to help end hunger?</h3>

<p>Here are three things you can do to help end hunger. All are free and easy to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>To learn how to take action in your community, click <a href="http://www.friendsofwfp.org/site/c.hrKJIXPFIqE/b.5018831/k.F957/Volunteer.htm">here</a>.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 18px;">Add your name to the <a href="http://www.one.org/">One Campaign</a>,
where several million people have already joined together .as One. to
end hunger and extreme poverty. If enough people join, dreams for a
better world can be made into reality very quickly.</li>
<li style="margin-top: 18px;">Twenty-two countries have joined together to try to raise enough money to <em>end world hunger completely</em>
by each contributing 0.7% (less than 1%) of national income. Some of
the countries have already met this goal. Others haven.t come that far
yet. You can see how the countries are doing <a href="http://www.poverty.com/internationalaid.html">here</a>. You can print a letter to support your country's participation <a href="http://www.poverty.com/printletter.html">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Where can I learn more about hunger?</h3>

<p>One last important thing you can do to help  <a href="http://www.wfp.org/hunger">end hunger</a> is to become knowledgeable about it. A good way to do this is to visit WFP, our sister site <a href="http://www.poverty.com/">Poverty.com</a>, or one of the many excellent sites listed <a href="http://www.poverty.com/more.html">here</a>.  We believe that when enough people around the world become knowledgeable about hunger, it will no longer be tolerated.</p>
