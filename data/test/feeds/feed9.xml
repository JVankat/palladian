<p>My thanks to Navel Labs for sponsoring this week&#8217;s DF RSS feed to promote ReadMore. ReadMore is an iPhone app that works as a reading log &#8212; a diary of your reading habits and a motivational aid to get through more books. It tracks your reading sessions, holds your notes, and gently prods you to, well, read more. Think of it as Nike Plus for reading. And: it looks great.</p>

<p>Check out the demo video on the website to see how it works. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=353047317&amp;mt=8">Buy ReadMore on the App Store</a> for just $2.</p>

<p>CNN buried the most interesting tidbit in this piece on the results of a Yankee Group survey:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>77% of iPhone owners say they&#8217;ll buy another iPhone, compared to 20% of Android customers who say they&#8217;ll buy another Android phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s incredible, if accurate.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Geoff Duncan, writing for TidBITS back in 1998:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple already had a scripting language and authoring tool in
  HyperCard, and it was soon a done deal. HyperCard 3.0 would be
  re-implemented on top of QuickTime using QuickTime data formats,
  turning HyperCard 3.0 into an editor for interactive QuickTime
  movies. Projects authored in HyperCard would inherit all of
  QuickTime&#8217;s color capabilities and would work in any application
  &#8212; and on any platform &#8212; that supported QuickTime. The
  beleaguered, enervated HyperCard group became part of the
  high-profile, well-funded QuickTime group, and HyperCard
  aficionados rejoiced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That HyperCard 3.0 existed and was built entirely on top of QuickTime is not a rumor. Apple was a very different company in the &#8217;90s, and they showed development versions of HyperCard 3.0 in public several times. But then it was killed. <a href="http://macintouch.com/hypercard.html">Here&#8217;s a discussion thread on MacInTouch</a> from 2002 wherein several people claim HyperCard 3.0 was &#8220;Steved&#8221; &#8212; that Jobs killed it because he &#8220;thought you could do everything in Cocoa and ProjectBuilder that you could do with HyperCard.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s one explanation. But I&#8217;ve also heard stories that Macromedia pressured Apple to kill it &#8212; more or less telling Apple that if they shipped HyperCard 3.0, Macromedia would drop support for the Mac OS from Shockwave and, yes, Flash. If any readers out there know more about this story, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/contact/">I&#8217;d love to hear it</a>. Confidentiality guaranteed.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Two little birdies with good memories &#8212; and, as they say, familiarity with the matter &#8212; have written to state that it was killed simply as part of 1998 Apple&#8217;s belt-tightening refocusing of the company on core, essential products and technology. And one suggested that HyperCard 3.0 wasn&#8217;t nearly as close to being ready to ship as some reports suggested.</p>

<p>Chris Foresman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For current iPhone 4 users who want a new Bumper or other case, you&#8217;ll have to download the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iphone-4-case-program/id383941000?mt=8">iPhone 4 Case Program app</a> from the App Store. When the app launches, you sign in with your Apple ID, and you&#8217;ll be presented with a selection of cases to choose from. Currently you can choose either a black Bumper or one of seven cases from InCase, Belkin, Griffin, and Speck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doing it through an app is a clever idea. Also interesting: only the black bumper is available through this program.</p>

<summary type="html">So I get another call from my payola rep at Apple.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>So I get another call from my payola rep at Apple, and she&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, thanks so much for all the antenna-related links over the weekend. I just wanted to let you know how much we appreciate it, John.&#8221; They punctuate a lot of their sentences with your first name. Oldest trick in the book, but it works, even if you&#8217;re aware of it. Seriously. Anyway, I&#8217;m all like, &#8220;No problem, it&#8217;s my pleasure. You just keep those checks coming.&#8221; Laughs all around.</p>

<p>But then she gets serious, and says Apple will make it worth my while if I&#8217;d close out this antenna saga with a &#8220;Jackass of the Week&#8221; piece responding to Dan Lyons&#8217;s Antennagate story. So I say, &#8220;Who&#8217;d he write that for? I didn&#8217;t see anything on the Fake Steve blog about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She says, &#8220;Newsweek, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought they went out of business a few months ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re still around. I swear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sends me a link to Lyons&#8217;s piece, &#8220;<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/16/apple-s-rotten-reponse.html">Apple&#8217;s Rotten Response</a>&#8221;, which starts like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wonder if panic has started to set in at Apple yet. If not, it
  should. Because today’s hastily called news conference &#8212;
  ostensibly to discuss problems with iPhone 4 and how Apple intends
  to fix them &#8212; only did further damage to Apple’s reputation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is a polite way to start, because, well, we all know just how panicked everyone at Apple is feeling these days about the company&#8217;s prospects. (You&#8217;d be surprised at how many of the senior VPs at last week&#8217;s event reeked of booze, and it was only 10am. Nerves are frayed.) Lyons was kind to phrase it as a question.</p>

<p>So what should Apple be panicked about? Lyons&#8217;s thesis is that Steve Jobs has lost touch with reality, and the world is waking up to this. In this case, there&#8217;s something terribly wrong with the iPhone 4 antenna and Steve Jobs won&#8217;t admit it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some expected Apple might announce a recall of the phone. Others
  speculated it might announce some kind of software update that
  would improve reception problems. Instead, Apple CEO Steve Jobs
  came up with a two-part solution. Part 1: There is no problem.
  Part 2: Even though there is no problem, we’re going to give
  everyone a free case, which should insulate the antenna and
  prevent the interference that we just told you isn’t actually
  occurring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went back through my notes on the press conference, looking for the part where Jobs said there was no problem. I think it was right around the 13:00 mark in <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/july-2010/">the video stream</a>, where Jobs said, &#8220;And so the iPhone antenna went through all of this. We tested it. We knew that if you gripped it in a certain way, the bars are going to go down a little bit, just like every smartphone. We didn&#8217;t think it&#8217;d be a big problem, because every smartphone has this issue.&#8221; Or maybe it was a little later, toward the end, when Jobs said &#8220;A lot of people have told us, the bumper solves the signal strength problem,&#8221; where he claimed there was &#8220;no problem&#8221;.</p>

<p>So, Lyons concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is classic Apple behavior. No matter what the whole world can
  see with its own eyes, just keep saying that it isn’t true, and
  maybe, eventually, everyone will believe you. By refusing to
  acknowledge the problem, Jobs just reinforced the image of Apple
  as a company that is in deep denial and unable to admit a
  mistake &#8212; a company that has for so long been able to bend reality
  to suit its needs that it now has lost touch with reality itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read that paragraph aloud to my payola rep, and told her that it was exactly why I&#8217;d be reluctant to criticize Lyons&#8217;s coverage. Apple really should have acknowledged reality. Sure, they&#8217;re giving out free cases because &#8212; in Jobs&#8217;s words &#8212; &#8220;A lot of people have told us, the bumper solves the signal strength problem&#8221;. Sure, Jobs said Apple &#8220;knew that if you gripped it in a certain way, the bars are going to go down a little bit&#8221;. Sure, the overwhelming majority of iPhone 4 owners seems delighted with it. But where&#8217;s the acknowledgement that the iPhone 4 antenna is this year&#8217;s <em>Ishtar</em>? Where&#8217;s the product recall? Where&#8217;s the &#8220;KICK ME&#8221; sign on Steve Jobs&#8217;s black shirt? Why does Bob Mansfield still have a job?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jobs also said all other mobile phones suffer the same problems
  when you hold them in certain ways, and that “it’s a challenge
  to the entire industry.”</p>
  
  <p>That’s ridiculous. It’s absurd. But that’s nothing new.
  Apple has a history of making ridiculous claims and having them
  accepted by an adoring fan base and worshipful press.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s the uncomfortable truth. The last honest man is Dan Lyons. <a href="http://www.apple.com/antenna/">Those videos from Apple</a> showing other phones dropping bars? Fake. The <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/07/18/">similar videos</a> on YouTube <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/07/19/">from owners</a> of competing phones? Fake. Next thing Apple&#8217;s going to tell us, the Droid X has a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/20/verizon-confirms-droid-x-screen-issues-but-says-theyre-not-wid/">flaky display</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the launch of iPhone 4, for example, Apple pretended it had
  invented video chat &#8212; something that has been around elsewhere
  for years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lyons doesn&#8217;t name all those phones on which people are video chatting every day, because he doesn&#8217;t need to. Just look around and see them for yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real issue here is how the product is perceived. If you need
  to put a rubber case on a phone to make it work correctly, there
  must be something wrong with it, don’t you think?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly. I mean, if the truth were that, in practice, the iPhone 4 works just fine <em>without</em> a case for most people &#8212; that it gets faster downloads and uploads and voice call quality is improved over the 3GS &#8212; well, that&#8217;d be a different story entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jobs clearly doesn’t. He seems scornful of customers who have complained. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t show up on the video, but there was spittle coming out of Jobs&#8217;s mouth when he talked about the 0.55 percent of iPhone 4 owners who&#8217;d called Apple to complain about its reception. He seemed very upset about their gall.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Toward the end of the news conference, he blamed the media for
  blowing the problem out of proportion.</p>
  
  <p>Apple’s rivals will have a field day with this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, one week out, this is looking like very good news indeed for Apple&#8217;s rivals. Apple&#8217;s goose is cooked and Lyons knows the score. People are going to look back at this piece a year from now and say, &#8220;By god, Dan Lyons saw it all along.&#8221; (Seriously: bookmark it.) It&#8217;s bad enough that I don&#8217;t have the courage to call Apple out on this blatant chicanery; the last thing I&#8217;m going to do is put my name on the line and argue that he&#8217;s a big dummy with a chip on his shoulder and that his work exemplifies the state <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/business/media/06newsweek.html">Newsweek is in</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure you won&#8217;t do it? We really think you could knock it out of the park,&#8221; my payola rep pleads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry. Won&#8217;t touch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pretty dramatic performance difference. I think Android 2.2&#8217;s JavaScript performance gains are from JIT compilation, which isn&#8217;t possible under iOS 4.0 because of a security feature where once a page in memory is marked writeable, it can never be made executable. It&#8217;s a nice security feature, but one that comes at the expense of significant potential performance gains.</p>

  <p>That is exactly what the Chinese mobile industry is doing with

  <p>In effect, they are using Android—but not Google&#8217;s Android. They
  don&#8217;t need Google&#8217;s Android Market and they aren&#8217;t necessarily
  integrating with Google&#8217;s search or other services. When you think

<p>Priya Ganapati:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Samsung’s Vibrant phone that launched last week on T-Mobile is a
  good example. The device includes apps such as Mobi TV, GoGo
  Flight internet and Electronic Arts’ The Sims 3 game. Both Mobi
  TV and GoGo are applications that require users to pay a fee
  beyond the trial period. Motorola’s Backflip phone, introduced
  on AT&amp;T a few months ago, includes Where, a location-based service
  app, and YPMobile, a Yellow Pages app. Even the HTC Evo is packed
  with programs such as Sprint’s Nascar app, Sprint Football and
  Sprint TV, among others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems more clear now why Google made the Nexus One: it&#8217;s hard to get a phone with the default Android OS. It also seems clear that Android&#8217;s openness is largely about being open to the carriers&#8217; ability to customize the user experience. The difference between Android and iOS isn&#8217;t that Android comes with undeletable default apps and iOS doesn&#8217;t. Lots of iPhone users wish they could get rid of apps like Stocks and Weather. The difference is who gets to decide on those default apps. With iOS, it&#8217;s Apple. With the Nexus One, it was Google. With these new Android phones, it&#8217;s the carriers.</p>

<p>Andy Zaky:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, when Microsoft reports second quarter calendar results
  after the bell this afternoon, its likely that Apple will have
  surpassed Microsoft in revenue for the first time in the
  company’s recent history &#8212; and that it will continue to do so
  in the future. Apple reported $3.25 billion in net income ($3.51)
  on a whopping $15.7 billion in revenue on Tuesday, smashing
  analyst expectations, and reporting more or less in line with my
  forecast.</p>
  
  <p>Microsoft, on the other hand, is expected to earn $4.1 billion in
  net income ($0.46 in EPS) on $15.26 billion in revenue when it
  releases results after the bell today. That is nearly $500 million
  less than what Apple reported in revenue this quarter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple passed Microsoft in market cap a few months ago, and now revenue this quarter. The big one is net income &#8212; profit &#8212; and it&#8217;s looking like that might happen within the next year.</p>

<summary type="html">A few follow-up points regarding yesterday&apos;s piece.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>A few follow-up points from yesterday&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/antennagate_bottom_line">Antennagate Bottom Line</a>&#8221;:</p>

<h2>Regarding the Delta in Dropped Calls Between iPhone 4 and 3GS</h2>

<p>One theory to explain this would be that the iPhone 4 antenna is simply worse than the 3GS&#8217;s antenna, perhaps even only because of skin coming into contact with the infamous spot. </p>

<p>Jobs&#8217;s &#8220;pet theory&#8221; is that iPhone 3GS owners were far more likely to have a case than 4 owners, which, interestingly, implies that even the iPhone 3GS gets better reception when in a case. (I asked about this during the tour of their antenna labs; the answer I got was &#8220;We don&#8217;t know.&#8221;)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another one, though, suggested by at least a dozen DF readers so far. Quoting from one such email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Antennagate Bottom Line, you mention the comparison of numbers
  of dropped calls, but I argue that this is not the right metric.
  What one needs to know is if the iPhone4 drops a call that would
  not be dropped by a 3GS. If the additional drops are in areas that
  the 3GS would have never connected in the first place, then the
  statistic isn&#8217;t telling us what everyone claims it is. All that
  would mean is that there is a large drop rate in regions that were
  previously regarded as dead zones. That&#8217;s an improvement, not a
  regression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ll go out and acknowledge that this line of thinking is arguing that the iPhone 4&#8217;s higher dropped call rate is a good thing, which, on its face, sounds nutty. But is it outlandish? There are widespread reports &#8212; <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/3794/the-iphone-4-review/2">none better than Anandtech&#8217;s</a> &#8212; that the iPhone 4 gets usable reception in areas where previous iPhones got none. Those may well comprise many of the extra dropped calls.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also only fair to point out that I&#8217;ve also gotten many emails from DF readers who say they drop more calls with their iPhone 4 than their previous iPhones, from the same locations. I&#8217;ve gotten more such emails from readers claiming the iPhone 4 gets <em>better</em> reception, but for some, it&#8217;s worse. One thing I&#8217;d feel safe betting on: the extra dropped calls from the iPhone 4 are not evenly distributed among all iPhone 4 users. Some are getting a lot, and most are getting very few.</p>

<h2>Regarding Apple&#8217;s Field Testing of the Antenna</h2>

<p>Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve probably gotten at least 200 emails posing the following theory:</p>

<p><em>We know from the Gizmodo stolen iPhone that the prototypes were disguised in cases when outside Apple&#8217;s campus. Maybe that&#8217;s why Apple missed this flaw in the antenna: they never noticed it on campus because they have a strong AT&amp;T signal, and never noticed it off campus because the iPhones were always inside cases, and cases mitigate the skin-touching-the-spot problem.</em></p>

<p>That&#8217;s just not possible.</p>

<p>For one thing, the strength of the AT&amp;T coverage on Apple&#8217;s campus has no bearing on the testing they perform in their lab. There is no signal from AT&amp;T inside <a href="http://www.apple.com/antenna/testing-lab.html">those anechoic chambers</a>. There is no signal from any external wireless source in those chambers. That&#8217;s the point of them. The way the chambers work is that they create their own little mini network <em>inside</em> the chamber. They run tests where they create strong signals, weak signals, and everything in between. They also run tests with people holding the phones being tested.</p>

<p>For another, they do test antennas in the field off-campus with no case. They do so using a fleet of about a dozen mobile testing labs. These are vans &#8212; more like small buses, maybe &#8212; which contain a slew of testing and measurement equipment.</p>

<p>The iPhone Gizmodo obtained was, in Apple&#8217;s internal lingo, a Design Verification Test (DVT) unit. These are one step below production units. My understanding is that when DVT units are deemed ready to go, the factories start churning them out as actual production units. Those DVT field tests are the <em>final</em> tests, certainly not the only tests. During the tour of Apple&#8217;s labs, Ruben Caballero &#8212; Apple&#8217;s senior antenna engineer, who led the tour &#8212; said the iPhone 4 antenna design had been in testing for two years.</p>

<p>Lastly, here&#8217;s what Steve Jobs said during the press conference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again you have to build these rooms, because if you don&#8217;t shield
  what you&#8217;re testing from all the outside interference, you don&#8217;t
  get accurate tests. And you can&#8217;t put your equipment in the room
  either. The equipment&#8217;s all got to be remoted outside the room.
  Now this is a state of the art antenna test facility. We have 17
  anechoic chambers. These things are not cheap. We have invested
  over $100 million in antenna testing facilities over the past 5 years. We
  have 18 PhD scientists and engineers on our staff.</p>
  
  <p>And so the iPhone antenna went through all of this. We tested it.
  We knew that if you gripped it in a certain way, the bars are
  going to go down a little bit, just like every smartphone. We
  didn&#8217;t think it&#8217;d be a big problem, because every smartphone has
  this issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I thought the entire point of the lab tour was to reinforce this point: the iPhone 4 antenna is behaving exactly as Apple expected it would.</p>

<h2>Laying It All on the Line</h2>

<p>I posited yesterday that Jobs&#8217;s peevishness while announcing the free case giveaway had to do with the profits Apple is going to lose, which I estimated conservatively at $100 million. (On the analyst conference call yesterday afternoon, <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/215492-apple-inc-f3q10-qtr-end-06-26-10-earnings-call-transcript">Apple estimated the cost at $175 million</a>.) What I didn&#8217;t write about was whether I thought this was a good idea or not. I say yes.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. Early last week this antenna story was spinning out of control. Letterman made a Top Ten list about it. Consumer Reports was posting updates every day, each getting a lot of traffic. CNN.com had a front page story stating that iPhone 4 owners could &#8220;fix&#8221; their phones with strips of duct tape.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s possible that if Apple had done nothing, the story would have died by now, perhaps drowned out by Apple&#8217;s spectacular quarterly results announced yesterday. I think they decided it wasn&#8217;t worth the chance &#8212; that if they did nothing, the fire might have gotten worse rather than died out.</p>

<p>And I think they decided, wisely, that if they were going to hit back in response to the story, they should hit back with everything they had. No use dribbling out responses one at a time. So: a live press conference, not just an open letter from Steve Jobs; a new section on Apple&#8217;s website specifically explaining Apple&#8217;s argument, and revealing their heretofore secret antenna testing facility; and, yes, free cases, for iPhone 4 users who are having signal problems that go away when the phone is encased.</p>

<p>In short: they weren&#8217;t going to take any chances. Except they <em>did</em> take a chance, insofar as  Jobs mixed in a second message: media criticism. The message Apple needed to make was about the antenna (<em>yes it has a weak spot, but it&#8217;s a worthwhile trade-off and it isn&#8217;t resulting in product returns, support calls to AppleCare, or a spectacular number of increased dropped calls</em>) and about their concern for customers (<em>we want them to be happy, so we&#8217;re waiving the restocking fee on returns and we&#8217;re giving a free case to any iPhone 4 user who wants one</em>). </p>

<p>The extra message Jobs delivered was to the media: that they botched this story, that coverage was &#8220;so overblown it&#8217;s incredible&#8221;. Surely that&#8217;s what Jobs actually believes, and I think it&#8217;s the truth. I don&#8217;t think it was a good idea for Apple to make that case at the event, though. If the Antennagate PR problem was so dangerous that it warranted a significant response from Apple &#8212; and I think it did &#8212; then it was dangerous enough that it shouldn&#8217;t have been mixed with a message that might further antagonize the media &#8212; the very media whom Apple was clearly hoping would spread the facts Apple had presented regarding the antenna and its concern for customer satisfaction. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether Jobs was right; it distracted from the core message, which was all about dissipating the meme that the iPhone 4 antenna is severely flawed.</p>

<summary type="html">It&apos;s telling that the criticism surrounding this issue has shifted, quickly, from speculation about a technical defect in the iPhone 4 hardware to criticism over the tone of Apple&apos;s response to it.</summary>

<p>What is not in dispute: the iPhone 4 antenna has a weak spot in the lower-left corner of the frame, marked by the black line in the frame. When covered by your hand, this antenna suffers from attenuation. This is much like other smartphones. Further, because the antenna is external, the iPhone 4 can suffer from a <em>different</em> kind of &#8220;holding it wrong&#8221; signal loss: <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/article/11435">bridging the gap</a> on the lower left corner of the antenna with your skin.</p>

<p>This conductive bridging issue is either (a) a critical design flaw that never should have been released, and renders the iPhone 4 a dud product; or, (b) a minor problem resulting from a reasonable design trade-off, different but no worse, in practice, than the &#8220;regular&#8221; signal attenuation seen in most smartphones, including the iPhone 3GS, and weak spot or no, it&#8217;s no reason not to buy one.</p>

<p>In short, (a) implies the iPhone 4 antenna is a design that Apple should regret; (b) implies it is not.</p>

<p>Apple, obviously, says it&#8217;s (b). They backed this up on Friday with three pieces of &#8220;hard data&#8221;:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Only 0.55 percent of iPhone 4 owners have called AppleCare to report problems with reception.</p></li>
<li><p>The return rate to AT&amp;T stores for the iPhone 4 is 1.7 percent, compared to 6.0 percent for the iPhone 3GS during its first month on the market. (According to Jobs, even the 3GS&#8217;s 6.0 percent return rate is considered good for a smartphone.)</p></li>
<li><p>According to AT&amp;T&#8217;s data, the iPhone 4 indeed drops more calls than the 3GS, but the difference is less than one call per hundred.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Are there some iPhone 4 users for whom this problem is significant? Yes. Will the free cases and offer of a full refund suffice? It seems so. In terms of practical real-world effect, the worst you can say about it is that it tends to drop about one more call per hundred than the 3GS.</p>

<p>Now, you can argue that that&#8217;s a euphemistic way of presenting the call-drop statistic. Farhad Manjoo, in his coverage of Antennagate for Slate (headline: &#8220;<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2260619/pagenum/all/">Here&#8217;s Your Free Case, Jerk</a>&#8221;), writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Jobs did admit this fact in his press conference, he mangled
  the stats to make the iPhone 4&#8217;s dropped call increase look minor.
  &#8220;The iPhone 4 drops less than one additional call per 100 than the
  3GS,&#8221; he said. As Jobs sees it, that&#8217;s not a big rise in dropped
  calls. Yet that&#8217;s not an obvious conclusion. Last year, an AT&amp;T
  spokesman told me that AT&amp;T&#8217;s average iPhone dropped-call rate is
  1 percent &#8212; in other words, the old iPhone dropped one call out of
  100. If the iPhone 4 drops nearly one additional call out of 100,
  that could be close to a 2 percent dropped-call rate &#8212; or double
  the dropped-call rate of the old iPhone. That sounds a lot more
  serious, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jobs stated during the event that, for competitive reasons, AT&amp;T would not allow Apple to reveal the absolute dropped call rate &#8212; only the delta between the dropped call rate of the 3GS and 4. I think it&#8217;s safe to say most people would consider a number of, say, 5 percent to be shockingly high, even with AT&amp;T&#8217;s reputation. And at the other end, I&#8217;d have a hard time believing that the 3GS&#8217;s dropped call rate was significantly lower than 1 percent. So the increase in dropped calls for the iPhone 4 must range between twice as many to 1.2 times as many. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0210022">an academic paper by M.V. Simkin and J. Olness</a> (PDF, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1523761">via this thread on Hacker News</a>) which estimates the mean industry-wide dropped call rate to be 2.4 percent &#8212; all phones on all carriers. The paper was published in 2002, however, so it&#8217;s impossible to say how applicable it is to the industry-wide dropped call rate in 2010. But it sets a reasonable baseline &#8212; a baseline that suggests a &#8220;less than 1 per hundred&#8221; increase in dropped calls is, though disappointing, not particularly alarming.</p>

<p>[<strong>Update, 21 July 2010:</strong> According to slide 11 of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/07/21/att-antennagate">this PDF presentation from AT&amp;T back in January</a>, their network-wide dropped call rate for 3G was 0.91 percent.]</p>

<p>I have a theory, by the way, for why Jobs sounded a tad annoyed &#8212; that is, a tad <em>more</em> annoyed than his already annoyed tone throughout the entire event &#8212; when announcing Apple&#8217;s offer of free cases for all iPhone 4 owners through September 30. I&#8217;ve seen many argue that the existence of Apple&#8217;s bumpers is an indication that Apple knew all along that the iPhone 4 had reception problems that were alleviated by a case (e.g. <a href="http://www.mondaynote.com/2010/07/18/antennagate-if-you-can’t-fix-it-feature-it/">Jean-Louis Gassée yesterday</a>). I think it&#8217;s simpler than that, and requires no less cynicism to believe.</p>

<p>After revealing that the iPhone 4 has a slightly higher dropped called rate than the 3GS, Jobs said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Even less than one is too much for us. We&#8217;re trying to find out
  why. We want to drive this <em>lower</em> than the 3GS. But this does put
  it in perspective. So, I have my own pet theory on this, which we
  have no proof of, but I&#8217;ll give it to you anyway. When the iPhone
  3GS came out, we did not change the design from the iPhone 3, and
  there was a healthy market of cases for the iPhone 3G that fit the
  3GS perfectly because the design didn&#8217;t change. And in our stores,
  80 percent of the iPhone 3GS users walked out with a case. iPhone
  4 has a radically new design; none of the old cases fit. Since we
  didn&#8217;t show it to anybody, none of the new cases are ready, and we
  can&#8217;t make enough of our bumper cases. And so in our stores, about
  20 percent of the people are going out with a case. And I think
  that has something to do with this disparity.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for the 3GS, when cases were in plentiful supply at the debut, 80 percent of iPhone buyers at Apple stores walked out with a case. I think Apple wanted in on that market. And because the 4 needs different cases than the 3G/3GS, Apple had the iPhone 4 case market <em>all</em> to itself for a few weeks, and <em>mostly</em> to itself for a few months. At $29 a pop retail, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a stretch to think that Apple saw this as a $100 million opportunity &#8212; say, 5 million bumpers at $20 profit apiece. They could have made money with their own cases a year ago with the 3GS, but nowhere near as much as they could have now, as the only case in town that fits the iPhone 4.</p>

<p>Put in context, the fancy secret antenna testing lab Apple revealed Friday cost, said Jobs, about $100 million. Now, Apple&#8217;s a multi-billion dollar company. A few hours ago they released <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/07/20results.html">quarterly results</a> showing them making over a billion dollars in <em>profit</em> per month. So $100 million isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> big a deal. But the way you get to be a billion dollar company is by having a nose for opportunities. $100 million is $100 million. So if you want to know why Jobs sounded annoyed when he said (around the 25:25 mark of <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/july-2010/">the video feed</a>), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just give everybody a case? OK. Great. Let&#8217;s give everybody a case,&#8221; well, I think you can explain why he sounds peeved by reading that quote as, &#8220;<em>Why don&#8217;t you just give away $100 million? OK. Great. Let&#8217;s give away $100 million.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>Anyway, bottom line on the iPhone 4 antenna: it has a weak spot but there&#8217;s no evidence that it&#8217;s a significant, let alone catastrophic, problem in practice. It&#8217;s telling that the criticism surrounding this issue has shifted, quickly, from speculation about a technical defect in the iPhone 4 hardware to <a href="http://www.appleoutsider.com/2010/07/17/townhall/">criticism</a> over the <a href="http://unweary.com/2010/07/antennagate.html">tone</a> of Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1321/surviving-success">response</a> to it.</p>

<p>Source: &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/07/02appleletter.html">Letter From Apple Regarding iPhone 4</a>&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The iPhone 4 has been the most successful product launch in
  Apple’s history. It has been judged by reviewers around the
  world to be the best smartphone ever, and users have told us that
  they love it. So we were surprised when we read reports of
  reception problems, and we immediately began investigating them.
  Here is what we have learned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We cannot believe we had to write this fucking letter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To start with, gripping almost any mobile phone in certain ways
  will reduce its reception by 1 or more bars. This is true of
  iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, as well as many Droid, Nokia and RIM phones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We cannot believe we&#8217;re getting shit for this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But some users have reported that iPhone 4 can drop 4 or 5 bars
  when tightly held in a way which covers the black strip in the
  lower left corner of the metal band. This is a far bigger drop
  than normal, and as a result some have accused the iPhone 4 of
  having a faulty antenna design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(No translation necessary.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time, we continue to read articles and receive
  hundreds of emails from users saying that iPhone 4 reception is
  better than the iPhone 3GS. They are delighted. This matches our
  own experience and testing. What can explain all of this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really is a better antenna and <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/3794/the-iphone-4-review/2">gets better reception</a>, overall, than any previous iPhone. That&#8217;s really the hell of this whole goddamn situation. It&#8217;s like a <em>two steps forward, one step back</em> design, except maybe more like three steps forward, because this thing is faster at downloading, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/iphone_4_3g_performance">10 times faster at uploading</a>, and most importantly is better at not dropping calls with a weak signal. But, yes, there&#8217;s that one step back, wherein it can suffer from unintended attenuation when you bridge the lower-left antenna gap with your skin, and frankly, we&#8217;re a little pissed that this one step back is getting all the attention.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have discovered the cause of this dramatic drop in bars, and it
  is both simple and surprising.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are going to blame AT&amp;T.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we
  use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is
  totally wrong. Our formula, in many instances, mistakenly displays
  2 more bars than it should for a given signal strength. For
  example, we sometimes display 4 bars when we should be displaying
  as few as 2 bars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We decided from the outset to <a href="http://fscked.co.uk/post/754590440/this-infographic-hopefully-shows-that-im-not">set the formula for our bars-of-signal strength indicator</a> to make the iPhone look good &#8212; to make it look as if it &#8220;gets more bars&#8221;. That decision has now bitten us on our ass.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Users observing a drop of several bars when they
  grip their iPhone in a certain way are most likely in an area with
  very weak signal strength, but they don’t know it because we are
  erroneously displaying 4 or 5 bars. Their big drop in bars is
  because their high bars were never real in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, with no case on the phone, your signal strength can drop by about 20 or even 30 percent depending how you hold the phone. We&#8217;re going to change the bar algorithm so that you&#8217;ll only lose one bar (maybe two, if you&#8217;re holding the phone obnoxiously tight or have gross sweaty palms) if you&#8217;re holding it that way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To fix this, we are adopting AT&amp;T’s recently recommended formula
  for calculating how many bars to display for a given signal
  strength. The real signal strength remains the same, but the
  iPhone’s bars will report it far more accurately, providing
  users a much better indication of the reception they will get in a
  given area. We are also making bars 1, 2 and 3 a bit taller so
  they will be easier to see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are braced for the backlash when, after installing this update, people who weren&#8217;t experiencing any problems at all with their iPhones start complaining, loudly, that their phones which used to get five bars now only get three or two or whatever from the same locations, and we all know &#8212; us and everyone reading this &#8212; that Gizmodo will immediately declare that the update has made iPhone 4 reception worse, even though we&#8217;ve just explained that we&#8217;re not changing anything related to <em>actual</em> reception, but rather only to how we <em>indicate</em> signal strength.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We will issue a free software update within a few weeks that
  incorporates the corrected formula. Since this mistake has been
  present since the original iPhone, this software update will also
  be available for the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 3G.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(No translation necessary.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have gone back to our labs and retested everything, and the
  results are the same &#8212; the iPhone 4’s wireless performance is
  the best we have ever shipped. For the vast majority of users who
  have not been troubled by this issue, this software update will
  only make your bars more accurate. For those who have had
  concerns, we apologize for any anxiety we may have caused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#8217;t fuck this thing up for us. We mean, have you <em>seen</em> the Retina Display?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a reminder, if you are not fully satisfied, you can return your
  undamaged iPhone to any Apple Retail Store or the online Apple
  Store within 30 days of purchase for a full refund.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We dare you.</p>

<p>And take your <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2010/07/01/apple-att-sued-over-iphone-4-reception/">class action suits</a> filed four days after we released the goddamn thing and stick them up your fucking asses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We hope you love the iPhone 4 as much as we do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, have you <em>seen</em> it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for your patience and support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#8217;t hold it that way, or buy a case.</p>

<summary type="html">Benchmarking 3G data performance on the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and iPad 3G.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/2444024,iphone4-ihnatko-review-apple-062810.article">Andy Ihnatko&#8217;s iPhone 4 review</a>, I was intrigued by his comments regarding the phone&#8217;s significantly faster 3G data performance, with improved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Speed_Downlink_Packet_Access">HSDPA</a> (download) support and brand-new support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Speed_Uplink_Packet_Access">HSUPA</a> (upload). So I ran some tests using the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fcc-mobile-broadband-test/id357119507?mt=8">FCC&#8217;s free mobile broadband test app</a>.</p>

<p>I tested three devices: an iPhone 4, and iPhone 3GS, and an iPad 3G. I ran three tests on each, and the numbers below are the average of three runs. (There wasn&#8217;t much variance in the results.)</p>

<table>
<thead>

  <td style="text-align: right;">13.43</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">4.33</td>
  <td style="text-align: right;">65</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>(For download and upload, higher scores are better. For latency, lower scores are better.)</p>

<p>I tested 3G performance on the iPhone 4 twice (three runs each) &#8212; once lying on a table, and once while held in my left hand, with my palm spanning the infamous lower-left antenna gap. I also tested it using my home 802.11n Wi-Fi network, connected to a Comcast cable modem.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m seeing download speeds twice as fast as on an iPhone 3GS, and upload speeds over <em>ten times</em> faster. Latency is about an order of magnitude better as well. The iPad doesn&#8217;t fare much better than the 3GS.</p>

<p>Holding the iPhone 4 in my hand drops the 3G download speed by about a third, but <em>it&#8217;s still faster than the 3GS</em>. Upload speed and latency didn&#8217;t seem affected by holding it in my hand.</p>

<summary type="html">A review of the iPhone 4.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The first thing you notice is that the iPhone 4 feels smaller in hand &#8212; the decrease in width, even more so than thickness, is quite noticeable. It feels tight.</p>

<p>Then you turn it on, and you see the screen.</p>

<p>Apple seems very confident about the precise size and dimensions of the iPhone display: 3.5 inches, with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Not 3 inches. Not 4 inches. In fact, Apple seems very confident regarding everything it decided for the original 2007 iPhone. There are no new buttons, or even <em>moved</em> buttons. The Retina Display is emblematic of the iPhone 4 as a whole, both hardware and software: the same fundamental idea as the original iPhone, but clarified. It hasn&#8217;t really changed so much as <em>improved</em> &#8212; like the same picture in increasingly sharper focus.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/iphone_4">As I wrote</a> after examining Apple&#8217;s iPhone 4 demo units after the WWDC keynote, the Retina Display&#8217;s overall effect is like that of high-end glossy  magazine print &#8212; except that it updates <em>live</em>. It&#8217;s living breathing print. I don&#8217;t recall ever having seen motion graphics of this resolution, anywhere. And (again as noted previously) it&#8217;s more than just the pixel resolution &#8212; it&#8217;s that the LCD is so much closer to the surface of the glass. Like pixels <em>on</em> glass rather than pixels <em>under</em> glass. This is the result of a new manufacturing process Apple has pioneered. No other company gives a shit about things like this.</p>

<p>The iPhone 4 feels like a major step toward an idealized iPhone form factor. What defines the iPhone, physically, is the 3.5-inch diagonal screen. The iPhone 4, in terms of width, seems about as narrow as you could possibly want it to be without reducing the size of the display itself. There&#8217;s just enough of a bezel around the sides to avoid inadvertent touches from fingers holding the phone by the edge. My older iPhones now feel swollen along their rounded edges. And yet somehow, despite making the form factor noticeably smaller, Apple made room internally for <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone-4-Teardown/3130/1">the battery to be <em>bigger</em></a>.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/iphone_3g">review of the iPhone 3G</a> two years ago, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The home button on the 3G seems to require a more forceful push.
  The clickiness of my original iPhone’s home button is better. On
  the other hand, the clickiness of the 3G’s volume and sleep
  buttons is better. Apple sometimes seems to be the lone consumer
  electronics company that pays any attention at all to the tactile
  response of buttons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The iPhone 4&#8217;s buttons are improved all around. The Home button restores the clickiness of the original iPhone&#8217;s. The new volume buttons, silence toggle, and power button all have a better feel than ever before. Apple is so good at making buttons, it&#8217;s almost enough to make one wish they made button-laden devices.</p>

<p>The overall build quality seems impossibly good. The iPhone 4 is beautiful to behold and feels like a valuable artifact. It&#8217;s like a love letter to Dieter Rams.</p>

<h2>The Flat Sides</h2>

<p>The flat sides make it feel much more like a real camera &#8212; a decidedly thin camera, but a camera nonetheless &#8212; while taking pictures. This improvement is equally noticeable when holding the camera horizontally for any reason &#8212; like, say, to watch video. When you&#8217;re holding a phone vertically, you&#8217;re typically cupping it in the palm of one hand. But when holding a phone horizontally, you typically pinch it between your forefinger and thumb. The iPhone 4&#8217;s flat sides make this grip far more secure.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>The iPhone 4 is definitely faster than the 3GS, but it doesn&#8217;t feel to me as though the difference is as noticeable as last year&#8217;s leap from the 3G to 3GS. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGu4h1vP3qM">This video on YouTube</a>, which compares the startup time for Plants vs. Zombies on an iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, and original iPhone, feels exactly right to me: the 4 is noticeably faster than the 3GS, which in turn is <em>way</em> faster than the original iPhone (and the 3G, which performance-wise was nearly identical to the original).</p>

<p>The big win for Apple&#8217;s A4 system-on-a-chip, I suspect, is not raw performance (even though it <em>is</em> faster), but rather performance-per-watt. It&#8217;s an even better balance between speed and power consumption. And, on a related point, the A4 system is physically smaller, which has enabled Apple to reduce the size of the iPhone form factor and <em>still</em> include a bigger battery.</p>

<p>Battery life seems a tad better on the iPhone 4 than the 3GS, which is saying something, given that the CPU is faster and the Retina Display packs four times as many pixels, is brighter, and offers a better contrast ratio.</p>

<p>Typing on the iPhone 4 keyboard seems better than ever. The increase in performance has made the iPhone 4 more responsive to touch events, and for me this is most evident while using the keyboard.</p>

<p>The increase in RAM from 256 to 512 MB is, no surprise, welcome. More web pages remain in memory in MobileSafari, and more apps remain resident in memory for fast app switching. The combination of more RAM and iOS 4&#8217;s new fast app switching makes the process of switching between a handful of apps feel like an all-new experience compared to older iPhones running OS 3.</p>

<h2>The Glass Back</h2>

<p>Both aesthetically and tactilely, the iPhone 4&#8217;s glass back is very pleasing. It has a <a href="http://www.google.com/images?&amp;q=2001+monolith">2001-monolith</a>-like symmetry. But as a heavy iPhone user since <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/iphone_first_impressions">day one</a>, I&#8217;m finding it slightly disconcerting. I&#8217;ve always carried my iPhone the same way: front right pants pocket, with the glass toward my body, so that if my leg hits something or something hits my leg, the back of the iPhone would take the impact, not the glass. Now it&#8217;s glass on both sides, and what keeps happening is that I reach into my pocket to take it out, my fingers feel the smooth glass facing <em>out</em>, and I think, &#8220;Shit, I pocketed my iPhone wrong last time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get used to it shortly, I suppose, but there&#8217;s really no way to distinguish the front from the back by touch other than to find the Home button or speaker.</p>

<p>And, for obvious reasons, the glass back raises concerns about the iPhone 4&#8217;s droppability. With previous iPhones, it was like dropping a piece of buttered toast &#8212; there was a lucky and unlucky side on which it could land. With the iPhone 4, it&#8217;s like dropping a piece of toast that&#8217;s been buttered on both sides.</p>

<h2>FaceTime</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t really talk on the phone that much, but I&#8217;ve had <a href="/misc/2010/06/facetime-sandy.jpg">fun</a> trying out FaceTime with a few iPhone 4-enabled friends. It truly is delightfully easy to initiate, whether by starting with a voice call or not.</p>

<p>The video quality is far smoother than anything I&#8217;ve ever gotten using Skype or over AIM with iChat &#8212; better resolution, far fewer compression artifacts, and almost no pauses or lag. It&#8217;s early in the game, but so far FaceTime seems best-of-breed technically.</p>

<p>Audio quality over FaceTime is excellent. This is particularly noticeable with calls that start using voice. The difference is so stark that it makes me wish FaceTime could kick in for audio-only calls between FaceTime-capable phones. AT&amp;T should be ashamed.</p>

<p>Portrait orientation looks perfectly natural for FaceTime, for the obvious reason that it frames the face like &#8212; duh &#8212; a portrait.</p>

<p>When you initiate a FaceTime call directly &#8212; by clicking the &#8220;FaceTime&#8221; button on a contact &#8212; you get an iChat-sounding &#8220;ringer&#8221; sound while waiting for the recipient to accept the call. If the recipient is not available for FaceTime (e.g. if their device is not currently connected to Wi-Fi), they will get a &#8220;missed FaceTime&#8221; notification pretty much just like what you get when you miss a phone call. This includes a notification alert on the lock screen, and an increase to the number in the Phone app&#8217;s red badge.</p>

<p>Voicemail would be great for these missed FaceTime-only calls, but it&#8217;s not there. (&#8220;Facemail&#8221;?)</p>

<p>When you switch to the home screen or another app during a FaceTime call, the video pauses, but the audio continues. Once you switch a call to FaceTime, you can&#8217;t switch back to voice-only, but switching to another app while the call continues effectively turns FaceTime into voice-only.</p>

<p>That FaceTime goes through the Phone app, rather than a dedicated FaceTime app, makes me wonder what Apple will do <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/facetime_ipod_touch">if I&#8217;m right</a> that this year&#8217;s upcoming new iPod Touches will be FaceTime-capable. My guess is that it&#8217;ll be sort of like with the iPhone&#8217;s &#8220;iPod&#8221; app, which on the iPod Touch is split into separate Music and Video apps: on the iPhone, FaceTime is subsumed by the Phone app, but on the iPod Touch, it could be its own standalone app.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that FaceTime, not the Retina Display, is apparently going to be the centerpiece of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/06/28/iphone-4-ad">Apple&#8217;s TV ads</a> for the iPhone 4. It is instantly compelling. It&#8217;s also the sort of thing that drives critics of Apple products nuts. &#8220;<em>Look at these stupid people who think Apple invented video chat, or even mobile video chat.</em>&#8221; <a href="http://www.jarober.com/blog/blogView?showComments=true&amp;printTitle=Someone_Hand_John_Gruber_a_Skype_Account&amp;entry=3454786348">Right?</a> What they&#8217;re overlooking, and will always overlook, is the value of the &#8220;It just works&#8221; factor. Normal people aren&#8217;t just going to use FaceTime &#8212; they&#8217;re going to love it.</p>

<p>And if it really takes off, it&#8217;ll turn FaceTime into a de facto social network. People will buy iPhone 4&#8217;s (or other future FaceTime devices) because two or more of their friends have them and they feel like they&#8217;re missing out. Mark these words: FaceTime goes down as one of the most important things Apple has ever introduced.</p>

<h2>Helvetica Neue</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s a subtle change, but Apple has changed the system font for the iPhone 4, from Helvetica to Helvetica Neue. The change is specific to the iPhone 4 hardware (or more specifically, the Retina Display), <em>not</em> iOS 4. On older iPhone hardware, iOS 4 still uses Helvetica as the system font.</p>

<p>If you think it&#8217;s hard to tell Helvetica apart from Arial, this one&#8217;s going to shoot right over your head. Helvetica Neue isn&#8217;t so much a different typeface as a &#8220;reworked&#8221; version of the same face. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/Ulc/4112/HelveticaOldNeue.htm">an overview of Helvetica&#8217;s history</a> from U&amp;LC. (And a <a href="http://typophile.com/node/15053">pronunciation thread on Typophile</a>.)</p>

<p>Says my friend and fellow Helvetica aficionado Mike Monteiro,<sup id="fnr1-2010-06-29"><a href="#fn1-2010-06-29">1</a></sup> &#8220;In comparison to Helvetica Neue, Helvetica looks ungainly. It&#8217;s 95 percent there. Neue took it the other 5 percent.&#8221;</p>

<p>In general, where Helvetica Neue differs from regular Helvetica, its glyphs are slightly wider and rounder. The most telling difference, to my eyes, is the uppercase bold M:</p>

<p><a href="/misc/2010/06/helvetica-v-helvetica-neue.png"><img
    src="/misc/2010/06/helvetica-v-helvetica-neue-thumb.png"
    alt="Comparison of uppercase M character in Helvetica and Helvetica Neue."
/></a></p>

<p>A good place to spot the difference, side-by-side with an older iPhone or iPod Touch, is the &#8220;AM/PM&#8221; in the status bar. On the iPhone 4, <a href="/misc/2010/06/iphone4-homescreen.jpg">it&#8217;s clearly Helvetica Neue</a> (with the wider M), and on an iPhone 3GS running iOS 4.0, <a href="/misc/2010/06/iphone3gs-homescreen.jpg">it is regular Helvetica</a>.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, this change is a win. Helvetica is a great typeface; long-time DF readers know I&#8217;m a huge fan of it, and the choice to use it for the iPhone&#8217;s system font is one of my favorite decisions in Apple history. But Helvetica Neue, subtle though its differences are, is a nice improvement. It is a more Helvetica-y Helvetica.</p>

<p>Why change <em>only</em> on the iPhone 4, though? I suspect it&#8217;s because Apple&#8217;s digital version of Helvetica is better <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting">hinted</a> for on-screen rasterization than Apple&#8217;s Helvetica Neue, which makes it look slightly sturdier on the relatively crude pre-Retina Display iPhone screen. I.e., Helvetica looks better than Helvetica Neue on older iPhones, but Helvetica Neue looks better on the truly-print-caliber Retina Display.</p>

<p>In the old days, there was print (high resolution) and screen (low resolution), and a wide resolution gap between them. The iPhone, and devices with similar pixel density, introduced a sort of middle ground &#8212; many print fonts that never looked good on screens before looked good on the iPhone. The iPhone 4, however, offers type rendering that is legitimately print quality.</p>

<p>That Apple pays so much attention to the details as to pick a different version of Helvetica for different classes of displays is emblematic of what makes the iPhone the iPhone &#8212; software and hardware that are designed in tandem as parts of a single whole.</p>

<h2>Helvetica Neue&#8217;s Missing Italics</h2>

<p>There is, however, one problem with Helvetica Neue in iOS 4.0: it doesn&#8217;t include italics. You can see this for yourself on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/misc/test/helvetica">this web page I&#8217;ve created</a> that specifies Helvetica and Helvetica Neue alongside each other, including spans of bold, italic, and bold italics.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how that test page renders in the following browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/misc/2010/06/helvetica-test-mac.png">Safari 5 on Mac OS X 10.6.4</a></li>
<li><a href="/misc/2010/06/helvetica-test-ipad.png">iPad running iOS 3.2</a></li>
<li><a href="/misc/2010/06/helvetica-test-iphone3gs.png">iPhone 3GS running iOS 4.0</a></li>
<li><a href="/misc/2010/06/helvetica-test-iphone4.png">iPhone 4 running iOS 4.0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It renders correctly on the Mac and iPad, but on both iPhones, the italic and bold italic variants of Helvetica Neue are not available, and render as non-italic.</p>

<p>I can only assume this is an oversight on Apple&#8217;s part. It affects <a href="http://nfarina.com/post/738543430/iphone-4-no-italics">iPhone developers who use the italic system font in their applications</a> &#8212; in all previous versions of iOS (née iPhone OS), <code>[UIFont italicSystemFontOfSize:]</code> returned an italic font; in iOS 4.0 it does not. The iPhone&#8217;s OS has long included several non-italic weights of Helvetica Neue. The iPad&#8217;s OS (version 3.2) was the first to include the italics. But iOS 4 only includes the same non-italic weights of Helvetica Neue from OS 3.1 and earlier. (Yet another sign of the divergence between the iPad&#8217;s and iPhone&#8217;s software.)<sup id="fnr2-2010-06-29"><a href="#fn1-2010-06-29">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve filed a <a href="https://bugreport.apple.com/">radar</a> on the issue (#<a href="rdar://8140283">8140283</a>), requesting that Apple add the italic weights of Helvetica Neue to a near-future iOS update. The iPhone should include all the same fonts as the iPad. (Those of you with Apple developer accounts who agree should file duplicate radars.)</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>

<p>I thought last year&#8217;s 3GS provided a nice improvement to the iPhone camera, with superior still photos and the addition of video. The new (primary) camera in the iPhone 4 is a bigger improvement. Still photos are of the quality of a low-end dedicated point-and-shoot camera, and the 720p video is surprisingly good. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/tags/iphone4example/">Here are a handful of stills and a video</a> I took over the weekend &#8212; none of them post-processed in any way.</p>

<p>The iPhone 4 adds a flash to the main camera. I suppose that&#8217;s nice, for when you absolutely can&#8217;t get a decent exposure in low light without it, but the new camera is sensitive enough that you can take pretty good photos in relatively low light without it. I&#8217;ve turned the flash on mine off, and don&#8217;t expect to turn it on more than a handful of times.</p>

<p>Is the video quality just as good as a dedicated 720p video camera like the Flip HD? <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/06/24/video-comparison">I say yes</a>. And at the very least, it is <em>very</em> close. Most impressively, video shot with the iPhone 4 doesn&#8217;t seem to suffer from any sort of lag or stuttering, even while panning or walking around. Playback, needless to say, is silky smooth.</p>

<p>More importantly, Flip-class cameras don&#8217;t offer online connectivity, and don&#8217;t offer on-device editing like the iPhone 4 does with iMovie. Flip&#8217;s not dead yet, because <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D13%26ref_%3Dnb%5Fsb%5Fnoss%26y%3D18%26field-keywords%3Dflip%2520hd%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics&amp;tag=daringfirebal-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">you can get an HD Flip for about $120</a>. One can imagine sending a class of sixth-graders out armed with a few school-owned Flips; that&#8217;s not going to happen with $499 iPhones. But my guess is that we&#8217;re going to see a similar camera in this year&#8217;s new $299 iPod Touch, which will be next year&#8217;s $199 iPod Touch. I think Apple is going to be able to get the price on such an iPod Touch below $200 before Cisco is going to create iMovie-like editing software for the Flip.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate just how many wildly-varied devices the iPhone and iPod Touch compete with. Phones and handheld audio/video players, yes, obviously. But now also cameras and handheld game consoles. It&#8217;s an old adage that the best camera is the one you have with you. It&#8217;s getting to the point now where the iPhone camera isn&#8217;t just good because it&#8217;s with you, but good because it&#8217;s actually pretty good.</p>

<h2>The Reception and Proximity Sensor Problems</h2>

<p>There are two widely-reported problems with the iPhone 4. First is the issue surrounding 3G reception and hand placement on the device. There&#8217;s <a href="http://vimeo.com/12864890">no doubt</a> that this is an issue for many &#8212; but I think a minority &#8212; of iPhone 4 owners. I haven&#8217;t been able to duplicate the problem on mine, though. Sometimes, but rarely, I can make it drop a single bar, but I can&#8217;t duplicate the drop to &#8220;No Signal&#8221; that many others can.</p>

<p>Best as I can tell, based on the reports I&#8217;ve read, including many emails from DF readers, the problem is multivariate. It definitely seems related to signal coverage (or cell tower proximity, or something like that). I&#8217;ve received many emails (and a <a href="http://twitter.com/mboylan/status/17040811728">few</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/camh/status/17297671186">tweets</a>) from DF readers who can reproduce the problem at will in one location, but can&#8217;t in another. Not much help, though, when the problematic location is, say, your home or workplace. But I&#8217;ve also heard from a few readers with fellow iPhone 4-owning friends and colleagues, who&#8217;ve been able to test several units side-by-side. Some iPhone 4 units seem more susceptible to the problem than others &#8212; which makes me question whether this is something a software update can address. I think it&#8217;s a combination of software and manufacturing.</p>

<p>The other issue regards the proximity sensor &#8212; the sensor which turns off the touchscreen when you hold the phone to your head for a call. The proximity sensor on the iPhone 4 seems far more sensitive than on previous iPhones, such that minor movements away from your head during a call re-enable the touchscreen, which then leads to your cheek inadvertently engaging the Mute or End Call buttons. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.everythingicafe.com/is-the-iphone-4s-proximity-sensor-causing-trouble/2010/06/25/">description of the problem at EverythingiCafe</a>; and here&#8217;s <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2475509&amp;start=0&amp;tstart=0">a 24-page (!) thread about it on Apple&#8217;s discussion forum</a>. This problem, I have seen myself. My cheek invoked the End Call button during a call yesterday, something that I don&#8217;t recall ever having happened in the three years I&#8217;ve been using iPhones. <a href="http://log.maniacalrage.net/post/750578654/paging-iphone-4-quality-assurance-team">Garrett Murray is afflicted by both</a> these problems.</p>

<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to see whether Apple is able to address either or both of these problems via a software update. And, if so, when? The iPad was released in April and still hasn&#8217;t seen a single software update. (Perhaps the iPad is an exception, and Apple has decided against a 3.2.1 iPad update to devote all of its iPad OS development time to iOS 4.1.)</p>

<p>The proximity sensor issue strikes me as more likely to be fixable via software. As for the reception issues, I can see this playing out three ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Best case:</strong> It&#8217;s fixable, or at least improvable, via software changes alone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OK case:</strong> It&#8217;s a manufacturing issue that Apple can address going forward, with future production runs. Apple has sold a lot of iPhone 4&#8217;s already, but most of the iPhone 4&#8217;s they&#8217;ll eventually sell haven&#8217;t yet been made. They might take a small hit on exchanges from existing iPhone 4 users who are seeing the problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Worst case:</strong> It&#8217;s inherent to the design of the iPhone 4&#8217;s novel external antennas, and all iPhone 4 units will be susceptible to the problem.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As I stated before, some people seeing the problem can&#8217;t reproduce it (or at least see lower amounts of signal loss) when they try using a different iPhone 4 unit in the same location. That suggests it&#8217;s fixable, but perhaps only in manufacturing, not in software for existing units. And even in the worst case scenario, it only seems to be a problem when holding the phone in certain ways <em>while in areas of marginal signal strength</em>. That&#8217;s not to pass the blame from Apple to AT&amp;T, but only to say <a href="http://fscked.co.uk/post/751030001/more-on-the-iphone-4-signal-issue">it&#8217;s far from catastrophic</a>. It may wind up being more of a publicity problem than a technical one. At the very least it isn&#8217;t going to help the iPhone&#8217;s perception as a great device but weak phone.</p>

<p>Also goes to show that iOS developers should be specifying the font for UI elements via API calls for the &#8220;system font&#8221;, rather than hard-coding for &#8220;Helvetica&#8221;.
