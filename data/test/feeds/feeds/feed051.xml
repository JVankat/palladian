<title>&lt;em&gt;JDR&lt;/em&gt; Symposium to Address Disputed Election Processes</title>
<link>http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/jdr/symposium.html&amp;utm_medium=newsRSS</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Bush v. Gore&lt;/em&gt; and, more recently, &lt;em&gt;Coleman v. Franken&lt;/em&gt;, made apparent the problems associated with judicial resolution of disputed elections, procedures for unraveling electoral disagreements remain uncertain and time consuming at both state and federal levels. On Feb. 18, the &lt;em&gt;Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution&lt;/em&gt; will host a symposium entitled: &amp;ldquo;Talking the Vote: Facility Disputed Election Processes through ADR.&amp;rdquo; This symposium will examine the methods currently used to resolve electoral disputes, as well as the possibility of incorporating alternative dispute resolution techniques to overcome their limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
