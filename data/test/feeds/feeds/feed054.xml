	L. Harold Levinson, who served on Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty from 1973 until his retirement in 1999, died on Wednesday, January 26, of complications from Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He was a beloved and respected member of our community, who contributed to our lives in many ways,&rdquo; said D. Don Welch, Associate Dean for Administration.</p>
<p>
	Professor Levinson earned both his bachelor&rsquo;s and law degrees from the University of Miami in 1957 and 1962, respectively, and&nbsp;earned an LL.M.&nbsp;at New York University (1964) and a J.S.D.&nbsp;at Columbia University (1974). He joined the Vanderbilt faculty in 1973 after serving on the faculty of the University of Florida College of Law from 1966-73.

	<a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=336" target="_blank">Sean B. Seymore</a>, Associate Professor of Law, has received a secondary appointment as Associate Professor of Chemistry in Vanderbilt University&rsquo;s Department of Chemistry, effective January 1. The appointment was announced by Carolyn Dever, Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Science at Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>
	Professor Seymore, whose research focuses on how patent law should advance in response to scientific advances, joined Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty in fall 2010. He holds a Ph.D. in chemistry and a J.D. from the University of Notre Dame and earned his M.S. in chemistry at the Georgia Institute of Technology and his B.S. in chemistry at the University of Tennessee, which he attended as a Tennessee Scholar. His dissertation, <em><a href="http://people.vanderbilt.edu/~sean.seymore/research.html" target="_blank">Polar Effects in Metal-Mediated Nitrogen and Oxygen Atom Transfer</a></em>, led to four peer-reviewed publications in the journal&nbsp;<em>Inorganic Chemistry</em>, including a <a href="http://people.vanderbilt.edu/~sean.seymore/inocaj_big_021102.gif" target="_blank">cover article</a>. He is currently working on a book that addresses the role of failure and unexpected results in chemical research.</p>
<p>
	Professor Seymore practiced patent law with Foley Haag in Boston and served on the law faculty at Washington &amp; Lee University before joining Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty. &ldquo;Vanderbilt has placed a major emphasis on interdisciplinary research, and I look forward to the opportunity to pursue projects that draw on my background in chemical research as well as law, &ldquo; Professor Seymore said. &ldquo;Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Department of Chemistry is already closely aligned with Vanderbilt&rsquo;s schools of Medicine and Engineering and its departments of Biological Sciences and Physics, and I&rsquo;m pleased to have the opportunity to extend the department&rsquo;s reach into the area of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Before earning his law degree, Professor Seymore held academic appointments in chemistry at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Rowan University and was a Visiting Scientist at Indiana University Bloomington. He is an active member of the American Chemical Society (ACS), and currently serves on the executive committee for the Division of Chemistry and the Law. He is also engaged with the Chemical Heritage Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to foster an understanding or chemistry&rsquo;s impact on society.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Sean Seymore is an outstanding addition to our law faculty, and I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;ll make significant contributions to Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Department of Chemistry,&rdquo; Dean Chris Guthrie said. &ldquo;His expertise in inorganic chemistry and patent law gives him a unique vantage point for both disciplines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty also includes members who hold primary or secondary appointments in the Departments of Biology, Psychiatry, Political Science, Economics, Philosophy and Religion and in the School of Medicine and the Owen Graduate School of Management in addition to their appointments at the School of Law.</p>

	2011 Martin Luther King Jr. Lecture at Vanderbilt Law School</h5>
<p>
	In the 25 years since President Ronald Reagan signed legislation making the birthday of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. a national holiday, King has become an almost mythical American hero. In the 2011 Martin Luther King Jr. Lecture at Vanderbilt Law School, Judge Roger Gregory, who saw King speak at a Virginia church as an eight-year-old, recalled King as a practical activist focused on bringing about an immediate end to segregation and the myriad injustices it institutionalized. However, Judge Gregory said, since King&rsquo;s assassination in 1963 his image has &ldquo;morphed&rdquo; from that of an outspoken preacher who calmly but firmly insisted that American society embrace radical change for the sake of justice to that of &ldquo;a more distant historical figure&rdquo; celebrated as winner of a Nobel Peace Prize and a visionary civil rights leader whose ultimate victory was assured.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/vulsplayer.asp?vid=129" target="_blank">View Judge Gregory&#39;s 2011 Martin Luther King Jr. Lecture at Vanderbilt Law School, delivered January 18</a></p>
<p>
	In his January 18 lecture, Judge Gregory, who has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit since 1999, chose to focus on the demands that King &nbsp;made in his famous &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo; speech rather than the dream King famously described in the stirring conclusion of his talk. &ldquo;The dream was the &lsquo;hook,&rsquo; if you will, in the normal tradition of the Southern Baptist preacher,&rsquo;&rdquo; Judge Gregory explained. &ldquo;The most noted speech of Dr. King&rsquo;s has taken on the great power of the dream, but Dr. King was not focused on his idea of what lies in the distance; he wanted justice now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	King emphasized his commitment to the principles that &ldquo;separate but equal is wrong, and violates the constitution&rdquo; by demanding an immediate end to segregation and insisting that the government actively enforce equal rights for all Americans. &ldquo;It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment,&rdquo; King warned. &ldquo;&hellip;Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Justice in the particular form of desegregation, Judge Gregory noted drily, would in fact take years to be realized in some areas of the country. States were ordered to desegregate their schools with &ldquo;all deliberate speed,&rdquo; but in Judge Gregory&rsquo;s home state of Virginia, public schools in Prince Edward County were closed for five years before integrating. Judge Gregory, who grew up in rural Petersburg, Virginia, and graduated summa cum laude at Virginia State University before earning his law degree at the University of Michigan, became the first member of his family to graduate from high school.</p>
<p>
	Justice also came at a price. Eighteen days after King delivered his most famous speech, four girls were killed when a bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. &ldquo;Dr. King had to go to Birmingham to tell people to stay calm, not to rise with the instinct to retaliate,&rdquo; Judge Gregory said. In a telephone conversation, President John F. Kennedy urged King to continue encouraging African Americans to resist any impulse to retaliate. &ldquo;The movement could not come down to a racial struggle,&rdquo; Judge Gregory said. &ldquo;Nobody would ever remember who started the fight, and Dr. King would lose those people of good will, white and others, who were helping. Therefore, President Kennedy told Dr. King, &lsquo;I think you&rsquo;ve got to tell the Negro that this is the hard price that they have got to pay to get the job done.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Judge Gregory also emphasized that King was a great leader, but a man whose &ldquo;feet were made of clay. &hellip;By exalting his accomplishments into a legendary tale that is annually told, we fail to recognize his humanity, his public and private struggle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dr. King dealt with the whole idea of the guilt of always being in the limelight, knowing there were always those who weren&rsquo;t in the limelight. When you make someone so mythical and distant, you fail to realize that you could go and do likewise, &hellip;that life is not a dream, that there&rsquo;s no time for slumbering, that it&rsquo;s time to be awake, be up and doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Those who remember King only as a mythical figure who achieved something great in the past may fail to recognize the need to continue working to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to realize their full potential, Judge Gregory concluded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a disservice to Dr. King, because that kind of justice is what Dr. King lived for and ultimately gave his life for.&rdquo;</p>

	<strong>Carlton B. Tarkington &rsquo;63 (BS &rsquo;59)</strong> has been named Vanderbilt Law School&rsquo;s 2011 Distinguished Alumnus, and <strong>Curtis R. Welling &rsquo;75 </strong>is the recipient of the law school&rsquo;s 2011 Distinguished Service Award.</p>
<p>
	The awards were announced by Dean Chris Guthrie, and Tarkington and Welling will be honored at the 2011 Founders Circle Dinner on April 8.</p>
<p>
	Carlton Tarkington&nbsp;retired from a successful career as an executive with West Publishing and then founded Edinburgh Investments, a broker in the investments, real estate and banking sector, in 1996. He has since founded two banks, the Bank of Bellevue and PrimeTrust Bank, which merged with Bank of the South in 2006. In 1998, Tarkington endowed the law school&rsquo;s Tarkington Chair in Teaching Excellence, a three-year appointment that recognizes members of Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty for outstanding classroom teaching and student mentoring. Professor Emeritus Tom McCoy, a constitutional law expert, was the first chair holder, followed by the late Professor Richard Nagareda, a renowned teacher who taught complex litigation. The current chair holder is Professor Michael Vandenbergh, who teaches courses in environmental and property law. Tarkington served on the law school&rsquo;s Board of Advisors (formerly known as the National Council) and supported the major expansion and renovation the law school completed in 2002 by endowing the Tarkington Suite, which includes the library&rsquo;s reading room, a computer lab and a computer room. His son, Bruce L. Tarkington &rsquo;01, earned both his J.D. and undergraduate (BS &rsquo;98) degrees at Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>
	Curt Welling is the president and chief executive officer of AmeriCares, a leading international humanitarian aid organization for delivering donated medicines and supplies. Among his many accomplishments, Welling directed AmeriCares relief efforts for several large-scale disasters, including the Myanmar cyclone, the China earthquake, the Southeast Asian tsunami, the Pakistan earthquake, and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In 2004, he launched a program that delivers medial aid to clinics serving displaced persons in Darfur, Sudan and neighboring Chad.</p>
<p>
	Before joining AmeriCares, Welling had a successful 25-year career as an executive in the investment banking and securities industry in senior executive roles, serving as president and chief executive officer of SG Cowen Securities Corporation and senior managing director of global equity capital markets at Bear Stearns. He currently serves as a director of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc., as a member of the Board of Visitors at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy at Dartmouth College, as vice chair of The Adirondack Council, and is a member of the Council of Foreign Relations. Before earning his law degree at Vanderbilt, Welling earned a B.A. and an M.B.A. at Dartmouth. In 2006, he delivered the law school&rsquo;s Victor I. Johnson Lecture, &ldquo;From Sudan to Tsunami: Reflections of a Recovering Investment Banker.&rdquo; His daughter, Katie Welling, earned her undergraduate degree (BS &rsquo;05) at Peabody College of Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Both of these men have used their legal education not only to build successful careers, but also to build institutions that enriched their communities,&rdquo; Dean Chris Guthrie said. &ldquo;After a long and successful career as a publishing executive, Carlton Tarkington became a successful entrepreneur, and he has been a stalwart supporter of the law school, contributing both his time and his resources to our advancement. Curt Welling was the guiding force behind AmeriCares&rsquo; delivery of health care supplies and resources to fulfill the health care needs of people around the world and in the United States. I&rsquo;m proud to announce that Carlton Tarkington will be honored as our 2011 Distinguished Alumnus, and that Curt Welling will receive our 2011 Distinguished Service Award.&rdquo;</p>

	The massive earthquake that devastated Haiti on January 12, 2010, not only resulted in the deaths of an estimated 230,000 people; it left another 300,000 people injured and more than a million people homeless. As governments, charitable organizations and individuals around the world responded to the crisis, Professors Tracey George and Michael Vandenbergh drew their students&rsquo; attention to the work of AmeriCares, an international disaster relief and aid organization headed by <a href="http://www.americares.org/newsroom/in-house-experts/curt-curtis-welling-humanitarian-disaster-relief-expert.html">Curtis R. Welling</a>, Class of 1975, who has served as AmeriCares&rsquo; President and CEO since 2002. &ldquo;AmeriCares provides immediate response to emergency medical needs and supports long-term humanitarian assistance programs for all people around the world,&rdquo; Professor George said. &ldquo;When we discussed with our students Curt&rsquo;s amazing work at AmeriCares, they were inspired and eager to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In mid-January, Professor George pitted the 1Ls in her Spring 2010 Contract Law course (Section B of the Class of 2012) against those in Professor Vandenbergh&rsquo;s Property course (Section A). The challenge to each 1L section: Donate the most to AmeriCares or to the American Red Cross to assist with humanitarian efforts in Haiti.&nbsp; Professor George and Dean Chris Guthrie promised to match Section B&rsquo;s donations up to $1,000; Professor Vandenbergh and his wife, Professor Linda Breggin, made the same promise to Section B. &ldquo;The students not only met the match amount, they exceeded it!&rdquo; Professor George said. Members of the two classes combined donated more than $3,000 to AmeriCares or the American Red Cross, and the professors&rsquo; match of $2000 went to AmeriCares.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Many of our students wanted to do something to support the Haitian people in the aftermath of the earthquake,&rdquo; Professor Vandenbergh said. &ldquo;This friendly competition allowed them to combine their gifts to make a bigger impact and learn more about a major relief organization that happens to be headed by a Vanderbilt Law graduate.&rdquo;</p>

	The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues released its first report focusing on the emerging field of synthetic biology December 16. <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=166" target="_blank">Nita Farahany</a>, associate professor of law and philosophy, serves on the bioethics commission.</p>
<p>
	Synthetic biology is research that combines elements of biology, engineering, genetics, chemistry, and computer science. Achievements in synthetic biology rely on artificially created DNA to create new biochemical systems or organisms with enhanced characteristics.</p>
<p>
	&quot;This report comes after a comprehensive review and three open meetings of the commission, during which we heard from experts on the science, applications, risks and benefits of the emerging field of synthetic biology,&rdquo; said Farahany. &ldquo;We have issued recommendations to President Obama that reflect the consensus views of the commission. The recommendations offer a measured approach that embraces scientific progress, but seeks to safeguard against potential risks of synthetic biology on an ongoing basis.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The commission advises President Obama on legal, philosophical and social issues arising from the biosciences and suggests policies to ensure scientific research, health care delivery and technological innovation are conducted in an ethically responsible manner.</p>
<p>
	Professor Farahany is a leading expert in the intersection between law, philosophy and the biosciences, especially related to behavioral genetics and neuroscience. She is the editor and a contributor to The Impact of Behavioral Sciences on Criminal Law, which includes essays from experts in science, law, philosophy and policy on the emerging use of behavioral genetics and neuroscience in criminal law.</p>

	<a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=151" target="_blank">James F. Blumstein</a>, University Professor of Constitutional Law and Health Law and Policy, delivered a presentation, <a href="http://www.aei.org/video/101357" target="_blank">&quot;Constitutional Challenges to Health Reform: The Expanded Medicare Mandate&quot; at a forum, &quot;Who&#39;s in Charge?&nbsp;More Legal Challenges to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,&quot;</a>&nbsp;at the American Enterprise Institute on December 6.</p>
<p>
	Professor Blumstein concludes that the&nbsp;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&nbsp;(PPACA) overreaches federal authority by imposing new conditions on state Medicaid programs. He argues that PPACA reflects a modification of the federal-state Medicaid contract and that less deference is owed to conditions imposed on federal contract modification as distinct from original contract formation--when states entered the Medicaid program initially.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Where a substantial modification of an ongoing federal spending program such as Medicaid occurs and affects a substantial portion of a state&#39;s budget, the federal government may not use its leverage to impose new conditions as a program modification,&quot; he said.</p>

	When <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/newton" target="_blank">Michael A. Newton</a>, professor of the practice of law at Vanderbilt, was asked to serve as a member of a working group on genocide prevention, several students in his International Law Practice Lab gained an opportunity to support his work with their own substantive research on what makes international networks work effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Professor Newton was among the international human rights experts asked to support the formation of specific recommendations by the Genocide Prevention Task Force, a group formed by the U.S. Institute for Peace and the Holocaust Memorial Museum and co-chaired by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and former Secretary of Defense William Cohen. &ldquo;The Genocide Prevention Task Force made a series of thoughtful and ambitious recommendations, many of which have already been operationalized,&rdquo; Professor Newton said. &ldquo;Genocide and mass atrocities undermine basic human rights and threaten regional stability, and the Task Force recommended the creation of an integrated international network designed to prevent or preempt genocide and mass atrocities rather than relying on existing response mechanisms. The 114 countries that have become States Parties to the International Criminal Court have already agreed to work together to aid member countries in holding their political and military leaders responsible for atrocities responsible for their crimes. Members of the Genocide Prevention Task Force hoped to establish an equally effective international network aimed at preventing the commission of such crimes and human rights abuses.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Professor Newton presented his paper, &ldquo;Prospects &amp; Process for Developing an Integrated Atrocity Prevention Network,&rdquo; at an International Symposium on Genocide Prevention in Paris on November 15 and 16 held by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the France&rsquo;s M&eacute;morial de la Shoah. &ldquo;The symposium was convened as a concrete step towards implementing the Genocide Prevention Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations,&rdquo; Professor Newton said. Symposium organizers also distributed to conference participants a supporting white paper, &ldquo;The Six Pillars of an Effective Network,&rdquo; written by four students in his International Law Practice Lab: <a href="http://www.law.vanderbilt.edu/academics/academic-programs/international-legal-studies/program-news/noah-coakley-12/index.aspx" target="_blank">Noah Coakley</a>, Steven Haymore, Amber Johns and Vijnata Trivedi. Johns, a second-year student who majored in French at the University of California, Berkeley, and spent a year studying in France, accompanied him to the conference and served as a rapporteur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Johns learned that Professor Newton was preparing a paper to present at the International Symposium on Genocide Prevention while participating in Vanderbilt in Venice, the law school&rsquo;s summer study abroad program, which Professor Newton directs. As soon as she discovered that Newton was planning to assign students in his International Practice Lab the task of writing a white paper for the conference, &ldquo;I asked Professor Newton to let me work on this paper and attend the symposium,&rdquo; Johns said. &ldquo;I knew it would be an incredible learning experience.&rdquo; In addition to Newton, speakers included Stephen Rapp, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes; human rights diplomats from France, Germany, Hungary and Switzerland, and representatives of many major international organizations and U.N. agencies. &ldquo;Watching Ambassador Rapp sit down with other diplomats and human rights advocates and talk about how they can work together to prevent future genocide and what they can learn from things that have happened in the past was really rewarding,&rdquo; Johns said.<br />
	<br />
	The students&rsquo; white paper reflected months of research, during which the four studied more than 70 international organizations and networks to identify common traits that enabled the networks to work effectively. &ldquo;Our task was to identify the best practices that make international networks effective,&rdquo; 2L Noah Coakley said. &ldquo;I had spent last summer in Belgium and Uganda working for No Peace Without Justice, which is a non-profit advocacy organization that helps countries deal with the aftermath of atrocities, and I really appreciated the opportunity to do research on genocide prevention in Professor Newton&rsquo;s Practice Lab.&rdquo;<br />

	It has been long suspected that Mexican immigrants often work on dangerous and unpleasant jobs for low pay. New research by Vanderbilt University Law School professors <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=173" target="_blank">Joni Hersch </a>and<a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=196" target="_blank"> W. Kip Viscusi </a>provides hard evidence on the risks and rewards for risky jobs. They find that Mexican immigrants are concentrated in jobs with high risk of fatality, but they receive little wage compensation for these risks.</p>
<p>
	In their study, &quot;Immigrant Status and the Value of Statistical Life,&quot; Hersch and Viscusi, who co-direct Vanderbilt&#39;s <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/phd-in-law--economics/index.aspx" target="">Law and Economics Program</a>, found that Mexican immigrants are in jobs with fatality rates more than one-third higher than other workers, but they do not receive higher pay for these risks. In contrast, other immigrant groups are similar to native U.S. workers in both their job risk levels and wage compensation for risk. The study has been published in the <em>Journal of Human Resources</em>.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://ssrn.com/abstract_id=1394360" target="_blank">Read the abstract</a>.</p>
<p>
	Hersch and Viscusi used U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from the Current Population Survey, which has a large sample size, and the New Immigrant Survey, which provides more detail about the characteristics of immigrants than other data sets.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Non-Mexican immigrants as a group are similar to native U.S. workers in terms of the average job risks they face and their compensation for those risks,&rdquo; said Viscusi, University Distinguished Professor of Law, Economics and Management. &ldquo;But Mexican immigrants are the outliers, especially when it comes to fatal injuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Hersch and Viscusi find that the evidence is consistent with the theory that Mexican immigrants face different labor market conditions than do native U.S. workers and even other immigrants who are not Mexican.</p>

	Vanderbilt Law School&rsquo;s National Council voted to change its name to the Board of Advisors, a name which better reflects the board&rsquo;s role in supporting the law school, at its meeting on Friday, October 22.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The alumni who serve on the board offer invaluable guidance to me and to our administrative team about all aspects of our operation,&rdquo; said Dean Chris Guthrie. &ldquo;The Board of Advisors&rsquo; new name reflects its increasingly important role in providing advice and offering a real-world perspective as we make decisions about the law school&rsquo;s future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In the aftermath of the financial crisis that began in fall 2008, members of Vanderbilt Law School&rsquo;s National Council advised Dean Guthrie and the law school&rsquo;s administrative staff as the law school identified priorities in the face of tighter budgets and supported the launch of multiple initiatives.</p>
<p>
	Doug Dunn, Class of 1970, who recently retired as a partner in Milbank Tweed in New York, is currently president of the Board of Advisors. &ldquo;The board plays a crucial role on a number of levels: offering guidance to help the law school carry out its mission of providing an excellent and relevant legal education, attracting talented and capable students, and mentoring students and recent graduates,&rdquo; Dunn said. &ldquo;During my term as president, I&rsquo;ve learned a tremendous amount about the effort it takes to provide the level of legal education Vanderbilt students receive. I think the alumni on the Board appreciate the opportunity to apply their experience to improve the current student preparation. &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Board of Advisors meets at the law school twice each year and serves the school in other ways throughout the year. Board members serve three-year terms, and a member of the most recent graduating class joins the law school&#39;s board each year for a one-year term. The board includes three standing committees: an executive committee, a nominating committee, and a finance committee. Pat Mulloy, Class of 1977, is currently president-elect of the board, and his term as president will begin in fall 2011.<br />

	James F. Neal, Class of 1957, died on October 21, 2010. He was 81.</p>
<p>
	Neal spent much of his career as a high-profile trial lawyer with Neal &amp; Harwell, the firm he cofounded in 1971 with Aubrey B. Harwell Jr., Class of 1967.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/23/us/23neal.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=James%20Neal&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">Read an October 23 New York Times story about Jim Neal&rsquo;s distinguished career by Bruce Weber</a></p>
<p>
	Neal, who had been recognized as one of the county&rsquo;s top trial lawyers for more than four decades, was profiled in a 2009 <em>American Bar Association Journal </em>article on <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/james_neal" target="_blank">&ldquo;Lions of the Trial Bar,&rdquo;</a> a piece which also featured another Vanderbilt Law graduate, Bobby Lee Cook, Class of 1949. Neal told<em> ABA Journal </em>writer Mark Curriden that he had learned one of the keys to his success while playing football at the University of Wyoming as an undergraduate. &ldquo;The coach used to say, &lsquo;The team with the fewest mistakes during the game will win,&rsquo;&rdquo; Neal said. &ldquo;It was true in football and it is true in the courtroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Neal gained national attention early in his legal career, when he served as a special assistant to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. In 1961, he began investigations that ultimately led to the prosecution of labor leader James Hoffa over alleged corruption in the Teamsters Union. After that prosecution ended in a mistrial, Neal successfully prosecuted Hoffa for jury tampering two years later.</p>
<p>
	In 1964, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Neal as U.S. Attorney for Middle Tennessee, and he served until 1966, when he entered private practice. Although he took leaves of absence to serve as Chief Trial Counsel of the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in 1973-74 and as Chief Counsel of the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Undercover Operations of the Department of Justice in 1982, he was a partner in Neal and Harwell for the remainder of his legal career.</p>
<p>
	Neal found himself in the national spotlight when he defended Elvis Presley&rsquo;s physician, George Nichopoulos, Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards, the Ford Motor Company in the criminal trial related to the design of Ford&rsquo;s Pinto model, director John Landis in a California homicide trial after three actors were killed in a helicopter accident on the &ldquo;Twilight Zone&rdquo; movie set, and Exxon Corporation in charges resulting from the Exxon Valdez Alaskan oil spill. Neal also served as private counsel for Vice President Albert Gore Jr. in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>
	Neal was a lecturer in law at Vanderbilt Law School from 1966 to 1979, with leaves of absence in 1973 and 1974 while he served on the Watergate prosecution team.</p>
<p>
	A native of Sumner County, Tennessee, Neal attended the University of Wyoming on a football scholarship, graduating in 1952. He was an active duty member of the United States Marine Corps from 1952 to 1954, ultimately retiring from the Reserves as a Major. At Vanderbilt Law School, he was editor-in-chief of the <em>Vanderbilt Law Review </em>and recipient of the Founders Medal, presented to the student who maintained the highest grade point average throughout law school. He also earned a master of laws degree in taxation from Georgetown University Law Center.</p>
<p>
	Neal was recognized on numerous &ldquo;best lawyers&rdquo; listings and as a Distinguished Alumnus of both Vanderbilt Law School and the University of Wyoming. He was a member of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, the American College of Trial Lawyers, the Association of Former United States Attorneys, the American Bar Association and the Tennessee Bar Association and a fellow of the Nashville Bar Association. He served as vice chair of the Nashville Chapter of the Urban League and of the Nashville Human Relations Commission, and on the Executive Committee of the Nashville Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>
	He is survived by his wife, Dianne Ferrell Neal, Class of 1983, a lawyer who served as legal counsel to Tennessee Governor Ned McWherter; his son, James F. Neal Jr.; his daughter, Julie Neal; his stepdaughter, Sarah Cooper Nickoloff, and five grandchildren, and by two sisters.</p>

	Richard Nagareda, the David Daniels Allen Professor of Law and director of the Cecil D. Branstetter Litigation and Dispute Resolution Program, died at his home on Friday, October 8. He was 47.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/vulsplayer.asp?vid=128" target="_blank">View video of the memorial held at the law school on Friday, November 12, 2010 </a></p>
<p>
	Nagareda&rsquo;s appointment to the David Daniels Allen Chair in Law had been announced just two weeks before his death by Dean Chris Guthrie. &ldquo;Richard was a personal friend as well as an esteemed colleague, and those of us who were fortunate enough to know him and work with him are devastated,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said. &ldquo;The legal academy has lost a gifted scholar, our students an extremely talented teacher, and his wife, son and mother have lost a beloved husband, father and son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Nagareda was a leading civil litigation scholar whose work focused on class actions and aggregate litigation. He was the author of a definitive work on complex litigation theory, <em>Mass Torts in a World of Settlement</em> (University of Chicago Press, 2008), as well as a casebook, <em>The Law of Class Actions and Other Aggregate Litigation</em>, released by Foundation Press in 2010. He served as an Associate Reporter on the American Law Institute&rsquo;s <em>Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation</em>, released in summer 2010, and took the primary drafting role for the chapter addressing class certification. He had directed the law school&rsquo;s Cecil D. Branstetter Litigation &amp; Dispute Resolution Program since its founding in 2005.</p>
<p>
	In addition to being a respected scholar, Nagareda was an esteemed teacher who held the three-year Tarkington Chair for Teaching Excellence from 2006-09 and was recognized three times by his students with the Hall-Hartman Award for Teaching Excellence, most recently in 2010. He taught Administrative Law, Complex Litigation, Evidence, and multiple seminars, including an innovative Civil Litigation Capstone Seminar he developed for third-year students. &ldquo;Richard was a gifted teacher and mentor,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said. &ldquo;Regardless of the subject matter, he received outstanding teaching evaluations from his students, many of whom remained in touch with him after graduating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	His influential articles were published in the <em>University of Chicago Law Review</em>, the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>, the <em>Cornell Law Review</em>, the <em>Georgetown Law Journal</em>, the<em> Harvard Law Review</em>, the <em>Michigan Law Review</em>, the <em>New York University Law Review</em>, the <em>Texas Law Review</em>, the <em>UCLA Law Review</em> and the <em>University of Pennsylvania Law Review</em>, among others.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Richard was among the most influential and widely cited legal scholars in his field in the country,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said. &ldquo;He published a rich body of scholarship on aggregate litigation, in which he drew from legal doctrine, economics, psychology, and the on-the-ground realities of litigation and litigation financing to offer a pragmatic and nuanced account of the resolution of mass disputes that carefully balances both private and public law considerations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Nagareda earned his undergraduate degree from Stanford University in 1985 and his J.D. from the University of Chicago in 1988. He then served as a clerk for Judge Douglas Ginsburg on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. He practiced law in the Office of Legal Counsel for two years and then joined the law firm of Shea &amp; Gardner, where he practiced for three years. In 1994, Nagareda joined the faculty at the University of Georgia School of Law, where he taught for seven years before joining Vanderbilt&rsquo;s faculty in 2001. He was a Visiting Professor at New York University, the University of Texas, and Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>
	Since joining Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty, Nagareda had chaired the law school&rsquo;s Entry Level Faculty Appointments Committee and an Ad Hoc Tenure Committee and had served on multiple committees at the law school and university. &ldquo;Richard leaves behind an exceptional record of scholarship, teaching and service, coupled with his national reputation as a leading light in his field,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said.</p>
<p>
	Students and colleagues benefited from Nagareda&rsquo;s sense of humor and his deep appreciation and enjoyment of pop culture, of which he had an encyclopedic knowledge. He was a fan of &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deadwood&rdquo; as well as an avid movie buff. A devoted sports fan, he was a lifelong supporter of the New York Yankees, the San Francisco Giants, and the San Francisco 49ers. Knowing his students mimicked his distinctive speaking style, he awarded a prize each year to the student whose impression of him was judged best.</p>
<p>
	Nagareda regularly contributed to the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and other respected news outlets for his expertise on class action lawsuits and product liability cases.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The entire Vanderbilt community is deeply saddened by the loss of Richard Nagareda. He was an exemplary scholar and brought an unparalleled level of expertise to the law school,&rdquo; said Vanderbilt University Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos. &ldquo;Richard had an amazingly clear way of explaining complex lawsuits to others and was readily available to add his perspective to the public discourse on important topics. It was an honor to have him represent Vanderbilt in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Nagareda is survived by his wife, his son, and his mother.</p>
<p>
	His family has asked that memorials be directed to the law school for the purpose of establishing a scholarship in Professor Nagareda&rsquo;s honor&nbsp;or to the Ensworth School in Nashville, Tennessee.<br />

<p>
	&ldquo;Our goal was to provide benchmark information for the city&rsquo;s leaders so that they can develop a strategic blueprint in terms of sports for Nashville going forward,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;This was a great opportunity for Vanderbilt law students to work on an applied research project that connects directly to their coursework and is useful to the city that Vanderbilt is proud to call home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The first part of the report strives to convey the &ldquo;landscape&rdquo; of Nashville as a sports city with its listing of teams and events held during the past decade. There is a complete inventory of all of the athletic facilities owned by the city and area universities, colleges and high schools. In addition, the organizations and governing bodies that manage and promote sports are described.</p>
<p>
	The second part of the study takes an in-depth look at cities that are comparable or similarly situated to Nashville to see how they are utilizing sports in their communities. The cities that are considered Nashville&rsquo;s peers for the study&rsquo;s purposes are Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Tampa and Memphis.</p>
<p>
	The study&rsquo;s conclusion has observations and determinations about Nashville&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses for expanding its sports presence with respect to the other cities in the report.</p>
<p>
	Strengths for Nashville identified in the report include its recognizable branding as Music City, a pedestrian-friendly downtown, a strong volunteer base and its convenient geographic location for a large portion of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>
	In addition, the study praises the Nashville Sports Council as having a very positive national reputation and notes a community synergy among various groups working to ensure &ldquo;an optimal event experience&rdquo; concerning sports.</p>
<p>
	Nashville&rsquo;s primary weakness is not enough revenue sources, especially public/private funding mechanisms, according to the report. One of the peer cities cited as having strong cooperation between the government and private sector on sports initiatives is Indianapolis. For example, the Capital Improvement Board of Marion County manages the home of the Indianapolis Colts, Lucas Field, among several high-profile athletic facilities. According to the study, the board specifically highlights the importance of private sector cooperation through its operating model.</p>
<p>
	Another city with multiple and interrelated entities in sports is St. Louis, The St. Louis Sports Commission, an independent, privately funded nonprofit organization, is responsible for attracting, creating and managing major sports events for that region. Meanwhile, the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority is a governmental body that owns the Edward Jones Dome, home of the St. Louis Rams. While the authority owns the dome, the St. Louis Convention and Visitors Commission, another private organization, manages the day-to-day operation of the facility.</p>
<p>
	All of the cities that were compared to Nashville have &ldquo;a solid public/private partnership dedicated to supporting and sustaining sports within that community,&rdquo; according to the study. However, the form of the partnership can vary widely. &ldquo;Simply put, there is not one &lsquo;successful&rsquo; model. As such, Nashville leaders have the ability to devise a plan and structure that works best for Nashville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The State of Sports in Nashville&rdquo; is one of many research projects that the Vanderbilt Center for Nashville Studies is overseeing on community-identified issues and needs, according to Whitney Weeks, executive director. &ldquo;The center is at the intersection of Nashville&rsquo;s need for policy-level data and information and Vanderbilt&rsquo;s desire to apply its research expertise to issues of importance to the city.&quot;</p>

	Blair&rsquo;s work focuses on corporate law and financial markets.</h4>
<p>
	Margaret Mendenhall Blair, an internationally known economist who studies corporate and finance law,&nbsp;has been appointed to the Milton R. Underwood Chair in Free Enterprise at Vanderbilt Law School.</p>
<p>
	Her appointment was announced by Vanderbilt Law Dean Chris Guthrie.</p>
<p>
	Professor Blair&rsquo;s current research focuses on&nbsp;four areas: team production and the legal structure of business organizations,&nbsp;legal issues in the governance of supply chains, the role of private-sector governance arrangements in contract enforcement, and&nbsp;the problem of excessive leverage in financial markets.&nbsp;Since joining the academy, she has received four grants from the Alfred E. Sloan Foundation to support her research, one of which is funding her current research on private-sector governance and excess leverage in financial markets.</p>
<p>
	Over the course of her academic career, Professor Blair has written or edited 12 books or monographs and nearly 30 journal articles. Her books and monographs include seven published by Brookings and four published by the Georgetown University Press.&nbsp;Perhaps the best known is <em>Ownership and Control: Rethinking Corporate Governance for the Twenty-first Century, </em>published in 1995, which received an academic book publisher award, and was translated into Chinese and republished by the Chinese Social Science Publishing House.&nbsp;Her articles have been published in law reviews, peer-reviewed journals, and professional publications, including the <em>University of Pennsylvania Law Review</em>, the <em>UCLA Law Review</em> and the <em>University of Virginia Law Review</em>.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Margaret Blair&rsquo;s corporate law scholarship is widely-read, well regarded and frequently cited by other scholars,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said. &ldquo;Throughout her academic career, she has demonstrated a journalist&rsquo;s nose for important questions, and she has mounted a well-known challenge to the dominant account of corporate law.&nbsp;Rather than focusing narrowly on shareholder value, Professor Blair has argued that corporate law should take account of a much broader array of &lsquo;stakeholders,&rsquo; including employees.&nbsp;She has also raised provocative questions about supply chain management, including assurance services and outsourcing, as well as the causes and cures of economic crises like the so-called &lsquo;great recession.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Professor Blair&rsquo;s most recent work includes a new working paper, &ldquo;Financial Innovation, Leverage, Bubbles, and the Distribution of Income,&rdquo; accepted for publication in the <em>Journal of Banking and Financial Law</em>;&nbsp;a&nbsp;chapter, &ldquo;An Economic Perspective on the Notion of Human Capital,&rdquo; in the <em>Oxford University Handbook of Human Capital</em>; and a chapter, coauthored with Cynthia A. Williams and Li-Wen Lin, in the forthcoming <em>Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Governance, The Contribution of Economic Theory and Related Disciplines</em> (Palgrave McMillan), of which she is also co-editor with Lorenzo Sacconi, Edward Freeman and Alessandro Vercelli, entitled &ldquo;The Roles of Standardization, Certification and Assurance Services in Global Commerce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Professor Blair joined&nbsp;Vanderbilt&#39;s law&nbsp;faculty in 2004 as part of the team supporting the <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/academics/academic-programs/law--business-program/index.aspx" target="_blank">Law and Business Program</a>, where she teaches Corporations, Corporate Finance and advanced seminars such as Theory of the Firm.&nbsp;Before joining Vanderbilt&#39;s faculty, Professor Blair taught at&nbsp;Georgetown University Law Center, where she became a visiting professor in 1996 and was a Sloan Visiting Professor, teaching Corporations and Corporate Finance, and the Research Director for the Sloan-GULC Project on Business Institutions, from 2000 through June 2004. Blair has also been a Senior Fellow in the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution, where she wrote about corporate governance and the role of human capital in corporations. She served on the board of directors of Sonic Corp. from 2001 through 2006 and currently serves on the board of WRAP (Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production).</p>
<p>
	Professor Blair earned three graduate degrees, a Ph.D., an M.Phil. and an M.A. in economics, at Yale University. She earned her undergraduate degree in journalism from the University of Oklahoma and then served as a bureau chief and correspondent for <em>Business Week</em> magazine before beginning her graduate work at Yale. She began her career as a reporter for the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Professor Blair has devoted substantial time to professional service, sitting on multiple boards and refereeing for multiple journals,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said. &ldquo;At Vanderbilt, she has served as a member of the University Faculty Senate, chaired an ad hoc renewal and promotion committee, and served as a member of the Faculty Appointments Committee.&nbsp;The law school has benefitted greatly from her teaching, scholarship and service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The Milton R. Underwood Chair in Free Enterprise was endowed by the Fondren Foundation to honor Milton Underwood, Class of 1928. The chair was previously held by James W. Ely, a distinguished legal historian and property rights expert, who retired from Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty in 2009. The Underwood endowment supports two faculty chairs; Chris Slobogin, who heads Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Criminal Justice Program, holds the Milton R. Underwood Chair in Law.</p>

http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=346</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=346</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Frederick T. Work, who became one of the first African Americans to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School, has died at age 75. Work spent his entire 50-year legal career in Gary, Indiana, where he&nbsp;established a law practice&nbsp;after earning his law degree at Vanderbilt in 1959.</p>
<p>Work earned his undergraduate degree at Fisk University in Nashville, where both of his parents were professors. He had been accepted at Boston University School of Law and was planning to earn his law degree there when Dean John Wade invited him to interview for admission to Vanderbilt Law School in spring 1956. At the interview, he learned that Edward Melvin Porter, the president of the student body at Tennessee State University, had also been invited to apply. &ldquo;We were casual acquaintances,&rdquo; Work recalled in a 2007 talk he and Porter delivered to&nbsp;an audience of Vanderbilt law students and faculty, &ldquo;but after we were both admitted, it didn&rsquo;t take us long to realize that we were going to have to become the best of friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As his graduation date approached in spring 1959, Work faced another hurdle: finding a job. &ldquo;The firms that traditionally recruited at Vanderbilt weren't interested in my services,&rdquo; Work said. Dean Wade contacted Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauvor, who secured Work an offer of employment in Washington and the offer of a fellowship at Yale.</p>
<p>Work declined both offers. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to work for the government, and I was burned out on school,&rdquo; he later admitted. He had also found his own alternative, choosing to move his family to the growing steel town of Gary, Indiana,&nbsp;where, according to his research, &ldquo;everybody was first-generation&quot; and where a fast-growing black community afforded him the opportunity to establish a legal practice.</p>
<p>Work became a respected and influential member of Gary&rsquo;s large African American community, serving for two terms as a city judge in the 1970s, when he also became the first African American to run for statewide office. But he enjoyed private practice, from which he never retired. He was known for representing high-profile criminal defendants;&nbsp;at the time of his death, Work was due in court the following Monday as defense counsel for East Chicago Mayor George Pabey. Over the course of his career, Work also served as state counsel for the NAACP and other public advocacy groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During his 50-year legal career defending causes&nbsp;and criminals that weren't always popular, Work exhibited his firm belief in the justice system,&rdquo; his obituary stated. &ldquo;Clients, judges and prosecutors alike could always expect Work to provide a vigorous defense for even the smallest infraction. And from opening gavel to verdict, he performed professionally as the gentleman he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Beverly, whom he met as a classmate at Fisk, and their sons, Frederick Jr. and Kevin.<br />

<p>She&nbsp;will be sworn in and take her seat on the&nbsp;Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on&nbsp;November 8.</p>
<p>Stranch is currently a managing member at Branstetter Stranch &amp; Jennings in Nashville. Over the course of her 30-year career, she has developed a national practice in labor and employment law, specializing in complex ERISA litigation.</p>
<p>She&nbsp;was nominated for the seat by President&nbsp;Barack Obama&nbsp;in August 2009. In announcing her nomination, the White House cited Stranch&rsquo;s deep understanding of ERISA, one of the most complex and rapidly changing areas of federal law.</p>
<p>Stranch went before the Senate Judiciary Committee in October 2009, and her nomination to the Sixth Circuit Court was approved by that committee in November. Tennessee Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker supported Stranch throughout the confirmation&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Stranch will join two other Tennesseans, both from Memphis, who serve as active judges, as well as Judge Gilbert S. Merritt Jr., Class of 1960,&nbsp;and Judge Daughtrey, both of whom have assumed senior status.</p>
<p>Stranch has practiced at Branstetter, Stranch &amp; Jennings &ndash; a firm founded by her father, Cecil D. Branstetter Sr., Class of 1949, in 1952 &ndash; throughout her legal career. A Nashville native, she is a frequent speaker at seminars and special events. She has taught labor law at Belmont University and has served on the AFL-CIO Lawyers Coordinating Committee.</p>
<p>She&nbsp;is a&nbsp;summa cum laude graduate of Vanderbilt University and was elected to the Order of the Coif after earning her J.D. at Vanderbilt Law School. She is a member of the Nashville, Tennessee and American Bar Associations, the Lawyers&rsquo; Association for Women, and a Fellow of the Nashville and Tennessee Bar Foundation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We awarded more summer stipends than ever before,&rdquo; said Sue Kay, Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, who directs Vanderbilt&rsquo;s externship and summer stipend programs. &ldquo;To apply for a stipend award, students have to secure an internship at a qualifying organization, and Vanderbilt students garnered excellent placements working in a variety of different settings. The rich experiences they gain from internships in a variety of courts, law offices, government agencies and advocacy organizations will add a valuable perspective to their legal studies when they return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Internships are an excellent way for students to gain real-world experience,&quot; said Dean Chris Guthrie. &quot;The Legal Aid Society provides a valuable benefit to students and the organizations they serve by funding many of these stipends, and the law school has increased the number of stipends we fund because of the tremendous benefit our students and the organizations they serve gain from their work.&rdquo;</p>

http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=339</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=339</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Vanderbilt University professor <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=176">Owen Jones</a>, one of the nation&rsquo;s few professors of both law and biology, has been named director of the national <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lawneuro.org">Law and Neuroscience Project</a>, which will now be headquartered at Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p>The project is an interdisciplinary network examining the impact of modern neuroscience on criminal law. It launched in 2007 and, is supported by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macfound.org">John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation</a>, which has also awarded the University a $700,000 grant to explore and develop potential topics for a second phase of this important research.</p>
<p>Jones was&nbsp;one of the original co-directors when the project launched. As the project's director, he said he plans to build on some of the most exciting and important developments of Phase I and to gather a group of leading researchers to identify and explore some of the essential work to be done at the increasingly important intersection of neuroscience and criminal law.</p>
<p>The first phase of the project, which was funded by a $10 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation, involved a broad interdisciplinary collaboration among faculty at Vanderbilt and more than two dozen other&nbsp;leading universities. Through both experimental and theoretical work, researchers investigated the potential implications of neuroscience for criminal responsibility, prediction, treatment, courtroom evidence, and understanding juror and judicial decision making.</p>
<p>Jones believes researchers in this new field have a continuing mission, given the pace of technological advances. &ldquo;One primary goal is to help the legal system sensibly assess and evaluate the new brain science it increasingly encounters, in ways that can contribute to the fair and effective administration of criminal justice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Beyond that, we&rsquo;re exploring how new techniques may enhance diagnostic, prediction and treatment tools.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jones and a team of fellow Vanderbilt&nbsp;researchers have been studying the brain&rsquo;s activities using a highly sensitive technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, which detects regions of the brain that are either&nbsp;more or less active when a person does a specific task. For example, Jones and Vanderbilt associate professor of psychology Ren&eacute; Marois conducted the first full-scale brain study of punishment decisions, ultimately discovering the brain activity that underlies a person's decision&nbsp;whether to punish&nbsp;another person,&nbsp;and, if so, how much.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt is one of the few universities in the world with a state-of-the-art <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vuiis.vanderbilt.edu/">Institute of Imaging Science</a>, lead by University Professor of Radiology and Radiological Sciences and Medical School Director <a target="_blank" href="https://medschool.mc.vanderbilt.edu/vuiis/show_faculty.php?id3=9161">John Gore</a>, which is equipped with&nbsp;high-powered fMRI brain scanners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanderbilt provides a terrific headquarters for this Law and Neuroscience Project,&rdquo; said Vanderbilt University Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos. &ldquo;While many universities are strong in law or in neuroscience, Vanderbilt has built top-notch faculties and facilities in both.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.macfound.org">The MacArthur Foundation</a> supports creative people and effective institutions committed to building a more just, verdant, and peaceful world. In addition to selecting the MacArthur Fellows, the Foundation works to defend human rights, advance global conservation and security, make cities better places, and understand how technology is affecting children and society.

Vanderbilt law students are serving internships with the Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals, with U.S. District Courts in the District of Columbia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Tennessee&nbsp;and Texas; with U.S. Attorneys offices in Alaska, California, Georgia, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia; in state and city attorneys' offices; with the U.S. Navy JAG Corps, and in a variety of agency, corporate, non-profit and other settings.</p>
<p>&quot;Externships offer an excellent opportunity for students to contextualize the doctrine and procedure that they have learned in law school,&rdquo; said <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=177">Sue Kay</a>, Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, who directs Vanderbilt&rsquo;s <a href="retCmsId=1919">externship program</a>. &ldquo;Students return with a better understanding of the way the legal system works and the type of work they want to do. In addition, they enhance each others' education by bringing their new perspectives to bear in the classroom. &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Externships, which require supervision from both a faculty member and a practitioner, offer students incomparable exposure to the practice of law as well as meaningful mentoring from both faculty and practicing lawyers and judges,&quot; said Dean Chris Guthrie. &quot;I am grateful to Associate Dean Kay for her leadership, to the faculty members who are serving as supervisors, and to&nbsp;the many practicing lawyers and sitting judges who have taken our students under their wings.&rdquo;</p>

http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=332</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=332</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Vanderbilt Law students have completed more than 12,620 hours of pro bono and community service thus far through the law school&rsquo;s Pro Bono Pledge Program, according to Renee Erickson, Class of 2010, who directed the program during its first year.</p>
<p>Students who sign the Pro Bono Pledge promise to perform a designated number of pro bono hours before they graduate. The program was initiated after 2008-09 Vanderbilt Bar Association President Charlie Gearing and Legal Aid Society President Georgia Sims formed a brainstorming group that included representatives from a number of student organizations to discuss ways to promote opportunities for public interest work.</p>
<p>At the program&rsquo;s first awards ceremony in May, Erickson congratulated 34 students, including 23 3Ls and 11 2Ls, who completed Pro Bono Pledges during the 2009-10 academic year. Three students were honored for serving the most hours in their classes: Katherine Brown, Class of 2010; Elizabeth Dellner, Class of 2011; and Jack Arnold, Class of 2012.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pro Bono Pledge Program was one of the proposals that came out of that session, and we chose to implement it immediately because we wanted to recognize Vanderbilt students for the public service they perform,&rdquo; Erickson said. &ldquo;Our student body has always been very active in the community through both legal and other community service. We felt that the Pledge was an excellent way to continue and encourage the longstanding tradition of public service here at Vanderbilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the program&rsquo;s official inception in fall 2009, 121 students signed the pledge, which requires a total commitment of 75 hours of unpaid pro bono and community service from entering 1Ls during their three years at Vanderbilt. At least 10 hours of their pro bono legal service each year must be performed in Nashville. Transfer students may also pledge to perform 50 hours of service during the time they spend studying law at Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The introduction of the Pro Bono Pledge this year was a momentous occasion for Vanderbilt Law School,&rdquo; Erickson said. &ldquo;With the introduction of the Pro Bono Pledge, Vanderbilt has reaffirmed its place as a premier legal institution alongside other top law schools. The students who completed their pledges this year contributed significantly to the law school, Nashville and other communities where they served and I was very proud to recognize their devotion and enthusiasm at the end of this academic year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To reach their pledge totals, 2Ls and 3Ls who began participating in the program in fall 2009 were allowed to report hours of service they had recorded and completed during their first and second years of law school.</p>
<p>The Pro Bono Pledge Program will be directed by Jenna Farleigh, Class of 2011,&nbsp;during 2010-11.</p>

<br />
&ldquo;For the first time in decades, pawnshops are growing in popularity in the U.S.,&rdquo; Skiba said. &ldquo;They have always been prevalent in England, going back 1,000 years. Today, you can pawn anything from a CD or DVD for a $2 loan to electronics, jewelry, dentures and prosthetic limbs. As a result, people often pawn small things just to get enough gas to get to work for the day. The typical pawn loan is small, about $50. I&rsquo;m looking at how people trade off using pawnshops versus other kinds of credit. It turns out that pawnshops are actually less expensive than many other forms of credit available to the typical customer, like payday loans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Skiba, who studies the ways in which self-control and procrastination affect financial decision making, has published a number of articles focusing on the causes and consequences of borrowing on high-interest credit, such as payday loans and pawnshops, as well as the regulation of these industries.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Professor Skiba earned her Ph.D. at&nbsp; the University of California-Berkeley. She&nbsp;has been the recipient of numerous research grants and fellowships from institutions such as National Institute on Aging, the National Science Foundation, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance and the Horowitz Foundation for Social Policy. She was a senior research associate of the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis from 1999 to 2001, where she conducted research on monetary policy and regional and urban economics.

<p>At the Commission's first meeting, held July 8-9 in Washington, D.C., members discussed synthetic biology, which involves creating biological materials entirely from synthetic ones. Commission members include scholars, government scientists and bioethicists.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/227804">View a portion of the proceedings</a></p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the White House, the Bioethics Commission's role is to advise President Obama on legal, philosophical and social issues arising from developments in the biosciences and propose policies to ensure scientific research, health care delivery, and technological innovation are conducted in an ethically responsible manner. &ldquo;As our nation invests in science and innovation and pursues advances in biomedical research and health care, it&rsquo;s imperative that we do so in a responsible manner,&quot; President Obama said.</p>
<p>Professor Farahany is a leading expert on the intersection of law and science whose recent work examines the impact of developments related to behavioral genetics and neuroscience on philosophical and practical approaches to criminal and constitutional law. In her current research, she examines how emerging research in the biosciences informs agency and responsibility theory, and challenges existing doctrines in constitutional law. Her edited collection, <em>The Impact of Behavioral Sciences on Criminal Law</em> (Oxford University Press, 2009), is a compendium of interdisciplinary essays, including her chapter on &quot;Genetics, Neuroscience, and Criminal Responsibility.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Advances in science and technology hold great promise for deepening our understanding of the natural world, and for improving institutions dedicated to health, law and national security,&quot; Professor Farahany said. &quot;But such developments also present new challenges to cherished American ideals and constitutional doctrines. I am honored by President Obama's intent to appoint me to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethics, and for the opportunity to help inform the ethical, legal and policy debates concerning scientific progress.&quot;</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/authors/nitafarahany">[Hear Professor Farahany discuss The Impact of Behavioral Sciences on Criminal Law]</a></p>
<p>Professor Farahany graduated from Dartmouth College with a degree in genetics, cell and developmental biology, and from Harvard University with a master's degree in biology. She earned her J.D., M.A., and Ph.D. in Philosophy of Biology and Jurisprudence at Duke University. Before joining Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty, Professor Farahany clerked for the Honorable Judith W. Rogers on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. She has presented her work on bioethics, neuroethics, criminal law, and behavioral health law and policy to wide-ranging audiences, including the Second Circuit Judicial Conference, the National Judicial College, the Stanford Center for the Integration of Research on Genetics and Ethics, the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the American Society for Political and Legal Philosophy. She is a member of the New York Bar, the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, and the Society for Neuroethics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an incredible honor for Nita, the Law School, and Vanderbilt University,&rdquo; said Chris Guthrie, Dean of Vanderbilt Law School. &ldquo;I commend the White House for appointing Nita to this commission. She has significant expertise in at least three disciplines relevant to the questions this body will be called upon to address and possesses judgment beyond her years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to Professor Farahany, other Commission members include:</p>

<p>Charlene Cho will be working with the Food and&nbsp;Drug Administration, Christina England with the Department of Energy, Renee Gewercman with the Department of Homeland Security, and Greg Pugh with the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>The Presidential Management Fellowship Program is designed to attract outstanding graduates representing a variety of academic disciplines and career paths, including law, who are interested in the leadership and management of public policies and programs. The two-year program, which has been in place since 1977, includes formal classroom training, a four- to six-month developmental assignment, and optional rotations of one to six months in various agency departments. In addition to challenging work assignments, Fellows have a unique opportunity to develop a professional network with other future leaders.</p>
<p>Finalists have an opportunity to apply for Fellowship positions at various federal agencies. Six of Vanderbilt&rsquo;s finalists were ultimately offered positions, and four accepted. &ldquo;The Presidential Management Fellowship program is very prestigious, and the fact that eight members of the Class of 2010 were selected as finalists this year makes a strong statement about the quality of Vanderbilt Law Graduates,&rdquo; said Lisa Doster, who works with Vanderbilt Law students interested in policy making careers with federal agencies. &ldquo;Designation as a finalist is an honor, and this is the largest number of Vanderbilt Law graduates selected to date. While some finalists inevitably end up taking positions with firms or pursuing clerkships, their selection as a finalist allows them to explore the range of career opportunities available with various federal agencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once Presidential Management Fellows successfully complete the program, they are eligible for non-competitive appointments to career federal employment.</p>
<p>&quot;This reflects well on the eight graduates who were finalists in this program, and on the support they received from our Career Services staff,&quot; said Dean Chris Guthrie. &quot;I'm extremely pleased that four of our 2010 graduates were able to accept positions as Presidential Management Fellows.&quot;</p>

http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=330</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=330</link><description><![CDATA[<p>The American Law Institute (ALI), an independent organization that produces scholarly work to clarify, modernize and improve American law, has released a new book,<em> Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation</em>. Vanderbilt law professor Richard Nagareda served as an Associate Reporter for the project, teaming up with New York University law professor Samuel Issacharoff, who was the project&rsquo;s Reporter, and Lewis &amp; Clark Law School Dean Robert Klonoff and University of Texas law professor Charles Silver, who served as Associate Reporters along with Professor Nagareda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The impetus for this book was the fact that we&rsquo;ve had the modern class action lawsuit for more than 40 years,&rdquo; Nagareda said. &ldquo;In that time, we&rsquo;ve learned a lot about how this type of litigation works, the problems it can generate, where it works best, and where it does not work. The book is designed to build on our 40-plus years of real-world experience and offer guidance to judges and lawyers who are dealing with aggregate litigation in various forms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book provides an overview of mass disputes in modern society and discusses key concepts in the field, which has changed significantly in recent years. The content is divided into three chapters: The first defines and categorizes the varieties of aggregate litigation today, of which class actions are just one part. The second focuses on the certification principles for class actions. The third analyzes the settlement of both class and non-class aggregate litigation, including the &ldquo;aggregate settlement rule&rdquo; in legal ethics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The process for amending the rules of civil procedure has become a very open, very public process, and one that moves very slowly,&rdquo; Nagareda said. &ldquo;In this book, we could examine the hot-button issues from all sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One topic Nagareda addressed was class certification. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old saying that you don&rsquo;t realize how beautiful the world is until you try to paint it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t realized how far we had gotten toward developing a genuine law of class certification until we came to the point of laying out the governing principles. I think we&rsquo;re actually in a pretty sensible place on this topic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American Law Institute initially approached leading scholars of aggregate litigation seven years ago, and the book is the product of careful collaboration among the reporters and advisors on the project, who included leading judges, practicing lawyers, and scholars versed in the realities of aggregate litigation. Notwithstanding numerous ongoing controversies about litigation in American society, the project ultimately garnered the unanimous approval of the ALI membership at its annual meeting in 2009.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first body of proposals that aims to organize and clarify the way the American legal system deals with mass disputes,&rdquo; Issacharoff said. &ldquo;No systematic review of these types of cases existed before. As an increasing number of countries around the world are beginning to deal with aggregate cases for the first time, this text will serve as a valuable resource and model in navigating this crucial field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result, the project has garnered international attention, being presented at scholarly conferences at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, in 2008, and at Renmin University in Beijing, China, in 2009. The project also will be the subject of a forthcoming symposium issue of the George Washington Law Review, which will feature commentary by leading scholars of civil procedure and legal ethics.</p>
<p>The book combines clear black-letter provisions with extensive explanatory comments, clarifying illustrations, and detailed reporters&rsquo; notes. The book can be ordered in hard-copy form from the ALI: www.ali.org. Its contents are also available for legal research via Westlaw.</p>

http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=329</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=329</link><description><![CDATA[<p>In his dissent in <em>Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB</em>, Justice Stephen Breyer cited two articles published in the November 2009 issue of <em><a href="http://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt Law Review En Banc</a></em>. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion for himself and four justices; Justice Breyer was joined in his dissent by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Sotomayor.<br />
<br />
The case involved a challenge by a free-enterprise group and a Nevada accounting firm to the constitutionality of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), whose members are appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The plaintiffs asserted that the oversight board&rsquo;s organization violated constitutional principles on separation of powers. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the removal provisions were unconstitutional and severed the relevant portions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which was passed in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals to combat corporate accounting fraud.<br />
<br />
In his dissent, Justice Breyer cited two articles published in<em> Vanderbilt Law Review En Banc</em>, the <em>Law Review</em>&rsquo;s recently created online companion. Those two articles were <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/articles/2009/11/Bruff-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-63.pdf">&ldquo;Bringing the Independence Agencies in from the Cold&rdquo;</a> by University of Colorado law professor Harold Bruff and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbiltlawreview.org/articles/2009/11/Pildes-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-85.pdf">&ldquo;Putting Power Back into Separation of Powers Analysis: Why the SEC-PCAOB Structure Is Constitutional&rdquo;</a> by New York University law professor Richard H. Pildes. Justice Breyer cited Pildes&rsquo;s article as &ldquo;explaining further the comprehensive nature of the SEC&rsquo;s powers,&rdquo; and Bruff&rsquo;s article as &ldquo;noting that &lsquo;Presidents do not test the limits of their power by removing commissioners.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The November 2009 issue of<em> En Banc </em>introduced a new feature called &ldquo;Roundtable,&rdquo; which was launched by the <em><a href="retCmsId=1615">Vanderbilt Law Review</a> </em>specifically for the purpose of providing a forum for law professors and practitioners to debate significant, pending Supreme Court cases, according to Ryan Holt, who served as the <em>Law Review</em>'s&nbsp;Editor-in-Chief in 2009-10. The <em>En Banc </em>edition devoted to PCAOB was the first &ldquo;Roundtable,&rdquo; and included short articles by Columbia University law professor Peter L. Strauss, Northwestern law professor Steven G. Calabresi, University of Pennsylvania law professor Christopher S. Yoo, and Boston University law professor Gary Lawson in addition to the articles by Bruff and Pildes.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;When we devised the idea of Roundtable in spring 2009, our greatest aspiration was that its articles might one day influence the workings of the Court,&rdquo; Holt said. &ldquo;None of us ever would have guessed, however, that our very first Roundtable would get cited by the Supreme Court&mdash;not once, but twice. It is a great accomplishment for our editors to discover and swiftly capitalize on this important niche of legal scholarship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>En Banc </em>was the brainchild of a talented group of <em>Law Review </em>editors who included [2010 graduates] Mac Conforti, Ryan Holt and Andrew Gould,&rdquo; Associate Dean <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=153">Lisa Bressman</a>, who recently completed a term as advisor to the <em>Vanderbilt Law Review</em>, said. &ldquo;The PCAOB exchange marked the launch of <em>En Banc</em> Roundtable. From the start, it attracted the participation of some of the most distinguished constitutional theory scholars.

<em>Vanderbilt Law Review </em>launched Roundtable to offer a more timely forum for scholarly debate on current legal issues with the benefit of shorter turnaround time afforded by online publication. &ldquo;We hope these debates will allow for participants to voice their views in a scholarly forum while the law is simultaneously being made at the highest levels,&rdquo; Holt said. The Fall 2010 Roundtable will feature the class-action case <em>Dukes v. Wal-Mart</em>.<br />

<p>Nashville Mayor Karl Dean received the TBA's William M. Leech Jr. Public Service Award for his extraordinary service to the people of Nashville and Middle Tennessee in the wake of devastating flooding last month. In addition to the timely and organized provision of basic services to flood victims, the award recognized&nbsp;Dean's commitment to the provision of pro bono legal services to those affected by the flooding. The Leech award is given annually by the TBA Young Lawyers Division Fellows and is named for former Attorney General William M. Leech.</p>
<p>Nashville&nbsp;attorney Steve Cobb&nbsp;received the&nbsp;TBA&nbsp;President&rsquo;s Award for his work furthering the association's legislative initiatives as its&nbsp;legislative counsel. Cobb is a solo practitioner in Nashville.</p>
<p>Memphis attorney Danny Van Horn took office as president-elect of the TBA on June 3. The move puts&nbsp;Van Horn&nbsp;in line to assume the presidency in June 2011 as the youngest member of the TBA to hold that office. Van Horn practices in the area of commercial litigation with Butler Snow O&rsquo;Mara Stevens &amp; Cannada, where he&nbsp;focuses on business torts, unfair competition, insurance disputes and product liability cases.</p>
<p>In addition, four&nbsp;Vanderbilt Law alumni&nbsp;completed the Tennessee Bar Association&rsquo;s Leadership Law Program, which is designed to equip lawyers with the vision, knowledge and skills necessary to serve as leaders in their profession and communities. Over the course of nine months, class members learn about state government, legislative procedure, Tennessee&rsquo;s judicial system and how to work with the media. This year&rsquo;s class included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>John Heacock, Class of 1994, a solo practitioner in Nashville who focuses on civil litigation, appellate practice and domestic relations law.</li>
    <li>Alonda McCutcheon, Class of 1992, a labor and employment lawyer with Bass Berry &amp; Sims in Nashville.</li>
    <li>Junaid Odubeko, Class of 2004, who serves as deputy legal counsel to Governor Phil Bredesen in Nashville.</li>
    <li>Sharon Reavis, Class of 2002, an attorney&nbsp;with EMI Christian Music Group, Inc., in Brentwood.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tennessee Bar Association is the largest professional association in Tennessee with more than 10,000 members. Founded in 1881, the TBA provides opportunities for continuing legal education, professional development and public service.</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=326">Karl Dean, Danny Van Horn, Steve Cobb and other VLS alumni recognized by Tennessee Bar Association</a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on Jun 23, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-06-23T12:32:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Samar Ali, Class of 2006, appointed White House Fellow</title><guid>

Ali, who earned her J.D. at Vanderbilt Law School in 2006, has been appointed a White House Fellow.</p>
<p>Ali is currently an associate with the law firm Hogan Lovells US, where she was a founding member of the firm&rsquo;s Abu Dhabi office and where her practice addresses mergers and acquisitions, cross-border transactions, Shari&rsquo;a compliant transactions, project finance and international business matters.</p>
<p>She is one of 13 men and women appointed to the 2010-11 class of&nbsp;White House Fellows, a program created in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to give promising American leaders &ldquo;first hand, high-level experience with the workings of the Federal government, and to increase their sense of participation in national affairs.&rdquo; Fellows also take part in an education program designed to broaden their knowledge of leadership, policy formulation, military operations and current affairs. Community service is an important component of the program, and Fellows participate in service projects throughout the year in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>
<p>Selection as a White House Fellow is based on a record of remarkable early career professional achievement, evidence of leadership potential, a proven commitment to public service, and the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute successfully at the highest levels of the Federal government. &quot;The program is&nbsp;focused on leadership and community service,&quot; Ali said. &quot;The opportunity to spend a year focusing on developing better leadership skills with some of the country's greatest leaders is a once in a lifetime opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p>Ali&nbsp;began seeking out leadership opportunities and training soon after starting to Vanderbilt, where she earned her undergraduate degree&nbsp;in political science with honors. During her freshman year, she co-founded the Middle Eastern Students Association and began her three-year involvement with Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Student Government Association by joining the multicultural committee and the SGA Future Leaders Program. Just two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Ali rose to an unofficial leadership position by speaking publicly about her Muslim faith and her religion's condemnation of the perpetrators' action. She was the university&rsquo;s first Arab-Muslim student body president. &quot;I think leadership training is&nbsp;critically important because&nbsp;it encourages you to self-reflect&nbsp;about what makes a good leader and about what you need to work on,&quot; Ali says. &quot; And I like the fact that you&rsquo;re never quite done&nbsp; &ndash; there&rsquo;s always something to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>During law school, Ali was a legal intern for Stites &amp; Harbison in Nashville from 2005-06, and she later interned for the Islamic International Arab Bank in Amman, Jordan.&nbsp;After earning her J.D.,&nbsp;she clerked for The Honorable Gilbert S. Merritt, Class of 1960, on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and for The Honorable Edwin Cameron, now of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, where she also worked extensively on editing his book, <em>Witness to AIDS</em>.</p>
<p>&quot;Samar was an amazingly well rounded and poised student who added a very valuable perspective to our student body and to the International Law Practice Lab,&quot; said Professor Mike Newton, who supervised a project Ali completed on comparative human rights in Islamic societies.</p>
<p>As a young professional in Nashville, Ali led the YMCA Israeli-Palestinian Modern Voices for Progress Program, and she&nbsp;is currently the transatlantic liaison for the development of the Palestine Diabetes Institute. She is a founding member of the first U.S. Delegation to the World Islamic Economic Forum, and has served as an Advisory Board Member of the Vanderbilt Institute for Global Health. She is also a three-time Southeastern Tae Kwon Do Black Belt Champion.</p>
<p>Ali was born at Vanderbilt Hospital -- &quot;Frank Boehm delivered me!&quot; she recalls&nbsp;--&nbsp;and reared in Waverly, Tennessee, where her parents, both doctors, run the Waverly Clinic. Her mother immigrated to the United States from Syria at age 26, and her father left the West Bank town of Ramallah at age 17.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Professor Haley was the William R. Ortwein Distinguished Professor of Law at Washington University Law School in St. Louis, where he directed the Whitney R. Harris Institute for Global Legal Studies from 2002-07. An internationally renowned scholar of comparative and international law and a pre-eminent scholar of Japanese law, his works have addressed international trade policy, comparative law, Japanese land-use law, Japanese and East Asian business transactions and Japanese law and contemporary society. His 1991 book, <em>Authority without Power: Law and the Japanese Paradox</em>, is a leading work in the field, and he was a pioneering scholar of Japanese law. Professor Haley retired from Washington University's law faculty this spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely pleased to announce that a scholar of John Owen Haley&rsquo;s stature is joining our international law faculty,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said. &ldquo;John is a highly regarded teacher and a pioneering scholar of comparative law. He will have an immediate positive impact on the life of our law school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Haley joined the law faculty at Washington University in 2000 after serving as the Garvey, Schubert and Barer Professor of Law and International Studies at the University of Washington in Seattle. He earned his A.B. at Princeton University&rsquo;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, his LL.B. at Yale Law School, and his LL.M. in Asian Law at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only describe the prospect of continuing my research and teaching in comparative law at Vanderbilt as exciting,&rdquo; Professor Haley said. &ldquo;The impressive quality of both faculty and students as well as Nashville&rsquo;s reputation and spectacular rise as a center of Japan-related economic and cultural activities make Vanderbilt Law School an ideal academic home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Haley&rsquo;s expertise as a scholar and his outstanding record as a teacher make him a wonderful addition to the International Legal Studies Program,&rdquo; said <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=219">Ingrid Wuerth</a>, who directs Vanderbilt&rsquo;s International Legal Studies Program. &ldquo;Faculty and students alike will benefit from his rich and nuanced scholarship in comparative law and other areas, as well as his broad range of intellectual interests and experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Founded in 1875, Vanderbilt University Law School trains excellent lawyers for careers throughout the nation and around the world. Located on the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, Tennessee, Vanderbilt Law School combines the advantages of a top-tier faculty, a stimulating university community; a small, carefully selected student body, and one of the nation&rsquo;s most modern, state-of-the-art facilities.</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=320">John Owen Haley, distinguished scholar of comparative law, joins Vanderbilt's faculty</a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on Jun 20, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-06-20T13:39:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Vanderbilt Law's tuition increase lowest since 1966</title><guid>
http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=321</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=321</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Dean Chris Guthrie has announced that Vanderbilt Law School&rsquo;s tuition for 2010-11 will increase by the smallest percentage since 1966 &ndash; 2.7 percent.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I am deeply concerned about the costs of legal education,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said. &ldquo;At Vanderbilt, we are committed to doing what we can to keep the cost of education down and to help each student maximize her return on her investment in us. In keeping with these dual goals, I am pleased to announce the smallest percentage increase in Vanderbilt Law School&rsquo;s tuition in nearly 45 years, and I&rsquo;m especially pleased that we&rsquo;ve been able to achieve this low tuition rate increase in an economic environment that has increased our students&rsquo; needs while reducing other sources of law school revenue.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Keeping tuition increases low is only one of the tactics the law school is using to support students during law school and after they graduate. For example, Vanderbilt has directed most of its discretionary dollars to student scholarships, and Guthrie has also made scholarship support a principal fundraising goal. Currently, 70 percent of Vanderbilt Law students receive scholarship support, and the median scholarship award is $15,000 per year. As Guthrie points out, this means that the median scholarship recipient receives more than a one-third discount off tuition. &ldquo;In round numbers,&rdquo; Guthrie notes, &ldquo;our median scholarship recipient pays for two years of law school and gets the third year for free.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
The law school has also doubled its support for summer public interest stipends. These stipends, which provide modest support to students for either half or all of the summer, enable students to pursue public interest internships in legal settings. In 2009, 28 students received half-summer stipends and 22 received full-summer stipends. In 2010, by contrast, 55 students received half-summer stipends and 27 received full-summer stipends. Through these stipends, Vanderbilt law students are working with public interest, government or public policy organizations in&nbsp;17 states and Washington, D.C., and in&nbsp;10 foreign nations. <br />
<br />
In addition, the law school has invested heavily in career services by hiring an additional career advisor, bringing its Career Services staff to five career advisors. The staff includes Assistant Dean Elizabeth Workman, who heads the program, and six others. Vanderbilt has also retained a consultant to work with students who would like to pursue entrepreneurial careers in the non-profit and public interest sectors, and again&nbsp;funded the Vanderbilt Public Service Initiative, which provides modest stipends to graduates working in public interest legal settings for up to seven months.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;These initiatives cost a lot of money &ndash; several million dollars annually &ndash; but they are important for our students and young graduates,&rdquo; Guthrie observed. &ldquo;To the extent possible, we will continue to do what we can to direct discretionary dollars to our students.&rdquo;<br />

Cheng to Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce that Ed Cheng, a first-rate scholar who brings a unique perspective to the study of evidence law, will join our law faculty,&rdquo; Dean Chris Guthrie said.</p>
<p>Professor Cheng has been appointed professor of law. He joins Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty from Brooklyn Law School, where he was a professor of law. His research focuses on scientific and expert evidence, and the interaction between law and statistics. He holds a B.S.E. (summa cum laude) in electrical engineering from Princeton University, an M.Sc. in information systems (with distinction) from the London School of Economics and Political Science, where he was a Fulbright Scholar, a J.D. (cum laude) from Harvard Law School, and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in statistics at Columbia University. He is co-author of <em>Modern Scientific Evidence </em>(West 2009-10), and his articles have been published in the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>, the<em> Stanford Law Review</em>, the <em>Michigan Law Review</em>, the <em>Duke Law Review </em>and the <em>Northwestern Law Review</em>, among others. He will teach evidence, torts, and a seminar on statistical inference and law.</p>
<p>&quot;Ed Cheng's move to Vanderbilt will cement our <a href="retCmsId=923">Branstetter Litigation and Dispute Resolution Program</a>'s status as one of the true powerhouse centers for research about our civil litigation system,&quot; said Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=183">Richard Nagareda</a>, who heads the Branstetter Program. &quot;Across a vast swath of litigation contexts today, debate centers on aggregate statistical analysis. This is true all the way from an individual tort case to a multimillion-dollar employment discrimination class action. Ed's doctoral work in statistical analysis gives him a unique tool set to translate social science into law, and vice versa.&quot;</p>
<p>Professor Cheng will also be affiliated&nbsp;with&nbsp;Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Criminal Law Program, headed by <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=225">Christopher Slobogin</a>, a criminal law expert who holds the Milton Underwood Chair in Law. &ldquo;Ed will provide a real interdisciplinary boost to our program,&rdquo; Professor Slobogin stated. &ldquo;He is producing some of the most exciting work in academia on the intersection of science and proof issues, an area that is extremely important in criminal law domains as diverse as the investigative profiling, the insanity defense and assessments of dangerousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Cheng will spend the 2010-11 year completing coursework at Columbia University and begin teaching at Vanderbilt in fall 2011.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have long been impressed by the energy and quality of the Vanderbilt faculty and its commitment to interdisciplinary studies,&rdquo; Professor Cheng said. &ldquo;I very much look forward to becoming a member of the community and hope to contribute to that tradition.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
Seymore has been appointed Associate Professor of Law. He joins Vanderbilt from the faculty of Washington &amp; Lee University, where he had been an assistant professor of law since 2008. <br />
<br />
Professor Seymore&rsquo;s research focuses on how patent law should evolve in response to scientific advances and how the intersection of law and science should influence the formulation of public policy. Professor Seymore was a visiting professor of law at Northwestern University from 2007-08.</p>
<p>He earned a B.S. in chemistry as a Tennessee Scholar at the University of Tennessee, an M.S. in chemistry from the Georgia Institute of Technology, a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Notre Dame with an Arthur J. Schmitt Presidential Fellowship, and a J.D. at the University of Notre Dame with an Allen Endowment Fellowship. <br />
<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased to announce that Sean Seymore will join our law faculty,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said. &ldquo;As a chemist and a lawyer, he brings an important perspective to the study of patent law and to the examination of the intersection of law and science. He&rsquo;s a valuable addition to our accomplished faculty in both intellectual property and law and science.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Professor Seymore will join fellow intellectual property scholars, <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=226">Daniel Gervais</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=174">Steven Hetcher</a>.

She joins Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty from the University of Southern California, where she was Associate Director of LL.M. Legal Writing and Advocacy and an adjunct assistant professor of legal writing and advocacy.<br />
<br />
As Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Director of Legal Writing, Professor Lefko will head a faculty of eight experienced legal writing teachers.<br />
<br />
Professor Lefko earned her undergraduate degree in economics and Japanese language and culture from the University of Michigan (magna cum laude), and her J.D. from Harvard Law School, where she was an executive editor of the Harvard Law Review. She began her legal career with a two-year clerkship for the Honorable Haldane Robert Mayer on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., and also clerked for the Honorable Laughlin E. Waters on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles. She also worked as a research attorney for the Los Angeles Superior Court.<br />
<br />
Professor Lefko was an associate with Irell &amp; Manella in Los Angeles before launching her own private research and consulting practice in 2003. As a consultant, she has written more than 100 custom research memoranda for LRN, a Los Angeles-based legal research company where she had previously served as manager of legal research.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Our Legal Research &amp; Writing Program is an extremely important part of the first-year curriculum, and I&rsquo;m delighted that Tami is joining us to lead it,&rdquo; Dean Guthrie said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that Tami and our team of outstanding and dedicated instructors will take an already strong program and make it even stronger.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;I am really excited about the opportunity to direct Vanderbilt's Legal Writing program and to work with Dean Guthrie and this fantastic group of students, librarians, faculty and staff,&rdquo; Professor Lefko said. &ldquo;I look forward to helping the J.D. and LL.M. students to master these important skills.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Founded in 1875, Vanderbilt Law School trains excellent lawyers for careers throughout the nation and around the world. Located on the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, Tennessee, Vanderbilt combines the advantages of a top-tier faculty, a stimulating university community; a small, carefully selected student body, and one of the nation&rsquo;s most modern, state-of-the-art facilities.</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=322">Tami Lefko joins Vanderbilt Law School as Director of Legal Writing</a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on May 08, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-05-08T15:30:00</pubDate></item><item><title>35 Vanderbilt law students to serve in international law externships and placements</title><guid>

<p>&quot;Our students have accepted positions with 27 different international organizations, consulates, government agencies, and NGOs, and they will be working in 13 foreign countries and in the U.S.,&quot; said Professor Mike Newton, who coordinates a broad range of international and other externship opportunities for an increasing number of interested students. &quot;This is an impressive array of public service and experiential learning, due in large part to the substantive preparation of our students and the intellectual daring it takes to follow their convictions into demanding legal environments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several students are serving externships&nbsp;associated with complex projects they also worked on as part of the&nbsp;International Law Practice Lab Professor Newton teaches each semester. &quot;Dean Chris Guthrie has been generous in funding a special summer stipend program for externships and placements,&quot; Newton said. &quot;This program, which is in addition to Public Interest Law stipends, provides financial support and helps defray the costs of overseas travel for some students.&quot; Other students benefit from the law school's Ones Polk Fund,&nbsp;a donor-supported fund that provides financial&nbsp;support for students pursuing international projects.<br />

She has the academic values, interpersonal skills, and judgment necessary to flourish in this important position.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bressman joined Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty in 1998 after working in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice and the law firm of Kellogg Huber Hansen Todd Evans, and Figel in Washington, D.C.

Dalton</a>, Class of 1975, was elected chairman-elect and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/boardoftrust/cmembers/moore.html">Jackson W. Moore</a>, Class of 1973, was elected vice-chair-elect of the Vanderbilt University Board of Trust Friday, April 23.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dalton will succeed current board chair <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/boardoftrust/cmembers/ingramm.html">Martha R. Ingram</a>, who will step down in June 2011. Moore&nbsp;and fellow trustee <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/boardoftrust/cmembers/mulford.html">Nancy&nbsp;Mulford</a>&nbsp;will succeed current vice-chairs&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/boardoftrust/cmembers/bottorff.html">Dennis Bottorff</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/boardoftrust/cmembers/berger.html">Darryl Berger</a>, also in 2011. The board also elected <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/boardoftrust/cmembers/hayes.html">Joanne F. Hayes</a> as secretary-elect.</p>
<p>Ingram, who has partnered with three chancellors for more than a decade to spearhead and support some of Vanderbilt&rsquo;s most ambitious initiatives, will become an emerita member of the board beginning in the summer of 2011. Ingram explained she decided to give a year&rsquo;s notice in order to allow an orderly transition to new leadership. &ldquo;Mark and I will work together in the next year to ensure that Vanderbilt loses none of its momentum going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under Martha&rsquo;s leadership as board chairman, Vanderbilt has made extraordinary strides in nearly every area,&rdquo; Dalton said. &ldquo;I will spend this next year working with and learning from her as we move toward this leadership transition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha&rsquo;s footprint on Vanderbilt is wide, deep and lasting,&rdquo; said Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos. &ldquo;Over the next year, we will celebrate appropriately her leadership, but Martha, the board and I have much to accomplish with her at the helm until next summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanderbilt is fortunate to have such an accomplished leader in Mark Dalton as chairman-elect,&rdquo; Zeppos said. &ldquo;Mark&rsquo;s business and strategic expertise have served the university well, and I look forward to working with him during the transition and as board chairman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dalton, a 1975 graduate of the Vanderbilt Law School, is co-chairman and CEO of Tudor Investment Corporation and its affiliates. Before joining Tudor in 1988, Dalton spent nine years with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company as a senior executive and four years with the law firm of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell as an attorney in New York City.</p>
<p>Dalton has been a member of Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Board of Trust since 2002. He also has been a member of the board of trustees of Denison University, where he received his bachelor of arts, since 1990. He served as chairman of the Denison board from 2003 to 2009.</p>
<p>Moore also joined Vanderbilt's Board of Trust in 2002. Before earning his J.D. at Vanderbilt Law School in 1973, he earned a B.S. from the University of Alabama.&nbsp;He was the managing partner in one of Memphis&rsquo; largest law firms prior to joining Union Planters Corporation in 1989. He was the chairman, president, and CEO of Union Planters when it merged with Regions Financial in mid-2004, and became&nbsp;chairman and CEO of Regions Financial in 2005. Following&nbsp;a merger of Regions Financial and AmSouth Bancorporation, both headquartered in Birmingham, he became Executive Chairman of the consolidated company, one of the 10 largest bank holding companies headquartered in the U.S.&nbsp;He retired&nbsp;at the end of 2007.&nbsp;In addition to serving on Vanderbilt's Board of Trust, Moore also chairs the President&rsquo;s Cabinet at the University of Alabama.</p>
<p>&quot;I am delighted that Mark and Jack are assuming leadership roles on the Board of Trust,&quot; Vanderbilt Law Dean Chris Guthrie said. &quot;They have both contributed significantly to the Law School and the University, and their election as Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board of Trust is emblematic of the leadership roles that Vanderbilt Law graduates frequently play.&quot;</p>
<p>Ingram was first elected to the Board of Trust in June 1995 following the death of her husband, E. Bronson Ingram, who served on the board from 1967 to 1995, including the last four years as chairman. In joining the board, she continued the Ingram family&rsquo;s service to Vanderbilt that began when Bronson Ingram&rsquo;s father, Orrin Henry, joined the board in 1952. Remaining as trustees after their mother&rsquo;s move to emerita status will be two of Ingram&rsquo;s sons, Orrin and John.</p>
<p>Elected board chairman in 1997 during the administration of Chancellor Joe B. Wyatt, Ingram was instrumental in the selection of former Chancellor Gordon Gee in 2000 and of Zeppos in 2008. In the ensuing years under Ingram&rsquo;s leadership, the board has provided support for many of the university&rsquo;s ambitious undertakings, including the $1.75 billion Shape the Future campaign; The Commons and the move toward College Halls; increases in financial aid to help eliminate student debt; and the Medical Center&rsquo;s expansive outreach and services, including the establishment of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Health Alliance, the opening of the Monroe Carell Jr. Children&rsquo;s Hospital, the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center and Vanderbilt Health One Hundred Oaks.</p>
<p>The Ingram family is Vanderbilt&rsquo;s most generous benefactor. Their contributions include funding of cancer research, support for the arts, and endowment of faculty chairs and scholarships, including the Ingram Scholars program.</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=314">Mark Dalton '75 and Jack Moore '73 to assume leadership roles on VU Board of Trustees</a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on Apr 23, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-04-23T17:32:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Maria Glover, Class of 2007, awarded fellowship at Harvard</title><guid>

Climenko Fellowships are awarded to promising legal scholars with high academic achievements and a strong interest in teaching. Fellows devote two years to legal scholarship and gain teaching experience, all in preparation for entry into the legal academy.</p>
<p>During law school, Glover served as Senior Articles Editor of the <em>Vanderbilt Law Review</em>. Upon graduation, she clerked for Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Charlottesville, Virginia, and&nbsp;then joined Mayer Brown in Washington, D.C., as an associate in the firm&rsquo;s Supreme Court and appellate practice group. She will join the 2010-12 class of Climenko Fellows on July 1.</p>
<p>Glover tracks her interest in academic research to her Law Review note, which focused on the area of complex litigation, and to Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=183">Richard Nagareda</a>&rsquo;s Complex Litigation course and third-year Civil Litigation Capstone Seminar, which afforded her an opportunity to write a substantive scholarly paper. &ldquo;Those experiences solidified my interest in research focusing on complex litigation. Further, during my clerkship, Judge Wilkinson was very supportive and encouraging when I expressed an interest in an academic career,&rdquo; Glover said. While at Vanderbilt, she also participated in the Vanderbilt Scholars program, a selective program overseen by then-Associate Dean Chris Guthrie for students with a long-term interest in academic careers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maria&rsquo;s appointment as a Climenko Fellow at Harvard is no surprise to those of us who had the privilege of teaching her,&rdquo; Professor Nagareda said. &ldquo;Never before in my experience has a student so firmly stamped her intellectual charisma on the Vanderbilt faculty. We&rsquo;re pleased that a graduate of our Vanderbilt Scholars program has secured a top fellowship that is among the prime stepping stones for the legal academy. And I&rsquo;m personally delighted that her research agenda draws on her studies here as part of our <a href="retCmsId=923">Branstetter Litigation &amp; Dispute Resolution Program</a> as well as her hands-on experience in the real world of civil litigation practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a Climenko Fellow, Glover plans to further examine class actions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to explore a conceptual question that actually builds on the Note I wrote at Vanderbilt,&rdquo; Glover says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in the class action mechanism because of its unique interrelationship with and very strong potential influence on the vindication of substantive rights.&rdquo;</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=312">Maria Glover, Class of 2007, awarded fellowship at Harvard</a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on Apr 20, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-04-20T14:49:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Jay Angoff, Class of 1978, named director of new Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight</title><guid>

http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=309</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=309</link><description><![CDATA[<p>William Corr, Class of 1973, who was appointed Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services by President Obama &nbsp;in January 2009, addressed the reasoning behind the recently passed health reform legislation&rsquo;s controversial mandate that Americans who aren&rsquo;t currently covered under an employer-provided medical plan, Medicare or Medicaid must purchase some form of health insurance in his talk at Vanderbilt Law School on April 8.</p>
<p>The overhaul also requires that&nbsp;insurance companies cover everyone, including those with pre-existing conditions, and for&nbsp;such a system to work,&nbsp;&quot;you have to bring everyone in and create a healthier insurance pool,&rdquo;&nbsp;Corr said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t require everyone to have insurance, sick&nbsp;people will come into the plan while healthier people stay out&rdquo; until they develop a health issue and need coverage. &ldquo;The legislation also&nbsp;establishes many new rules&rdquo; to help individuals get and keep insurance, he said, including one rule particularly important to Americans who must rely on individual coverage: &ldquo;An insurance company can&rsquo;t drop you when you get sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his hour-long talk to an audience that included students and faculty from Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law, medical and business schools, Corr did not dwell on the Obama Administration&rsquo;s bruising battle to pass the landmark legislation. After providing an overview of what the health care overhaul would accomplish, Corr discussed the scope of the overhaul, which addresses not only accessibility of medical insurance, but also calls for the implementation of electronic medical records, bolsters support for primary care clinics and personnel in underserved areas, and devotes additional resources to detecting Medicare and Medicaid fraud.</p>
<p>Corr also addressed concerns about the impact and implementation of the health care overhaul. &ldquo;We know how to do public health better than we have been,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Corr noted that some provisions of the legislation will not take effect until 2014. &ldquo;Being responsible for implementation, that feels like it&rsquo;s the next day,&rdquo; he said. Intermediate steps in the overhaul include curbs on some industry practices. Starting this summer, for example, dependent children may remain covered under a parent&rsquo;s medical insurance plan through age 26. &ldquo;No children with pre-existing conditions can be denied coverage,&rdquo; Corr said. &ldquo;The legislation also bans lifetime and annual caps on coverage. And it establishes rate review authority; to the extent that insurers spend less than 85 percent of premiums providing for health care, we can order rebates to individual insureds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the challenge he and his colleagues face in implementing the massive overhaul, Corr said, &ldquo;Thirty-seven years ago, I thought it would be really cool to be involved in the health system as a lawyer, and today, I wouldn&rsquo;t be anywhere else in the world.&rdquo; Corr credited Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=151">James Blumstein</a>, a nationally renowned health law scholar who joined Vanderbilt's law faculty in 1970, with sparking his interest in health law and policy.</p>
<p>Corr&rsquo;s appearance at the law school was sponsored by the <a href="retCmsId=1217">Health Law Society</a> and underwritten by the Hyatt Student Activities Fund. He was introduced by 3L <a href="retCmsId=2068">C.J. Stimson</a>, who will graduate with a J.D./M.D. from Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law and medical schools this year. Stimson will start his surgical residency at Vanderbilt Medical Center this summer.</p>
<p>Corr has devoted his career to addressing health policy issues. Before he was appointed Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services by President Obama in early 2009, Corr spent nine years as the executive director of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a private, non-profit organization that advocated policies and actions to reduce tobacco use among both children and adults.</p>
<p>Corr earned his undergraduate degree in economics at the University of Virginia. Immediately after earning his law degree at Vanderbilt, he spent four years directing four private, non-profit, community-run health centers in Appalachia. He moved to Washington, D.C., in 1977, to serve as an attorney for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, working first for Representative Paul Rogers (D-FL) and then for Representation Henry Waxman (D-CA) as counsel to the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. In the late 1980s, Corr moved to the Senate to serve as chief council and staff director of the Judiciary subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights under Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH); he also assisted Metzenbaum as a member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.</p>
<p>Corr joined the Department of Health and Human Services during the Clinton Administration, serving as the agency&rsquo;s Chief of Staff and as principal advisor to Secretary Donna E. Shalala on policy and management issues and initiatives. Corr worked as chief counsel and policy director for Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle from 1998 through 2000 before joining the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids.<br />

Speir Professor of Law, is the 2010 winner of the Alexander Heard Distinguished Service Professor Award.&nbsp;This award, created in honor of Chancellor&nbsp;Alexander Heard when he retired in 1982, recognizes a full-time faculty member at Vanderbilt University whose research&nbsp;has made distinctive contributions to the understanding of problems of contemporary society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy serves as a model of how academia can impact our nation&rsquo;s legal system,&rdquo; Vanderbilt Chancellor Nick Zeppos said. &ldquo;She plays a vital role in shaping the criminal justice system at both the federal and state levels as a member of the prestigious Advisory Committee of the United States Judicial Conference on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which is responsible for proposing changes in the rules of procedure used in every federal criminal proceeding. She ranks among the nation&rsquo;s top five contributors to the field of criminal procedure and perhaps the leading scholar on reform of habeas corpus litigation in the federal court system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor&nbsp;King is an expert in the field of criminal procedure. She recently led a national study of habeas litigation in U.S. District Courts funded by an award from the National Institute of Justice. She has authored or co-authored two&nbsp;important treatises on criminal procedure and the leading criminal procedure casebook as well as more than two dozen articles and book chapters. Her work focuses on the post-investigative features of the criminal process, including plea bargaining, trials, juries, evidence, sentencing, appeals, double jeopardy and post-conviction review.</p>
<p>Professor King served as a member of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure of the U.S. Judicial Conference for six years and presently serves the committee as as&nbsp;Assistant Reporter. In 2005, she received the Chancellor&rsquo;s Award for Research at Vanderbilt for her research on jury sentencing, &quot;Jury Sentencing in Practice: A Three-State Study&quot; (with Rosevelt Noble, published in 57<em> Vanderbilt Law Review </em>885, 2004).</p>
<p>Professor&nbsp;King received a&nbsp;$2,500 award and an engraved silver tray, and she will be designated the Alexander Heard Distinguished Service Professor for 2010-11.</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=305">Nancy King receives Alexander Heard Distinguished Service Award </a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on Apr 09, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-04-09T14:32:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Nita Farahany to be appointed to Presidential Commission on Bioethics</title><guid>

<p>[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts-4-7-10">Read the White House press release</a>]</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the&nbsp;White House April 7, the commission will advise President Obama on legal, philosophical and social issues arising from developments in the biosciences and propose policies to ensure scientific research, health care delivery, and technological innovation are conducted in an ethically responsible manner. &ldquo;As our nation invests in science and innovation and pursues advances in biomedical research and health care, it&rsquo;s imperative that we do so in a responsible manner,&quot; President Obama said.</p>
<p>Professor Farahany is a leading expert on the intersection of law and science whose recent work examines the impact of developments related to behavioral genetics and neuroscience on philosophical and practical approaches to criminal and constitutional&nbsp;law. In her current research, she examines how emerging research in the biosciences informs agency and responsibility theory, and challenges existing doctrines in constitutional law. Her edited collection, <em>The Impact of Behavioral Sciences on Criminal Law</em>, (Oxford University Press, 2009), is a compendium of interdisciplinary essays, including her chapter on &quot;Genetics, Neuroscience, and Criminal Responsibility.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Advances in science and technology hold great promise for deepening our understanding of the natural world, and for improving institutions dedicated to health, law and national security,&quot; Professor Farahany said. &quot;But such developments also present new challenges to cherished American ideals and constitutional doctrines. I am honored by President Obama's intent to appoint me to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethics, and for the opportunity to help inform the ethical, legal and policy debates concerning scientific progress.&quot;</p>
<p>[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/authors/nitafarahany">Hear Professor Farahany discuss The Impact of Behavioral Sciences on Criminal Law</a>]</p>
<p>Professor Farahany graduated from Dartmouth College with a degree in genetics, cell and developmental biology, and from Harvard University with a master's degree in biology. She earned her J.D., M.A., and Ph.D. in Philosophy of Biology and Jurisprudence at Duke University. Before joining Vanderbilt&rsquo;s law faculty, Professor&nbsp;Farahany clerked for the Honorable Judith W. Rogers on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. She has presented her work on bioethics, neuroethics, criminal law, and behavioral health law and policy to wide-ranging audiences, including the Second Circuit Judicial Conference, the National Judicial College, the Stanford Center for the Integration of Research on Genetics and Ethics, the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the American Society for Political and Legal Philosophy. She is a member of the New York Bar, the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, and the Society for Neuroethics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an incredible honor for Nita, the Law School, and Vanderbilt University,&rdquo; said Chris Guthrie, Dean of Vanderbilt Law School. &ldquo;I commend the White House for appointing Nita to this commission. She has significant expertise in at least three disciplines relevant to the questions this body will be called upon to address and possesses judgment beyond her years.&rdquo;</p>

Charney Distinguished&nbsp;Lecture in International Law</a>, which he delivered at Vanderbilt Law School April 6.</p>
<p>Ambassador Wenaweser is a seasoned diplomat who has served as Permanent Representative to the United Nations for the Principality of Liechtenstein since 2002. He has devoted more than a decade to assisting with the establishment of the ICC, the world&rsquo;s first permanent, treaty-based international criminal court.</p>
<p>As a leader in the efforts of states worldwide&nbsp;to work together to form the ICC, Ambassador Wenaweser provided a brief overview of the&nbsp;lengthy negotiations leading up to the ICC's formation as well as some of the operational and legal challenges the Court has faced during its early years. The ICC's history, he noted, actually dates back to the&nbsp; aftermath of the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1946, when some academics initially proposed the creation of a permanent international court. However, the&nbsp;use of the United Nations&nbsp;Security Council to establish the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the Former Yugoslavia&nbsp;ultimately provided the&nbsp;impetus for states to collaborate to establish a new, independent&nbsp;treaty-based court.</p>
<p>The Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC,&nbsp;created the court as a permanent institution that operates outside&nbsp;the political context of the United Nations.&nbsp;The Rome Statute defines a limited scope of jurisdiction rather than conveying authority over all listed crimes under all circumstances. &ldquo;The ICC only has jurisdiction over what we call &lsquo;core crimes&rsquo; &ndash; genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes,&rdquo; Ambassador Wenaweser said. States that ratify the Rome Statute accept the ICC's jurisdiction only&nbsp;for these crimes, and they&nbsp;waive any claims to immunity of their civilian and military leaders based on their positions or official actions.</p>
<p>Ambassador Wenaweser emphasized that the Rome Statute contains a complicated set of provisions designed to ensure that the ICC does not override the prerogatives of domestic prosecutors. The ICC was created to serve as an independent &ldquo;institution of last resort,&quot; he explained. &quot;It only kicks in where the national court that should be responsible for prosecuting these crimes doesn&rsquo;t do it, either because it lacks capacity, or because it is not willing to exercise its jurisdiction. Only in these cases does the ICC have jurisdiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based in The Hague, Netherlands, the ICC currently has open investigations or warrants of arrest in cases against four Ugandans, including Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony; three Congolese warlords; three former government and military leaders in Darfur, Sudan; and a former government official in the Central African Republic. Only days before Ambassador Wenaweser's lecture at Vanderbilt,&nbsp;the ICC prosecutor opened a new investigation into the violence surrounding the elections in Kenya, using his independent authority under the Rome Statute&nbsp;for the first time.</p>
<p>Ambassador Wenaweser emphasized that the ICC does not intervene if a country is capable, as Iraq was, of forming its own criminal tribunal. The Iraqi High Tribunal that prosecuted Saddam Hussein and other officials in his regime for their role in campaigns of genocide, which was formed with assistance from U.S. legal advisors,&nbsp;was administered by the Iraqi government. In addition, Ambassador Wenaweser stressed that the Rome Statute is not retroactive, so infamous crimes against humanity such as Cambodia&rsquo;s &lsquo;killing fields,&rsquo; which occurred before the Rome Statute entered into force on July 1, 2002, are not subject to investigation or prosecution by the court.</p>
<p>While the ICC also has jurisdiction over crimes of &lsquo;aggression,&rsquo; he said,&nbsp;delegates in Rome could not agree on formulations for this controversial offense. Thus, the Rome Statute does not currently define &lsquo;aggression,' and&nbsp;Article 5 of the statute states that the ICC will exercise its jurisdiction over crimes of aggression only after the states parties to the treaty agree on a definition. The ambassador chaired the ICC&rsquo;s Special Working Group on the Crime of Aggression from 2004-09, and after six years of work, he said, &ldquo;We have a draft definition that finds strong agreement among the states parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the second part of the discussion &ndash; the conditions under which the ICC would exercise its jurisdiction in cases of aggression &ndash; &ldquo;is more complex,&rdquo; Ambassador Wenaweser said. &ldquo;Aggression is a complex, two-layered crime&rdquo; that involves both the state that committed an act of aggression against another state and the person(s) who played a leading role in bringing the act of aggression about. Some states parties to the Rome Statute are uncomfortable with one proposed solution, which would allow the United Nations Security Council to determine when an act of aggression has occurred. If the Security Council alone was vested with this power, Ambassador Wenaweser said, &ldquo;you would have a situation in that probably the most political body in the world would make an essential decision to create jurisdiction for what is meant to be an independent criminal court. Most states believe that someone else should also have the power to make this determination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The definition of aggression will be one of the important&nbsp;issues discussed when states parties to the Rome Statute meet in Kampala in June, 2010. Although the United States&nbsp;has not ratified the Rome Statute,&nbsp;Ambassador Wenaweser welcomed the participation of the U.S. as an observer to the negotiations in Kampala.</p>
<p>To create the ICC, 60 countries initially ratified the Rome Statute, and 111 countries in all&nbsp;regions of the world&nbsp;are now party to the treaty. However, several major world powers, including United States, China, India and Russia, have yet to ratify the Rome Statute. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have an agreement from everyone that the Rome Statute is the best thing since sliced bread,&rdquo; Ambassador Wenaweser said, noting that smaller and medium-sized countries with governments who understood the need for an independent international criminal court were among the first to ratify the treaty. &ldquo;But we are on the way to where we want to be, which is to give this court universal coverage. We have to fight against impunity for these crimes, which are the most serious crimes under international law.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="retCmsId=738">The Jonathan I. Charney Distinguished Lecture in International Law</a> honors former Vanderbilt Law Professor Jonathan I. Charney, one of the world's preeminent experts on international law, who held the Lee S. &amp; Charles A. Speir Chair at the law school until his death in 2002. The series funds academic lectures and other presentations on international law by distinguished figures in the field.

<p>Mayor Dean announced the creation of the new Office of Environment and Sustainability and Bowles' appointment as its director at a &quot;Green Building&quot; panel discussion held at Vanderbilt Law School on April 1.&nbsp; &ldquo;This office will be led by one of your own, Chris Bowles,&rdquo; the mayor told&nbsp;the audience of the panel discussion, which was part of a conference hosted by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eli.org/">Environmental Law Institute</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="retCmsId=1759">Environmental Law and Policy &nbsp;Annual Review</a>, a compendium of recent scholarship addressing environmental law and policy produced in conjunction with Vanderbilt's <a href="retCmsId=939">Regulatory Program</a>.</p>
<p>Bowles currently is an attorney with Bass, Berry &amp; Sims,&nbsp;where he&nbsp;practices&nbsp;environmental law with a focus on the emerging areas of sustainability and climate change.</p>
<p>As Director of Environment and Sustainability, Bowles will oversee the continued<br />
implementation of the Mayor&rsquo;s Green Ribbon Committee report of recommendations, which was completed last June. In addition, Nashville has applied for a $6 million grant from the U.S.Department of Energy to fund energy efficiency and conservation projects in Metro. If awarded, Bowles will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the grant. Metro&rsquo;s grant application was heavily focused on green building projects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making real strides in environmental policy and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions<br />
requires working across many branches of government and understanding the complex issues and regulations that impact this area,&rdquo; Dean said. &ldquo;Chris is a bright, young attorney with a tremendous personal passion and professional interest in the environment. Being &lsquo;green&rsquo; is about ensuring Nashville is a healthy, viable city for generations to come, so that we continue to be a place where families want to live and businesses want to locate. I look forward to what Chris will help us achieve on this front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creating a Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Environment and Sustainability was one of 71<br />
recommendations outlined in the Green Ribbon Committee report. The recommendations were given a time value based on how easily they could be implemented. The Mayor&rsquo;s Office and other Metro departments have implemented or started work on implementing all of the recommendations listed as &ldquo;quick wins,&rdquo; and have begun planning and implementation for some of the mid- and long-range recommendations.</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=301">Chris Bowles '08 to head Metro Nashville's new Office of Environment and Sustainability</a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on Apr 02, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-04-02T13:49:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Should States Hold Power over Local Government to Encourage Green Design?

<p>The discussion was moderated by Linda Breggin, senior attorney with the Environmental Law Institute (ELI), an environmental policy organization based in Washington, D.C., and was held in conjunction with a conference addressing environmental law and policy sponsored by ELI and the <em>Environmental Law and Policy Annual Review</em> (ELPAR), a compendium of the best scholarly articles focusing on environmental law produced each year by ELI and&nbsp;Vanderbilt Law School. Environmental law expert Michael Vandenbergh, who co-directs Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Regulatory Program and serves as faculty advisor to the Environmental Law and Policy Annual Review, worked with Breggin and the ELPAR staff to organize the conference.</p>
<p>In her article, &ldquo;The Quiet Revolution Revived: Sustainable Design, Land Use Regulation, and the States&rdquo; (93 <em>Minnesota Law Review </em>231), Bronin advances what she terms the &ldquo;somewhat controversial&rdquo; argument that states should take a more active role in regulating local land use, and in particular in encouraging green and sustainable design. &ldquo;Green building is slowly transforming real estate development across the United States, bolstered by mounting evidence that conventional construction techniques substantially and unnecessarily damage the environment,&rdquo; Bronin asserts in her article. Over the next 20 years, she predicts, 75 percent of buildings will represent either new or replacement construction. Because local building codes vary widely, and many create logistical barriers to green building and sustainable design, while the need for energy efficient, sustainable design is immediate, Bronin proposes that states step in to regulate construction to speed the establishment of updated building codes that promote sustainable design.</p>
<p>In her response to Bronin&rsquo;s presentation, Brachman, whose organization addresses policies regarding preservation as well as sustainable design, proposed packaging green building requirements with other reforms designed to make local municipalities more competitive as they seek to attract and retain businesses.</p>
<p>Mathews, who develops and manages commercial properties, acknowledged that outdated building codes make implementing sustainable design difficult, but believes &ldquo;the local environment is the best place to carry out these ideas.&rdquo; Rather than attempting to establish state regulations addressing construction, Mathews proposed that state governments &ldquo;lead by example&rdquo; by instituting and adhering to green requirements for new state buildings. He also noted that the &ldquo;balance between historic preservation and green building codes is a very rough spot&rdquo; that policymakers in both groups need to work together to address.</p>
<p>The April 1 conference at Vanderbilt is one of two conferences convened by<em> ELPAR</em>. Four additional articles will be presented at a second conference&nbsp;hosted&nbsp;by the Environmental Law Institute&nbsp;in Washington, D.C., on Friday, April 16, 2010, 9 a.m.-1 p.m. Articles presented at that conference will include:</p>

&ldquo;Shannon has an outstanding passion to hone her already formidable human rights expertise in a field environment,&rdquo; Professor&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=212">Michael A. Newton</a>&nbsp;said. &ldquo;Her award is based on the selection committee&rsquo;s confidence that she will do &lsquo;high-quality international humanitarian legal work&rsquo; in Tanzania.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
Professor Newton encouraged Fyfe to propose a project working with the PILPG&rsquo;s field office in Tanzania because of her previous experiences working there, both during a summer internship secured through Vanderbilt&rsquo;s <a href="retCmsId=913">International Legal Studies Program</a> and as an undergraduate.<br />
<br />
Fyfe became aware of human rights issues relating to albino citizens in Tanzania during summer 2008, which she spent working as a legal intern with the Internal Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in the Tanzanian city of Arusha.&nbsp;While she was there, a&nbsp;friend&nbsp;emailed Fyfe <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/world/africa/08iht-tanzania.1.13549207.html">a New York Times article</a>&nbsp;which reported that albinos in Tanzania face the &ldquo;deadly threat&rdquo; of murder or mutilation because of a growing criminal trade in their body parts, used by witch doctors as ingredients in potions. &quot;In rural communities, when families have albino children, they go into hiding,&rdquo; Fyfe said. &ldquo;Their children don&rsquo;t leave the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albinism, a genetic condition that impairs normal skin pigmentation, is more common in sub-Saharan Africa than in much of the rest of the world, affecting one in 3,000 people in Tanzania as opposed to one in 20,000 people in the U.S.<br />
<br />
Fyfe will be working at a new field office established by the Public International Law and Policy Group to advise the Tanzanian government as it develops legislation to protect the human rights of the country&rsquo;s albino population.<br />
<br />
Fyfe earned her undergraduate degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she double-majored in political science and music and minored in women&rsquo;s studies.&nbsp; &quot;I always knew I wanted to pursue public interest law with an international focus,&quot; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been interested in international human rights since I was 20. I participated in a peace-and-conflict studies program in Uganda and Rwanda through UNC, studying genocide and gendered violence, and I attended a youth conference dealing with post-conflict reconstruction efforts in Uganda. While I was there, I fell in love with the people, culture and communities in the Lake Victoria basin.&rdquo; Fyfe also learned to speak &ldquo;a little Swahili&rdquo; during her previous stints in Africa.<br />
<br />
Fyfe will graduate this May with a J.D. from Vanderbilt Law School and a certificate in women&rsquo;s and gender studies from Vanderbilt University&rsquo;s Graduate School, which she earned concurrently.&nbsp;She is the 2009-10 executive director of Vanderbilt&rsquo;s <a href="retCmsId=1226">Legal Aid Society</a> and has also served on the boards of <a href="retCmsId=2146">Law Students for Social Justice</a> and the <a href="retCmsId=1240">Women Law Students Association</a>.</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=300">Shannon Fyfe, Class of 2010, wins Helton Fellowship for work in Tanzania</a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on Mar 23, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-03-23T17:14:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Should states hold power over local governments to encourage green design?</title><guid>

Petraeus, commander of U.S. Central Command, engaged in an open dialog at Vanderbilt University March 1, 2010, about his actions as commander of the surge in Iraq and the role of U.S. forces overseas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event was a conversation between General Petraeus and&nbsp;Michael&nbsp;Newton, professor of the practice of law, who is affiliated with Vanderbilt's International Legal Studies Program.</p>
<p>General Petraeus assumed command of the United States Central Command in October 2008. He had previously commanded&nbsp;the Multi-National Force-Iraq, spending more than 19 months at the helm of the Coalition force in Iraq.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous to his tour as MNF-I Commander, he commanded the U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth. Before that assignment, he was the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq, which he led from June 2004 to September 2005, and the NATO Training Mission- Iraq, which he commanded from October 2004 to September 2005. That deployment to Iraq followed his command of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), during which he led the &ldquo;Screaming Eagles&rdquo; in combat throughout the first year of Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>
<p>His command of the 101st followed a year deployed on Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia, where he was the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations of the NATO Stabilization Force and the Deputy Commander of the US Joint Interagency Counter-Terrorism Task Force-Bosnia. Prior to his tour in Bosnia, he spent two years at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, serving first as the Assistant Division Commander for Operations of the 82nd Airborne Division and then as the Chief of Staff of XVIII Airborne Corps.</p>
<p>General Petraeus was commissioned in the Infantry upon graduation from the United States Military Academy in 1974. He has held leadership positions in airborne, mechanized, and air assault infantry units in Europe and the United States, including command of a battalion in the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and a brigade in the 82nd Airborne Division. In addition, he has held a number of staff assignments: Aide to the Chief of Staff of the Army; battalion, brigade, and division operations officer; Military Assistant to the Supreme Allied Commander - Europe; Chief of Operations of the United Nations Force in Haiti; and Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>General Petraeus was the General George C. Marshall Award winner as the top graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College Class of 1983. He subsequently earned M.P.A. and Ph.D. degrees in international relations from Princeton University&rsquo;s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and later served as an Assistant Professor of International Relations at the US Military Academy. He also completed a fellowship at Georgetown University.</p>
<p>Awards and decorations earned by General Petraeus include two awards of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, two awards of the Distinguished Service Medal, two awards of the Defense Superior Service Medal, four awards of the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal for valor, the State Department Superior Honor Award, the NATO Meritorious Service Medal, and the Gold Award of the Iraqi Order of the Date Palm. He is a Master Parachutist and is Air Assault and Ranger qualified. He has also earned the Combat Action Badge and French, British, and German Jump Wings. In 2005, he was recognized by the <em>U.S. News and World Report </em>as one of America&rsquo;s 25 Best Leaders, and in 2007, he was named by <em>Time</em> magazine as one of the 100 most influential leaders and revolutionaries of the year and one of four runners-up for Time Person of the Year. Most recently, he was selected in a poll conducted by <em>Foreign Policy </em>and<em> Prospect </em>magazines as one of the world&rsquo;s top 100 public intellectuals and was chosen by <em>Esquire</em> magazine as one of the 75 Most Influential People of the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Professor Michael Newton is a West Point graduate who is an international legal adviser to the Iraqis and was one of the small team of international experts who taught them international criminal law and assisted with the trials.</p>
<p>The conversation was sponsored by the International Legal Studies Program and the College of Arts and Science.</p>

http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=295</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=295</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Kenneth Feinberg, the Special Master of Executive Pay for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), emphasized his &ldquo;very limited role in the public debate over executive compensation&rdquo; in the keynote address of an academic conference addressing Executive Compensation sponsored by Vanderbilt&rsquo;s <a href="retCmsId=907">Law and Business Program</a>. He also acknowledged that TARP&rsquo;s high visibility and the &ldquo;anger and frustration&rdquo; of the American taxpayers who funded the program has spotlighted his role in designating the compensation of employees at companies that received significant federal bailout funds through TARP.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://sitemason.vanderbilt.edu/news/video/2010/02/26/watch-ken-feinberg-obamas-executive-pay-czar.108124">See Feinberg's talk on streaming video</a></p>
<p>In his talk, Feinberg noted that his jurisdiction was limited to seven major public companies that received bailouts in 2009: Bank of America, Citigroup, AIG, General Motors, GMAC, Chrysler and Chrysler Financial. Feinberg was empowered under the statute to address the 2009 compensation of the top 100 employees in these seven companies, which involved calculating the compensation packages for the top 25 executives in each company and designing the compensation structures for the next 75 top employees. &ldquo;My mandatory jurisdiction in establishing compensation is very, very restricted by statute,&rdquo; Feinberg said.</p>
<p>Bank of America and Citigroup repaid the government at the end of 2009, and Feinberg&rsquo;s jurisdiction for 2010 is limited to the top 100 executives of the five remaining companies. &ldquo;With such a limited role,&rdquo; Feinberg asked rhetorically, &ldquo;why are the American people interested in what I&rsquo;m doing?&rdquo; In addition to &ldquo;anger and frustration on Main Street as to what&rsquo;s going on on Wall Street,&rdquo; he acknowledged, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only government official I know of who actually has authority to calculate individual compensation. It&rsquo;s one thing for various government agencies to fashion prescriptions about compensation. It&rsquo;s something quite different when you take the prescriptions and sit down with an adding machine and decide what these executives are going to get in actual dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feinberg has based salaries at the companies over which he has jurisdiction on a set of simple principles. &ldquo;Executives should receive a relatively modest cash-based salary &ndash; under $500,000 &ndash; as their only guaranteed compensation,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The rest of their salary will be in the form of &lsquo;salarized&rsquo; stock&rdquo; that cannot be redeemed immediately. His formula also limits executive perks to $25,000 per individual. &ldquo;No private jets, no country club dues, no golf club outings beyond that $25,000,&rdquo; Feinberg emphasized. The &ldquo;philosophic argument&rdquo; that any government interference in private pay is bad or wrong &ldquo;is trumped by the fact that my role is extremely limited, and by the fact that the taypayers own these companies,&rdquo; Feinberg said. His role as Special Master of Executive Pay will continue only &ldquo;as long as these companies owe the taxpayers money, and all the companies, to their credit, have a plan to repay the taxpayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In cases where companies are contractually obligated to pay executives an amount higher than Feinberg would normally authorize, he seeks to renegotiate their contracts to an arrangement that provides &ldquo;salarized&rdquo; stock rather than guaranteed bonuses or additional cash compensation. He is also empowered to &ldquo;claw back&rdquo; or recover compensation deemed excessive that was paid to any corporate official in any of the 400 companies that received TARP assistance. &ldquo;I may do that in companies where there are egregious examples of executive compensation,&rdquo; Feinberg said.</p>
<p>Feinberg&rsquo;s keynote address was part of a daylong Executive Compensation Conference was co-sponsored by the <a href="retCmsId=1615">Vanderbilt Law Review</a> and the Vanderbilt Law School&rsquo;s <a href="retCmsId=907">Law and Business Program</a>. Before his appointment as special master for executive pay for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, Feinberg served the federal government as special master for the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, which distributed nearly $7 billion to more than 5,000 victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. He is a partner in Feinberg Rosen, a New York firm he founded in 1993. <br />

Federal Election Commission.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=425500">Read an abstract of &ldquo;A Team Production Theory of Corporate Law&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>In a scathing dissent to <em>Citizens United </em>decision, which was handed down on January 21, Justice Stevens cited an article Blair coauthored with Lynn Stout of the UCLA School of Law, &ldquo;A Team Production Theory of Corporate Law&rdquo; (85 <em>Virginia Law Review </em>247, 1999) to support his assertions that &ldquo;corporations are different from human beings&rdquo; and that the decision in<em> Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, one of the cases cited by a lower-court panel which ruled against <em>Citizens United</em>, was not &ldquo;a radical outlier&rdquo; as the majority opinion claimed.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of Justice Stevens&rsquo; dissent, he excerpted a quote from the same article to address arguments made by the Court concerning the power of shareholders over the corporation: &ldquo;By &lsquo;corporate democracy,&rsquo; presumably the Court means the rights of shareholders to vote and to bring derivative suits for breach of fiduciary duty. In practice, however, many corporate lawyers will tell you that &lsquo;these rights are so limited as to be almost nonexistent,&rsquo; given the internal authority wielded by boards and managers and the expansive protections afforded by the business judgment rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In &ldquo;A Team Production Theory of Corporate Law,&rdquo; Blair and Stout defined corporations as &ldquo;a mediated hierarchy of stakeholders,&rdquo; and Justice Stevens listed their research among several recognized models of corporate structures in order to conclude that &ldquo;It is not necessary to agree on a precise theory of the corporation to agree that corporations differ from natural persons in a number of fundamental ways, and that a legislature might therefore need to regulate them differently if it is human welfare that is the object of its concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Team Production&rdquo; model was proposed by Blair and Stout as an alternative to the prevailing assumption that &ldquo;the central economic problem addressed by corporation law is getting managers and directors to act as loyal agents for shareholders,&rdquo; Blair explains. &ldquo;We took issue with the &lsquo;principal-agent approach and argued that the unique legal rules governing publicly-held corporations are instead designed primarily to address the problems that arise when a number of individuals with different interests must work together to invest corporate resources to jointly produce some good or service. We argued that the essential economic function of the public corporation is not to address principal-agent problems, but to provide a vehicle through which all corporate stakeholders can, for their own benefit, jointly relinquish control over those resources to a board of directors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The team production model was controversial, Blair acknowledges, because &ldquo;It suggests that maximizing shareholder wealth shouldn&rsquo;t be the overarching goal of corporate law,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The team production model suggests that directors of public corporations should seek to maximize the joint welfare of all the firm's stakeholders, including managers, employees, and possibly other groups such as creditors or the local community, in addition to shareholders.&rdquo;</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=291">Research by Margaret Blair cited in Citizens United dissent</a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on Feb 18, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-02-18T08:21:00</pubDate></item><item><title>Research by Paige Skiba cited in Seventh Circuit decision</title><guid>

David H. Mills, Director of the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions</em>, a case decided by Judges Richard Posner and Joel M. Flaum of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (sitting by designation).</p>
<p>Midwest Title, a car title lender with operations in Illinois, sought to stop Indiana from applying its interest-rate and fee limitations to loans made by Midwest&rsquo;s Illinois-based lending operations to Indiana residents who crossed the state border seeking loans, claiming that Indiana&rsquo;s attempt to enforce its restrictions on Illinois lenders violated the federal Commerce clause. Illinois permits car title lenders to charge interest rates that are more than 10 times higher than the maximum rates permitted under Indiana law, and more than 2,000 loans had been issued to Indiana residents by Illinois loan outlets.</p>
<p>The district court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting Indiana from applying its restrictions to the Illinois lenders, and the State of Indiana appealed that decision.</p>
<p>In its opinion affirming the district court&rsquo;s decision, the Seventh Circuit panel summarized a scholarly debate on whether allowing unsophisticated consumers to use a car title or future paycheck as collateral for high interest loans benefits or harms the consumers. &ldquo;Payday Loans, Uncertainty, and Discounting: Explaining Patters of Borrowing, Repayment, and Default,&rdquo; an article co-authored by Skiba and Jeremy Tobacman of the Wharton School of Business, was cited as indicating that such lenders prey on consumers who aren&rsquo;t savvy enough to understand that these loans offer very unfavorable terms and that other alternatives that offer lower interest rates and fees are available. Other research indicates that such lenders meet a need by enabling people who cannot borrow from a bank because they have poor credit to take out loans to meet urgent financial needs.</p>
<p>Although the decision acknowledged the academic debate over the benefits and drawback of payday and title loans, the panel concluded that &ldquo;we do not have to take sides.&rdquo; The Seventh Circuit Court affirmed the lower court&rsquo;s decision based on its conclusion that Indiana could not legally prohibit its citizens from going to Illinois to borrow from car title lenders there at terms legal in Illinois, nor could Indiana require lenders with no operations located in Indiana to adhere to its restrictions on loan terms and interest rates.</p><p style="padding:5px;background:#f1f1f1;border:1px solid #ccc;clear:both;"><a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=292">Research by Paige Skiba cited in Seventh Circuit decision</a> was originally published by <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt University Law School</a> on Feb 18, 2010.</p>]]></description><pubDate>2010-02-18T08:29:00</pubDate></item><item><title>2010 Moot Court winners announced</title><guid>

Nelson of New York University School of Law; Harvey Rishikof of the National War College; Scott Messinger, who is COO of The Constitution Project; and Michael Jo, a J.D. candidate at New York University who holds a Ph.D. from Yale &ndash; chose to focus on the impact of Supreme Court clerks after they leave the Court for two reasons. Another recent empirical analysis concluded that the clerks&rsquo; &ldquo;ideological predilections&rdquo; exert a significant influence on the Justices&rsquo; decisions that extends &ldquo;above and beyond the ideological orientation of each justice.&rdquo; In addition, after clerks leave the Court, they continue to &ldquo;exert considerable influence on the legal profession and the law&rdquo; throughout their legal careers, because they typically hold &ldquo;positions of power in government, private practice or the academy, and use those positions to transmit to others what they learned at the Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s authors assembled data on more than 90 percent of clerks who served between 1882 and 2006, based a list of former clerks provided by the Supreme Court; biographical information provided by law firms, government agencies and law schools; and public records.</p>
<p>While the authors found that &ldquo;From 1940 to 1990, former Supreme Court clerks developed into scholars of every political stripe,&rdquo; they assert that &ldquo;Around 1990, the conservative ascendancy began to produce transformations&rdquo; in clerkship hiring practices, and in patterns of post-clerkship employment. The study found that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&hellip;the four most conservative Justices serving for a significant length of time on the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts &ndash; Justice Anthony Kennedy, Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas &ndash; have shown remarkable partisan consistency in selecting their clerks. 92.4 percent of Justice Kennedy&rsquo;s clerks with prior federal clerkship experience, 79.4 percent of Chief Justice Rehnquist&rsquo;s, 92.7 percent of Justice Scalia&rsquo;s, and 100 percent of Justice Thomas&rsquo;s served with federal district or circuit court judges appointed by Republican presidents. In contrast, 58.0 percent of Justice Stephen Breyer&rsquo;s clerks with prior federal clerkship experience, 65.4 percent of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&rsquo;s, 64.1 percent of Justice Souter&rsquo;s, and 70.6 percent of Justice John Paul Stevens&rsquo;s came from Democratic-appointed judges. &hellip;Only Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor split her clerks evenly: 50.0 percent came from Republican-appointed and 50.0 percent from Democratic-appointed lower court judges.</p>
<p>Based on their examination of hiring practices dating from 1882, the authors note that &ldquo;Such polarization is unprecedented in the history of the Court.&rdquo; They conclude that &ldquo;statistical evidence supports the claim that the recent hiring of clerks by conservative judges has taken on an increasingly partisan character,&rdquo; and that these hiring practices &ldquo;correlate strongly&rdquo; with the career choices clerks make after leaving the Court. Clerks who serve the four conservative judges are much less likely to join the academy. Only 22 out of 330 clerks, or 6.7 percent, of former law clerks from the chambers of conservative Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas chose to teach law as a career. Those who did were far more likely to go to &ldquo;religiously oriented or otherwise conservative leaning&rdquo; law faculties than were clerks who served with Justice O&rsquo;Connor and the four liberal Justices. Those clerks reflected a long-term post-clerkship employment pattern; slightly more than a third (132 out of 361) of former clerks selected by Justice O&rsquo;Connor and the four liberal justices entered the legal academy, and 60 of these joined the faculties of schools considered &ldquo;elite&rdquo; by the study&rsquo;s authors.</p>
<p>The study also illuminates two other important trends: the creation of Supreme Court practice groups in large national firms, which began in the 1980s, and a dramatic increase in the number of former clerks who enter government service. The study found that clerks hired during each presidential administration tend to come from the chambers of Justices whose ideology reflects that of the party in power. Only 15 of the 96 clerks hired during the Clinton administration came from conservative chambers, and only 10 of the 89 former clerks hired under the Bush Administration came from the chambers of the four Justices dissenting in the <em>Bush v. Gore </em>decision. The study&rsquo;s authors draw two conclusions from these findings: &ldquo;The emergence of what looks like partisan hiring suggests that Supreme Court clerkships no longer constitute the single, coherent career track as they arguably did from the 1940s into the 1980s,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the growth of specialized appellate practices allows clerks in private practice to continue&rdquo; influencing the work of the Court long after their clerkship ends.</p>
<p>The study was published in the November 2009 issue of the <em><a href="retCmsId=1615">Vanderbilt Law Review</a></em>. It was selected for inclusion in spring 2009, while the journal was under the general leadership of 2008-09 Editor-in-Chief Scott Goldman, who is now clerking for Chief Judge Andrew S. Effron of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>Ryan Holt, the Law Review's current Editor-in-Chief, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been pleased with the reception this article has received. It is especially rewarding when an article that interests the academic community appeals to the broader public as well.&rdquo; After graduation,&nbsp;Holt will be clerking for Judge Gilbert S. Merritt Jr. '60 of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.<br />

http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=287</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=287</link><description><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=205">Randall Thomas</a>, who directs Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Law and Business Program, has had his research selected as among the &ldquo;Top 10 Corporate and Securities Articles&rdquo; by the <em>Corporate Practice Commentator </em>in each of the past five years.</p>
<p>Each of the five articles for which Professor Thomas was honored involves innovative empirical research that examines the impact of class action litigation and settlements. For example, in a 2005 <em>Stanford Law Review </em>article, &ldquo;Letting Billions Slip through Your Fingers: Empirical Evidence and Legal Implications of the Failure of Financial Institutions to Participate in Securities Class Action Settlements,&rdquo; Professor Thomas and coauthor James D. Cox of Duke Law School highlighted the high cost incurred by mutual fund investors and pension plan participants because institutional investors fail to claim their funds&rsquo; share of class action settlements.</p>
<p>In 2006, Thomas and Cox examined the impact of the lead plaintiff provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995 in an article published in the <em>Columbia Law Review</em>, &ldquo;Does the Plaintiff Matter? An Empirical Analysis of Lead Plaintiffs in Securities Class Actions.&rdquo; Under the provision, the investor with the largest financial interest in a securities fraud case is appointed lead plaintiff in the event of a class action suit. Professors Thomas and Cox found that the presence of an institutional investor as lead plaintive did increase the dollar amount of class action settlements.</p>
<p>In a follow-up article published in 2008 in the <em><a href="retCmsId=1615">Vanderbilt Law Review</a></em>, Thomas, Cox and Lynn Bai of University of Cincinnati Law School examined the impact of the type of lead plaintiff on the size of settlements in securities fraud class actions and found that &ldquo;there is no important difference in outcome associated with the lead plaintiff being a public pension fund versus a labor pension fund.&rdquo; This and other analyses yielded a final conclusion that &ldquo;the PSLRA is working and likely working well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>Corporate Practice Commentator</em>, which has been published since 1966, began polling corporate and securities law scholars and publishing a list of a &ldquo;top 10&rdquo; list of scholarly articles addressing corporate and securities law in 1994, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=194">Robert B. Thompson</a>, professor of law at Vanderbilt, who has served as editor of the <em>Commentator</em> since 1991. The <em>Commentator</em>, which is bound and sold by Thomson West, offers a compendium of top scholarly work in corporate and securities law.</p>
<p>To compile the &ldquo;top 10&rdquo; list of corporate and securities articles for <em>Corporate Practice Commentator</em>, Professor Thompson assembles a list of every article published during a preceding calendar year. &ldquo;The list has grown to more than 500 articles each year, so to be among the top 10 is quite selective,&rdquo; he says. Ballots are distributed to professors listed in the American Association of Law Schools directory as teaching either corporate or securities law; approximately 700 law faculty receive ballots.</p>
<p>Because of journal publication schedules, some articles are dated in the year prior to the year for which they were selected as among the top 10. The articles for which Professor Thomas was honored include:</p>

<p>The Order of Australia is an Australian Honour established by Royal Letters Patent and awarded by the Governor General on the recommendation of a non-political body, the Order of Australia Council. Membership of the Order (AM) is granted in recognition of &ldquo;service in a particular locality or field of activity or to a particular group&rdquo;. There are various levels of hierarchy in the Order, but Membership (AM) is limited nationally to 225 Australians per year.</p>
<p>Penguilley was a recipient in the 2009 Queen&rsquo;s Birthday Honours Awards &ldquo;for service to the law as a practitioner, regulator, academic and commentator in the areas of trade practices and franchising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pengilley&nbsp;was admitted as a lawyer in Australia before he earned his J.D. at Vanderbilt on a Rotary Foundation Fellowship. After graduating from Vanderbilt, he was appointed as a commissioner of the Australian Trade Practices Commission, which is similar to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission), and then spent several years in private practice.</p>
<p>He recently retired from the law faculty at the University of Newcastle, Australia, having spent 15 years teaching commercial law.</p>
<p>Pengilley&nbsp;credits his&nbsp;Vanderbilt education&nbsp;for starting him on the path to&nbsp;a successful career in competition law. &quot;My Vanderbilt study proved invaluable in later life,&quot; he explains. &quot;Much of my career&nbsp;involved competition law, which&nbsp;I studied at Vanderbilt at a time when Australia had no such law. I am proud to be a Vandy graduate, and there is certainly significant Vandy input into my AM.&rdquo;<br />

http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=286</guid><link>http://law.vanderbilt.edu/article-search/article-detail/index.aspx?nid=286</link><description><![CDATA[<p>African Americans long ago coined a term for the supposed offense for which they are stopped in disproportionate numbers by police: DWB, or Driving While Black.</p>
<p>On January 27 in Flynn Auditorium, the implications of the heightened security following 9-11 on police profiling were discussed by a panel that included <a target="_blank" href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=225">Chris Slobogin</a>, who holds Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Milton Underwood Chair in Law; ACLU Senior Staff Attorney Reggie Shuford; and David Singleton, Executive Director of the Ohio Justice and Policy Center. Panel members presented their experiences litigating profiling cases and answered questions about the conflict between security concerns and individual rights posed by Tarik Downie, president of the <a href="retCmsId=1207">Black Law Students Association (BLSA)</a>, which sponsored the discussion, and by audience members.</p>
<p>Most Hyatt events occur at noon, and some lure audience members by serving lunch. Although the BLSA-organized panel discussion, &quot;Profiling, Policy and Police Conduct in Post-9/11 Society,&rdquo; was scheduled at 6 p.m., it attracted a large audience.</p>
<p>BLSA&rsquo;s profiling panel was one of nine events during the 2010-11 academic year funded in part or entirely by the <a href="retCmsId=1088">Hyatt Student Activities Fund</a>, created by <strong>Wayne Hyatt (JD&rsquo;68, BA&rsquo;65)</strong>, and his late wife, <strong>Amanda Hyatt (MA&rsquo;74, BA&rsquo;67),</strong> to enable student organizations to bring high-profile speakers of their choosing to campus. Students apply for funding for events they wish to organize to Student Affairs Dean Julie Sandine, who administers the fund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hyatt Fund has been an invaluable resource for our student organizations, enabling them to bring in well-respected experts from all over the country as speakers and enrich the intellectual life of the law school,&rdquo; Sandine says. &ldquo;The Fund also fosters collaboration among our student organizations as they work together to plan and implement these programs. For example, OUTLaw and the Law Students for Veterans Affairs worked together to bring Emily Hecht to discuss the &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rdquo; policy. Our Women Law Students Association, Black Law Students Association, and the Law Students for Social Justice worked with the Provost&rsquo;s Office, the Bishop Johnson Black Cultural Center, the sociology department, the Undergraduate Speakers Committee and Trevecca Nazarene University to make the &ldquo;Picking Cotton&rdquo; program possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>C.J. Stimson, who will graduate from Vanderbilt with both J.D. and M.D. degrees in 2010, started working with other members of the <a href="retCmsId=1217">Health Law Society</a> to bring William Corr &rsquo;73, Deputy Secretary at the Department of Health &amp; Human Services, to the law school soon after Corr&rsquo;s appointment was confirmed in fall 2008. Corr will speak at the law school on March 25, thanks in part to the Hyatt Fund. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited this came together,&rdquo; Stimson says. &ldquo;The Hyatt Fund has a big impact on the quality of the speakers student groups can bring in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to Corr&rsquo;s talk, upcoming spring Hyatt events include a talk on executive power during wartime by former Bush legal advisor John Yoo presented by the <a href="retCmsId=1214">Federalist Society</a> and a panel discussion of Title IX Reform on March 23.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Title IX panel is a good example of how our student organizations work with other organizations on campus,&rdquo; Sandine says. &ldquo;It was organized by the Women Law Students Association and the Entertainment and Sports Law Society with support from the Hyatt Fund and from Vanderbilt&rsquo;s Margaret Cuninggim Women&rsquo;s Center.&rdquo; Panelists will include former Senator Birch Bayh, drafter of the Title IX bill, and <a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/faculty/faculty-detail/index.aspx?faculty_id=198" target="_blank">Vice Chancellor David Williams</a>, sports law professor at Vanderbilt, and the discussion will focus on whether regulations created to enforce Title IX compliance, such as the proportionality requirements, are in need of reform.</p>
<p>Hyatt events during Fall 2010 included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;Emily Hecht, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, who discussed the current status and potential repeal of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask Don&rsquo;t Tell,&rdquo; in a talk cosponsored by the <a href="retCmsId=2147">Law Students for Veteran Affairs</a> and <a href="retCmsId=1216">OUTLaw</a>.</li>
    <li>The Death Penalty, an Oxford-style debate featuring Dr. Ken Hass of the University of Delaware and Joshua Marquis, District Attorney for Clatsop County, Oregon, presented by the <a href="retCmsId=2146">Law Students for Social Justice</a>. Andrew Cunningham, Class of 2010, proposed this program, which more than 200 people attended.</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Picking Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and Redemption,&rdquo; a presentation by Jennifer Thompson-Cannino and Ronald Cotton about Cotton&rsquo;s wrongful accusation and incarceration for the rape of Thompson-Cannino, presented by the <a href="retCmsId=1240">Women Law Students Association (WLSA)</a>, BLSA and Law Students for Social Justice.</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Justice for All: An Introduction to Animal Law,&rdquo; a talk by Jonathan Lovvorn, Chief Counsel for Animal Protection Litigation and Research for the Humane Society of the United States, presented by the <a href="retCmsId=1205">Animal Law Society</a>.</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Freedom from Religion: National Religious Policy, Extremism, and the War on Terror: A Comparative Perspective,&rdquo; a lecture by Amos Guiora, professor of law at the University of Utah, sponsored by the <a href="retCmsId=1220">International Law Society</a>.</li>
