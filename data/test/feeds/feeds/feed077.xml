<title>Joseph Gordon-Levitt Joining  The Dark Knight Rises ? </title>
<pubDate>Feb  2, 2011</pubDate>
<description> Long rumored to play a part in Christopher Nolan's Batman sequel after his turn in the director's  Inception  last year, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is now reported by  Deadline  to be in talks for a role in  The Dark Knight Rises .

Currently filming Rian Johnson's  Looper , Gordon-Levitt has not officially been cast and, as of yet, there is no studio confirmation that he is even being sought to appear. That said, the actor has preemptively been the subject of much internet speculation regarding who he might play in the DC Universe and, as such, has certainly proven himself popular with Nolan fans.

 The Dark Knight Rises  is slated to feature the return of Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman, reprising their characters from  Batman Begins  and  The Dark Knight . Newcomers...</description>

<title> Fletch  Reboot Planned</title>
<pubDate>Feb  2, 2011</pubDate>
<description> Warner Bros. has plans to reboot the  Fletch  franchise,  Heat Vision  is reporting.

The Gregory McDonald novel series, first published in 1974 with "Fletch," offers a humorous take on an LA-based investigative journalist. The first book spawned 11 sequels and served as the basis for a 1985 film that starred Chevy Chase in the lead. Chase would return to the character in 1989 for a sequel,  Fletch Lives , not specifically based on any of the books.

For years the second book (which is a prequel to the first), "Fletch Won" has been eyed for a Hollywood adaptation and has, since the mid-2000's attracted prospective talent that ranged from Bill Lawrence directing with Zach Braff and/or Joshua Jackson amongst those rumored for the lead to a Kevin Smith version that...</description>

<title>Zach Galifianakis Joining Reynolds in  R.I.P.D. ?</title>
<pubDate>Feb  2, 2011</pubDate>
<description>  24 Frames  is reporting that Zach Galifianakis (upcoming  The Hangover Part II ) is in talks to join Ryan Reynolds in the Robert Schwentke-directed  R.I.P.D  adaptation at Universal Pictures:

  Galifianakis is in talks to play the co-lead in the film, according to two people with knowledge of the project who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. The movie is based on a popular Dark Horse comic about dead police officers patrolling the underworld.

Peter Lenkov created the comic -- the acronym stands for Rest In Peace Department -- which centers on the revenge sought by the recently murdered policeman Nick Cruz (Reynolds). Galifianakis would play another dead police officer.  

According to the site, the studio is planning on a summer start. Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay...</description>

<pubDate>Feb  2, 2011</pubDate>
<description>Disney's live-action version of their famous  Snow White  has found a writer in  Toy Story 3 's Michael Arndt and an intriguing set-up for the retelling: this version will take place in 19th Century China with the title  Snow and the Seven .

Francis Lawrence ( I Am Legend ,  Constantine ) is still attached to direct and Natalie Portman has, apparently, expressed interest in starring, though her casting may now be complicated by the actress' pregnancy.</description>

<title>Akiva Goldsman to Direct  Winter's Tale </title>
<pubDate>Feb  2, 2011</pubDate>
<description> Akiva Goldsman will be making his feature directorial debut on  Winter's Tale , an adaptation of the 1983 Mark Helprin novel which Goldsman wrote the screenplay for. The book is described as follows:

  Set in New York at the beginning and the end of the twentieth century, Winter�s Tale unfolds with such great narrative force and beauty that a reader can feel that its world is more real than his own. Standing alone on the page before the book begins are the words, I have been to another world, and come back. Listen to me. In that world, both winter and the city of New York (old and new) have the strength and character of protagonists, and the protagonists themselves move as if in a vivid dream. Though immensely complicated, the story is centered upon Peter Lake, a turn-of-the-century...</description>

<title>Javier Bardem Confirms Possible  Bond 23  Role</title>
<pubDate>Feb  1, 2011</pubDate>
<description> Following word over the weekend that Javier Bardem has been offered a major role in the upcoming (still untitled) 23rd  James Bond  film, the  LA Times  spoke with the actor and confirmed that the part in question is, indeed, the film's villain.

  "I�d be playing Bond's nemesis, yes,"   Bardem explains,   "but it's not that obvious. Everything is more nuanced. It's very intriguing... They're changing the whole thing, the whole dynamic."  

Bardem acknowledges his interest, saying that he's a big fan of the franchise, but will not make a decision until he has the opportunity to read the full script. That said, meetings so far with director Sam Mendes certainly seem to have left him intrigued.

If he takes the role, Bardem would mark the second Oscar winner to...</description>

<pubDate>Feb  1, 2011</pubDate>
<description> Cameron Diaz has signed on for  Gambit , the remake of the 1966 crime caper, reports  Deadline .

<title>Exclusive: Richard Roxburgh on  Sanctum </title>
<pubDate>Feb  1, 2011</pubDate>
<description> Sitting down with Aussie actor Richard Roxburgh, it's hard to spot even a trace of his character from  Sanctum . Talkative, charismatic and constantly smiling, Roxburgh's demeanor serves as stark contrast to his Frank McGuire, a deadly serious expert cave diver whose personality is every bit as cold and hard as the film's cave environment.

Though the character is fiction, the job itself is based on the true to life experiences of writer and producer Andrew Wight who, himself, lived through an exploration disaster that, thankfully, didn't turn as horrific as the events of the film. Also produced by James Cameron,  Sanctum  plays with 3D to create a tight, claustrophobic terror that Roxburgh's graven portrayal accentuates.

Classically trained and known for effortlessly moving...</description>

<title>Scarlett Johansson for Elena in  Uncharted ?</title>
<pubDate>Feb  1, 2011</pubDate>
<description>  Empire  chatted with Oscar-nominated  The Fighter  director David O. Russell about bringing  Uncharted: Drake's Fortune  to the big screen, a discussion in which he mentioned he likes Scarlett Johansson for the role of Elena:

  What is the situation with your Uncharted movie script? It seems such a natural game to turn into a movie... 
The game is very cinematic; there's no question about it. That's what I'm working on real hard and I'm writing it as we speak and I'm really excited to make it. I'd love Mark to be in it, I'd love Bob De Niro to be in it; I love the idea of growing them into a cinematic family; I think that's a really cool idea, but... I guess you'll have to wait until you see the script.

 What thoughts do you have about the love interest, Elena? 
Ah, Elena....</description>

<title>Sundance Review:  The Son of No One </title>
<pubDate>Feb  1, 2011</pubDate>
<description>  The Son of No One  
Written and directed by Dito Montiel
Starring Al Pacino, Channing Tatum, Ray Liotta, Katie Holmes, Tracy Morgan, Juliette Binoche, James Ransone, Jake Cherry 

 Rating:  4.5/10

Dito Montiel, director of "Fighting" and "The Guide to Recognizing Your Saints," returns to Sundance with his attempt at a police drama, using the same type of dual timeline storytelling he's used in his earlier films. Any hopes that three movies may have improved him as a filmmaker probably should have been left at the door of the Eccles Theater.

When Jonathan was a kid, he lived in the violent and dangerous Queensboro projects and he shot a junkie who was attacking him, then later was involved in the accidental death of another resident. 16 years later,...</description>

<description>  The New Yorker  has published an extensive piece on Guillermo del Toro written by Daniel Zalewski and culled from several hands-on interactions  and interviews spread over the past several years.  An impressive piece of work for fans of the artist, the article also touches on a number of projects that will hopefully soon see the light of day, including  At the Mountains of Madness  and  Frankenstein .

In addition to comments from del Toro, the piece features Zalewski's own descriptions of maquettes and production sketches at various stages of development.

  "In accordance with Mary Shelley�s description,"   he writes about one of the  Frankenstein  designs,   " the head appeared to have been stolen from a cadaver: there was exposed sinew around the jaw, and the...</description>

<title>Warner Bros. Takes  The Stand </title>
<pubDate>Feb  1, 2011</pubDate>
<description> Warner Bros. has plans to adapt Stephen King's 1978 novel "The Stand" for the big screen, says a story at  The Hollywood Reporter .

Previously adapted as a television miniseries in 1994, "The Stand" tells the story of a full-scale apocalypse, driven by the accidental release of a biological weapon and the ensuing struggle of good versus evil carried out by the world's final survivors.

The original article notes that discussion of the adaptation is at the very early stage and that it's still unclear whether the text would be adapted as just a single film. The original version of the book is famously massive, checking in at 823 (for the 1978 edition) pages and 1,141 in a "complete and uncut" edition released in 1990.</description>

<pubDate>Feb  1, 2011</pubDate>
<description> John Carter of Mars , which recently played release date musical chairs with  Prometheus , is about halfway done, says co-writer/director Andrew Stanton ( WALL�E ,  Finding Nemo ).

He told  MTV :   "I'm not in post-production � I'm in digital principal photography now, which goes on for the rest of 2011, so I'm only halfway through the movie."  

What can we expect when the big screen adaptation hits theaters on March 9, 2012?   "I didn't try to make it look like anything else. I really tried to make it its own thing. I tried to make a very historically accurate Martian film if that makes sense, so I'll let you decipher that."
